Background. The sequela of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an im por tant cause of in fant blind ness. This study was de signed to screen the high-risk pre ma ture in fants and in ves ti gate the in ci dence and risk fac tors as so ci ated with the de vel op ment of ROP. Methods. From Oc to ber 1997 to Oc to ber 1998, all pre ma ture in fants with birth body weight (BBW) less than 2000 gm or gestational age (GA) less than 36 weeks were en rolled and un der went ophthalmologic ex am i na tion at 4 to 6 weeks of age at Tai pei Vet erans Gen eral Hos pi tal. The perinatal vari ables were an a lyzed to eval u ate their cor re la tion with the de vel op ment of ROP. Results. In to tally 108 pre ma ture in fants, the in ci dence for de vel opment of ROP was 25% (27 in 108 pa tients). The thresh old ROP oc-
curred in 15 eyes (7%). The av er age BBW and GA (1267 ± 341 gm and 29.7 ± 2.7 weeks) were significantly lower in ROP group than in the non-ROP group (1703 ± 368 gm and 32.3 ± 2.2 weeks). The ar ti fi cial ventilation for more than 5 days, chronic lung disease and peri ventricular leukomalacia were sig nif i cant risk fac tors as so ci ated with highest rate of ROP. The respiratory dis tress syn drome, intra ven tricular hem or rhage, con gen i tal heart dis ease and sep sis were sig nif i cant risk fac tors ac com pa nied by mod er ate rate of ROP. Conclusion. Low birth body weight and young ges ta tional age are the most im por tant risk fac tors in the de vel op ment of ROP. The anal y sis of risk fac tors will be help ful in un der stand ing and pre dic tion of ROP forma tion in high-risk ne o nates. The timely clin i cal screen ing ret ina exam i na tion of high-risk pre ma ture in fants is im por tant to pre vent the devel op ment of ad vanced ROP.[Chin Med J (Taipei) 2001;64:706-712]

The retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is char ac terized by ab nor mal vas cu lar de vel op ment of ret ina in pre ma ture in fants, which is one of the ma jor causes of in fant blind ness. Its in ci dence in creases with the im prove ment in neo na tal sur vival in very low body weight pre ma ture in fants. How ever, there were few

ther apy, not all pre ma ture in fants de velop ROP. These ev i dences sug gested that risk fac tors other than ox ygen might play an im por tant role in the de vel op ment of ROP.
We con ducted this ret ro spec tive study to screen the high-risk pre ma ture ne o nates, with the main purpose to in ves ti gate the in ci dence of ROP and to de termine the pos si ble risk fac tors as so ci ated with the devel op ment of ROP.
Methods
There were to tally 108 pre ma ture in fants en rolled in this study from Oct. 1997 to Oct. 1998. The in clusion cri te ria were in fants who were, ei ther less than 36 weeks of ges ta tional age or less than 2000 gm of birth body weight, in the neo na tal new born room or in tensive care unit at Tai pei Vet erans Gen eral Hos pi tal.
The ophthalmic examination was initially performed to screen the high-risk pre ma ture in fants at postnatal age of 4 to 6 weeks under indirect ophthalmoscopy. The stage and se ver ity of ROP was classi fiedaccordingtotheinternationalclassifica tion of ROP (ICROP, Ta ble 1).3 The fol low-up ret ina ex am ination was performed every one or two weeks till ROP re gres sion, com plete vasculogenesis of ret ina or

the de vel op ment of thresh old ROP was ob served. All thresh old ROP cases were treated with cryotherapy or diode laser therapy using laser indirect ophtha lmoscopy. The thresh old se ver ity of ROP was de fined as five or more con tig u ous or eight cu mu la tive 30 sectors (clock hours) of stage 3 plus ROP in zone 1 or 2. The plus sign rep re sented the di la ta tion and tortuosity of the ret i nal blood ves sels in the pos te rior pole.
The perinatal vari ables (clin i cal data and pe di at ric illness) were recorded from the pediatric chart for each case, in clud ing the birth body weight, ges ta tional age, sex, birth place, du ra tion of ar ti fi cial ven ti la tion with ei ther me chanic ven ti la tor (IMV) or con tin u ous pos i tive air way pres sure (CPAP) more than 5 days, respi ra tory dis tress syn drome (RDS), chronic lung disease (CLD), intraventricular hem or rhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), con gen i tal heart disease (CHD), sep sis, hyperbilirubinemia and mul ti ple birth etc.. Each vari able was an a lyzed to eval u ate its cor re la tion with the de vel op ment of ROP.
Sta tis ti cal anal y sis was per formed with a com puterized program. Significance was tested with the chi-square test with Yates' cor rec tion and Fisher's exact test. The Odds ra tio for each pos si ble risk fac tor was also cal cu lated.
Results
Totally 108 premature infants underwent the screen ing ret ina ex am i na tion for ROP. The ges ta tional age ranged from 24 to 37 weeks (mean 31.6 ± 2.6 weeks); the birth body weight ranged from 620 to 2870 gm (mean 1594 ± 407 gm). There were 60 boys (55.6%) and 48 girls. The ma jor ity of pa tients were born at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (N = 96, 88.9%), and 12 (10.1%) patients were transferred

Discussion
The im por tance of the clin i cal screen ing ex am i nation of the fundus of high-risk pre ma ture in fants has been con firmed be cause of the im proved clin i cal outcome in in fants with acute, ac tive ROP af ter ei ther cryotherapy4-5 or transpupillary laser treatment.6-7 How ever, the op ti mal tim ing of ini tial screen ing ret inal ex am i na tion of ROP at nurs ery is still con tro versial. The earlier screen ing pro to col would re sult in many un nec es sary ex am i na tions, while later screening pro to col might fail to di ag nose the on set of threshold ROP and miss the golden time of ther apy. Ac cording to Palmer's re port,8 the 7th to 9th week af ter birth is the best time for yield ing the larg est num ber of ROP cases. Re cently, the Amer i can Acad emy of Pe di at rics, the Amer i can As so ci a tion for Pe di at ric Oph thal mology and Stra bis mus, and the Amer i can Acad emy of Ophthalmology released a joint statement rec ommend ing that the ini tial screen ing ex am i na tion should be per formed be tween the 4 and 6 weeks of chro nolog i cal age, or 31 and 33 weeks of postconceptional age.9 In our study, the screening protocol was performed be tween 4 and 6 weeks af ter birth. In the early course study of CRYO-ROP cooperativegroup,10 the tim ing of ret i nal vas cu lar events of ROP cor re lated more closely with the postconceptional age than the chro no log i cal age. They ob served that 95% of stage 2 ROP have the on set at 32 weeks or later. The thresh old ROP (stage 3) was reached at a mean of 36.9 weeks, in range of 33.6 to 42.0 weeks. There fore, most au thors agree that the initial screen ing per formed at 4 to 6 weeks af ter birth is ap pro pri ate and safe for the de tection of acute ROP.
The incidence of ROP varied according to the screen ing time and pro to col. The in ci dence of ROP in the cur rent study was 25%, which was higher than

most re ports in United States.11Our in clu sion cri te ria of screen ing was dif fer ent from other cen ters. We exam ined all pre ma ture in fants with body weight less than 2000 gm or ges ta tional age less than 36 weeks. As our hos pi tal is a re fer ral cen ter, many pre ma ture ba bies with very low body weight were trans ferred from other hos pi tals. The above two rea sons lead to the higher in ci dence of ROP in our study. The in cidence of thresh old ROP (7%) in our study was sim i lar to other re ports in lit er a ture.11
The pathogenesis of the de vel op ment of ROP is still un cer tain. Patz et al,12 in a pro spec tive con trolled trial, clearly dem on strated the causal ef fect of high ox y gen ad min is tra tion on the de vel op ment of ROP. How ever, the ox y gen ther apy is no lon ger the only and most im por tant fac tor of the de vel op ment of ROP. Re cent ob ser va tion has found ROP to be a dis ease of multifactorial or i gin, of which ox y gen ther apy is but one fac tor. 13,14The in di vid ual sus cep ti bil ity of pre mature in fants and many other fac tors may in volve in the de vel op ment of ROP. Ad di tional risk fac tors in clude low birth weight, younger gestational age, hypercarbia, acidosis, vitamin E deficiency, intracranial hem or rhage and mul ti ple blood trans fu sion.15 In the cur rent study, the ROP group had sta tis ti cally sig nif icant lower birth weight and youn ger ges ta tional age than the BBW and GA in the non-ROP group. The inci dence and se ver ity of ROP in the cur rent study were also higher in lower birth weight and young ges tational age categories. We concluded that the birth body weight and ges ta tional age are the most im portant risk fac tors in the de vel op ment of ROP, and are also the best in di ca tors of im ma tu rity in pre ma ture infants. In the cur rent study, the mul ti ple birth it self is not a risk fac tor of ROP de vel op ment, co ex is tence of low body weight and ges ta tional age is even more important.16
In our study, the artificial ventilation for more than 5 days is a sta tis ti cally sig nif i cant risk fac tors in the de vel op ment of ROP. The du ra tion of ven ti la tion is usu ally as so ci ated with a lon ger time of high concen tra tion of ox y gen ther apy. Dur ing the nor mal embryonic development, the retinal vessels begin to

grow out ward from the op tic disc in the 4th month, and do not reach the ora serrata un til nearly fullterm. The ret ina of pre ma ture new born is there fore in com pletely vascularized with a pe riph eral avascular zone. In the ret ina of ROP in fants, nor mal ret i nal blood ves sel devel op ment ar rests, and vaso-obliteration of some preex ist ing ret i nal ves sels oc curs. It has been sug gested that the rel a tive hyperoxia of extrauterine en vi ronment under high concentration of oxygen therapy causes the sup pres sion of nor mal ves sel de vel op ment and vaso-obliteration.17 In an i mal model of ox y geninduced retinopathy, an as so ci a tion be tween ex po sure to hyperoxia and vaso-obliteration has been observed.18 The ischemic ret ina sub se quently pro duces angiogenic factors, in which vascular endothelial growth fac tor plays a ma jor role to re sult in ret i nal neovascularization for ma tion in ROP.19
Sev eral other risk fac tors were clearly found to cor re late with the de vel op ment of ROP in the current study. Respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung dis ease were known to as so ci ate with systemic hypoxia, which will lead to retina ischemia. The etiology of periventricular leukomalasia comes from hypoxia and blood hypo perfusion of ce re brum which even tu ally has sim i lar in flu ence on the ret ina ischemia. Sep sis in the low body weight pre ma ture in fants is fre quently ac compa nied with hypotension which will im pair tis sue per fu sion with lo cal hypoxia to ren der ret ina un der the risk of ROP de vel op ment.
In con clu sion, the anal y sis of risk fac tors of the de vel op ment of ROP will help un der stand and pre dict ROP for ma tion in high-risk ne o nates. Since ROP may produce serious sequela of infant blindness, effort must be made to pre vent the de vel op ment of ad vanced ROP. Timely screen ing eye ex am i na tion of high risk pre ma ture in fants is very im por tant.
