Abstract
This paper concerns the assessment of the effects of actions or policy interventions from a combination of: (i) nonexperimental data, and (ii) substantive assumptions. The assumptions are encoded in the form of a directed acyclic graph, also called "causal graph", in which some variables are presumed to be unobserved. The paper establishes a necessary and sufficient criterion for the identifiability of the causal effects of a singleton variable on all other variables in the model, and a powerful sufficient criterion for the effects of a singleton variable on any set of variables.
Introduction
This paper explores the feasibility of inferring cause effect relationships from various combinations of data and theoretical assumptions. The assumptions considered will be represented in the form of an acyclic causal diagram which contains both arrows and bi-directed arcs (Pearl 1995; 2000). The arrows represent the potential existence of direct causal relationships between the corresponding variables, and the bi-directed arcs represent spurious dependencies due to unmeasured confounders. Our main task will be to decide whether the assumptions represented in any given diagram are sufficient for assessing the strength of causal effects from nonexperimental data and, if sufficiency is proven, to express the target causal effect in terms of estimable quantities.
It is well known that, in the absence of unmeasured confounders, all causal effects are identifiable, that is, the joint response of any set Y of variables to intervention on a set T of treatment variables, denoted Pt(y),1 can be estimated consistently from nonexperimental data (Robins 1987; Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993; Pearl 1993). If some confounders are not measured, then the question of identifiability arises, and whether the desired quantity can be estimated depends critically on the precise locations (in the diagram) of those confounders vis a vis the sets T and Y . Sufficient graphical conditions for ensuring the identification of Pt(y) were established by several

1(Pearl 1995; 2000) used the notation P (y|set(t)), P (y|do(t)), or P (y|t^) for the post-intervention distribution, while (Lauritzen 2000) used P (y||t).

authors (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993; Pearl 1993; 1995) and are summarized in (Pearl 2000, Chapters 3 and 4). For example, a criterion called "back-door" permits one to determine whether a given causal effect Pt(y) can be obtained by "adjustment", that is, whether a set C of covariates exists such that

Pt(y) = P (y|c, t)P (c)
c

(1)

When there exists no set of covariates that is sufficient for adjustment, causal effects can sometimes be estimated by invoking multi-stage adjustments, through a criterion called "front-door" (Pearl 1995). More generally, identifiability can be decided using do-calculus derivations (Pearl 1995), that is, a sequence of syntactic transformations capable of reducing expressions of the type Pt(y) to subscript-free expressions. Using do-calculus as a guide, (Galles & Pearl 1995) devised a graphical criterion for identifying Px(y) (where X and Y are singletons) that combines and expands the "front-door" and "back-door" criteria (see (Pearl 2000, pp. 114-8)).
This paper develops new graphical identification criteria that generalize and simplify existing criteria in several ways. We show that Px(v), where X is a singleton and V is the set of all variables excluding X, is identifiable if and only if there is no consecutive sequence of confounding arcs between X and X's immediate successors in the diagram.2 When interest lies in the effect of X on a subset S of outcome variables, not on the entire set V , it is possible that Px(s) would be identifiable even though Px(v) is not. To this end, the paper gives a sufficient criterion for identifying Px(s), which is an extension of the criterion for identifying Px(v). It says that Px(s) is identifiable if there is no consecutive sequence of confounding arcs between X and X's children in the subgraph composed of the ancestors of S. Other than this requirement, the diagram may have an arbitrary structure, including any number of confounding arcs between X and S. This simple criterion is shown to cover all criteria reported in the literature (with X singleton), including the "back-door", "front-door", and those developed by (Galles & Pearl 1995).

2A variable Z is an "immediate successor" (or a "child") of X if there exists an arrow X  Z in the diagram.

Notation, Definitions, and Problem
Formulation
The use of causal models for encoding distributional and causal assumptions is now fairly standard (see, for example, (Pearl 1988; Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993; Greenland, Pearl, & Robins 1999; Lauritzen 2000; Pearl 2000)). The simplest such model, called Markovian, consists of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) over a set V = {V1, . . . , Vn} of vertices, representing variables of interest, and a set E of directed edges, or arrows, that connect these vertices. The interpretation of such a graph has two components, probabilistic and causal. The probabilistic interpretation views the arrows as representing probabilistic dependencies among the corresponding variables, and the missing arrows as representing conditional independence assertions: Each variable is independent of all its nondescendants given its direct parents in the graph.3 These assumptions amount to asserting that the joint probability function P (v) = P (v1, . . . , vn) factorizes according to the product

P (v) = P (vi|pai)
i

(2)

where pai are (values of) the parents of variable Vi in the graph.4
The causal interpretation views the arrows as representing causal influences between the corresponding variables. In this interpretation, the factorization of (2) still holds, but the factors are further assumed to represent autonomous datageneration processes, that is, each conditional probability P (vi|pai) represents a stochastic process by which the values of Vi are chosen in response to the values pai (previously chosen for Vi's parents), and the stochastic variation of this assignment is assumed independent of the variations in all other assignments. Moreover, each assignment process remains invariant to possible changes in the assignment processes that govern other variables in the system. This modularity assumption enables us to predict the effects of interventions, whenever interventions are described as specific modifications of some factors in the product of (2). The simplest such intervention involves fixing a set T of variables to some constants T = t, which yields the post-intervention distribution

Pt(v) =

{i|ViT } P (vi|pai) v consistent with t. 0 v inconsistent with t.
(3)

Eq. (3) represents a truncated factorization of (2), with factors corresponding to the manipulated variables removed. This truncation follows immediately from (2) since, assuming modularity, the post-intervention probabilities P (vi|pai)

3We use family relationships such as "parents," "children," "ancestors," and "descendants," to describe the obvious graphical relationships. For example, the parents P Ai of node Vi are the set of nodes that are directly connected to Vi via arrows pointing to Vi.
4We use uppercase letters to represent variables or sets of variables, and use corresponding lowercase letters to represent their values (instantiations).

corresponding to variables in T are either 1 or 0, while those corresponding to unmanipulated variables remain unaltered.5 If T stands for a set of treatment variables and Y for an outcome variable in V \T , then Eq. (3) permits us to calculate the probability Pt(y) that event Y = y would occur if treatment condition T = t were enforced uniformly over the population. This quantity, often called the causal effect of T on Y , is what we normally assess in a controlled experiment with T randomized, in which the distribution of Y is estimated for each level t of T .
We see from Eq. (3) that the model needed for predicting the effect of interventions requires the specification of three elements

M = V, G, P (vi|pai)
where (i) V = {V1, . . . , Vn} is a set of variables, (ii) G is a directed acyclic graph with nodes corresponding to the elements of V , and (iii) P (vi|pai), i = 1, . . . , n, is the conditional probability of variable Vi given its parents in G. Since P (vi|pai) is estimable from nonexperimental data whenever V is observed, we see that, given the causal graph G, all causal effects are estimable from the data as well.6
Our ability to estimate Pt(v) from nonexperimental data is severely curtailed when some variables in a Markovian model are unobserved, or, equivalently, if two or more variables in V are affected by unobserved confounders; the presence of such confounders would not permit the decomposition in (2). Let V and U stand for the sets of observed and unobserved variables, respectively. Assuming that no U variable is a descendant of any V variable (called a semiMarkovian model), the observed probability distribution, P (v), becomes a mixture of products:

P (v) =

P (vi|pai, ui)P (u)

ui

(4)

where pai and ui stand for the sets of the observed and unobserved parents of Vi, and the summation ranges over all the U variables. The post-intervention distribution, likewise,
will be given as a mixture of truncated products

Pt(v)
P (vi|pai, ui)P (u) = u {i|ViT }
0

v consistent with t.
v inconsistent with t. (5)

and, the question of identifiability arises, i.e., whether it is possible to express Pt(v) as a function of the observed distribution P (v).
Formally, our semi-Markovian model consists of five elements
M = V, U, GV U , P (vi|pai, ui), P (u)

5Eq. (3) was named "Manipulation Theorem" in (Spirtes, Glymour, & Scheines 1993), and is also implicit in Robins' (1987) G-computation formula.
6It is in fact enough that the parents of each variable in T be observed (Pearl 2000, p. 78).

568 AAAI-02

where GV U is a causal graph consisting of variables in V × U . Clearly, given M and any two sets T and S in V , Pt(s) can be determined unambiguously using (5). The question of identifiability is whether a given causal effect Pt(s) can be determined uniquely from the distribution P (v) of the observed variables, and is thus independent of the unknown quantities, P (u) and P (vi|pai, ui), that involve elements of U.
In order to analyze questions of identifiability, it is convenient to represent our modeling assumptions in the form of a graph G that does not show the elements of U explicitly but, instead, represents the confounding effects of U using bidirected edges. A bidirected edge between nodes Vi and Vj represents the presence (in GV U ) of a divergent path Vi Uk Vj going strictly through elements of U . The presence of such bidirected edges in G represents unmeasured factors (or confounders) that may influence two variables in V ; we assume that substantive knowledge permits us to decide if such confounders can be ruled out from the model. See Figure 1 for an example graph with bidirected edges.
Definition 1 (Causal-Effect Identifiability) The causal effect of a set of variables T on a disjoint set of variables S is said to be identifiable from a graph G if the quantity Pt(s) can be computed uniquely from any positive probability of the observed variables--that is, if PtM1 (s) = PtM2 (s) for every pair of models M1 and M2 with P M1 (v) = P M2 (v) > 0 and G(M1) = G(M2) = G.
In other words, the quantity Pt(s) can be determined from the observed distribution P (v) alone; the details of M are irrelevant.

The Identification of Px(v)
Let X be a singleton variable. In this section we study the problem of identifying the causal effect of X on V = V \ {X}, (namely, on all other variables in V ), a quantity denoted by Px(v).

The easiest case

Theorem 1 If there is no bidirected edge connected to X, then Px(v) is identifiable and is given by

Px(v) = P (v|x, pax)P (pax)

(6)

Proof: Since there is no bidirected edge connected to X, then the term P (x|pax, ux) = P (x|pax) in Eq. (4) can be
moved ahead of the summation, giving

P (v) = P (x|pax)

P (vi|pai, ui)P (u)

u {i|Vi=X}

= P (x|pax)Px(v).

(7)

Hence,

Px(v) = P (v)/P (x|pax) = P (v|x, pax)P (pax). (8)
2 Theorem 1 also follows from Theorem 3.2.5 of (Pearl 2000) which states that for any disjoint sets S and T in a Markovian model M , if the parents of T are measured, then Pt(s) is identifiable.

A more interesting case

The case where there is no bidirected edge connected to any
child of X is also easy to handle. Letting Chx denote the set of X's children, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 2 If there is no bidirected edge connected to any child of X, then Px(v) is identifiable and is given by

Px(v) =

P (vi|pai)

{i|Vi C hx }

x

P (v) {i|ViChx} P (vi|pai)
(9)

Proof: Let S = V \ (Chx  {X}) and A = {i|ViS} P (vi|pai, ui). Since there is no bidirected edge
connected to any child of X, the factors corresponding to
the variables in Chx can be moved ahead of the summation in Eqs. (4) and (5). We have

P (v) =

P (vi|pai)

{i|Vi C hx }

P (x|pax, ux) · A · P (u),
u
(10)

and

Px(v) =

P (vi|pai) A · P (u).

{i|Vi C hx }

u

(11)

The variable X does not appear in the factors of A, hence we augment A with the term x P (x|pax, ux) = 1, and write

A·P (u) =

P (x|pax, ux) · A · P (u)

u xu

=
x

P (v) . (by (10))
{i|ViChx} P (vi|pai)

(12)

Substituting this expression into Eq. (11) leads to Eq. (9). 2

The usefulness of Theorem 2 can be demonstrated in the model of Figure 1. Although the diagram is quite complicated, Theorem 2 is applicable, and readily gives

P x(z1, z2, z3, y) = P (z1|x, z2)
x

P (x , z1, z2, z3, y) P (z1|x , z2)

= P (z1|x, z2) P (y, z3|x , z1, z2)P (x , z2). (13)

Figure 2:

The general case
When there are bidirected edges connected to the children of X, it may still be possible to identify Px(v). To illustrate, consider the graph in Figure 2, for which we have

P (v) = P (x|u1)P (z2|z1, u1)P (u1)
u1
· P (z1|x, u2)P (y|x, z1, z2, u2)P (u2),
u2
and

(14)

Px(v) = P (z2|z1, u1)P (u1)
u1
· P (z1|x, u2)P (y|x, z1, z2, u2)P (u2). (15)
u2
Let

Q1 = P (x|u1)P (z2|z1, u1)P (u1),
u1

(16)

and

Q2 = P (z1|x, u2)P (y|x, z1, z2, u2)P (u2).
u2
Eq. (14) can then be written as

(17)

P (v) = Q1 · Q2,

(18)

and Eq. (15) as

Px(v) = Q2 Q1.
x

(19)

Thus, if Q1 and Q2 can be computed from P (v), then Px(v) is identifiable and given by Eq. (19). In fact, it is enough to
show that Q1 can be computed from P (v) (i.e., identifiable); Q2 would then be given by P (v)/Q1. To show that Q1 can indeed be obtained from P (v), we sum both sides of Eq. (14)
over y, and get

P (x, z1, z2) = Q1 · P (z1|x, u2)P (u2).
u2
Summing both sides of (20) over z2, we get
P (x, z1) = P (x) P (z1|x, u2)P (u2),
u2

(20) (21)

hence,

P (z1|x, u2)P (u2) = P (z1|x).
u2
From Eqs. (22) and (20), Q1 = P (x, z1, z2)/P (z1|x) = P (z2|x, z1)P (x),
and from Eq. (18), Q2 = P (v)/Q1 = P (y|x, z1, z2)P (z1|x).
Finally, from Eq. (19), we obtain

(22) (23) (24)

Px(v) = P (y|x, z1, z2)P (z1|x) P (z2|x , z1)P (x ).
x
(25)

From the preceding example, we see that because the two bidirected arcs in Figure 2 do not share a common node, the set of factors (of P (v)) containing U1 is disjoint of those containing U2, and P (v) can be decomposed into a product of two terms, each being a summation of products. This decomposition, to be treated next, plays an important role in the general identifiability problem.

C-components Let a path composed entirely of bidirected edges be called a bidirected path. The set of variables V can be partitioned into disjoint groups by assigning two variables to the same group if and only if they are connected by a bidirected path. Assume that V is thus partitioned into k groups S1, . . . , Sk, and denote by Nj the set of U variables that are parents of those variables in Sj. Clearly, the sets N1, . . . , Nk form a partition of U . Define

Qj =

P (vi|pai, ui)P (nj), j = 1, . . . , k.

nj {i|ViSj }

(26)

The disjointness of N1, . . . , Nk implies that P (v) can be decomposed into a product of Qj's:

k
P (v) = Qj.
j=1

(27)

We will call each Sj a c-component (abbreviating "confounded component") of V in G or a c-component of G, and
Qj the c-factor corresponding to the c-component Sj. For example, in the model of Figure 2, V is partitioned into the c-components S1 = {X, Z2} and S2 = {Z1, Y }, the corresponding c-factors are given in equations (16) and (17), and
P (v) is decomposed into a product of c-factors as in (18).
Let P a(S) denote the union of a set S and the set of parents of S, that is, P a(S) = S  (ViSP Ai). We see that Qj is a function of P a(Sj). Moreover, each Qj can be interpreted as the post-intervention distribution of the variables
in Sj, under an intervention that sets all other variables to constants, or

Qj = Pv\sj (sj )

(28)

The importance of the c-factors stems from that all cfactors are identifiable, as shown in the following lemma.

570 AAAI-02

Lemma 1 Let a topological order over V be V1 < . . . < Vn, and let V (i) = {V1, . . . , Vi}, i = 1, . . . , n, and V (0) = . For any set C, let GC denote the subgraph of G composed only of variables in C. Then
(i) Each c-factor Qj, j = 1, . . . , k, is identifiable and is given by

Qj =

P (vi|v(i-1)).

{i|ViSj }

(29)

(ii) Each factor P (vi|v(i-1)) can be expressed as

P (vi|v(i-1)) = P (vi|pa(Ti) \ {vi}),

(30)

where Ti is the c-component of GV (i) that contains Vi.
Proof: We prove (i) and (ii) simultaneously by induction on the number of variables n.
Base: n = 1; we have one c-component Q1 = P (v1), which is identifiable and is given by Eq. (29), and Eq. (30) is satisfied.
Hypothesis: When there are n variables, all c-factors are identifiable and are given by Eq. (29), and Eq. (30) holds for all Vi  V .
Induction step: When there are n + 1 variables in V , assuming that V is partitioned into ccomponents S1, . . . , Sl, S , with corresponding c-factors Q1, . . . , Ql, Q , and that Vn+1  S , we have

P (v) = Q Qi.
i
Summing both sides of (31) over vn+1 leads to

(31)

P (v(n)) = ( Q ) Qi.

vn+1

i

(32)

It is clear that each Si, i = 1, . . . , l, is a c-component of GV (n) . By the induction hypothesis, each Qi, i = 1, . . . , l, is identifiable and is given by Eq. (29). From Eq. (31), Q is
identifiable as well, and is given by

Q

=

P (v) i Qi

=

{i|Vi S

P (vi|v(i-1)),
}

(33)

which is clear from Eq. (29) and the chain decomposition P (v) = i P (vi|v(i-1)).
By the induction hypothesis, Eq. (30) holds for i from 1
to n. Next we prove that it holds for Vn+1. In Eq. (33), Q is a function of P a(S ), and each term P (vi|v(i-1)), Vi  S and Vi = Vn+1, is a function of P a(Ti) by Eq. (30), where Ti is a c-component of the graph GV (i) and therefore is a subset of S . Hence we obtain that P (vn+1|v(n)) is a function only of P a(S ) and is independent of C = V \
P a(S ), which leads to

P (vn+1|pa(S ) \ {vn+1})
= P (vn+1|v(n))P (c|pa(S ) \ {vn+1})
c
= P (vn+1|v(n)) P (c|pa(S ) \ {vn+1})
c
= P (vn+1|v(n))

The proposition (ii) in Lemma 1 can also be proved by using
d-separation criterion (Pearl 1988) to show that Vi is independent of V (i) \ P a(Ti) given P a(Ti) \ {Vi}.
We show the use of Lemma 1 by an example shown in Figure 3, which has two c-components S1 = {X2, X4} and S2 = {X1, X3, Y }. P (v) decomposes into

P (x1, x2, x3, x4, y) = Q1Q2,

(35)

where

Q1 = P (x2|x1, u2)P (x4|x3, u2)P (u2),

(36)

Q2 =

P (x1|u1)P (x3|x2, u1, u3)P (y|x4, u3)

u1 ,u3

· P (u1)P (u3).

(37)

By Lemma 1, both Q1 and Q2 are identifiable. The only admissible order of variables is X1 < X2 < X3 < X4 < Y , and Eq. (29) gives

Q1 = P (x4|x1, x2, x3)P (x2|x1), Q2 = P (y|x1, x2, x3, x4)P (x3|x1, x2)P (x1).

(38) (39)

We can also check that the expressions obtained in Eq.s (23) and (24) for Figure 2 satisfy Lemma 1.

The identification criterion for Px(v) Let X belong to the c-component SX with corresponding c-factor QX . Let
QxX denote the c-factor QX with the term P (x|pax, ux) removed, that is,

QXx =

P (vi|pai, ui)P (nX ).

nX {i|Vi=X,ViSX }

(40)

We have

P (v) = QX Qi,
i
Px(v) = QxX Qi.
i

(41) (42)

Since all Qi's are identifiable, Px(v) is identifiable if and only if QXx is identifiable, and we have the following theorem.
Theorem 3 Px(v) is identifiable if and only if there is no bidirected path connecting X to any of its children. When

AAAI-02 571

Px(v) is identifiable, it is given by

P (v) Px(v) = QX

QX ,

(43)

where QX is the c-factor corresponding to the c-component SX that contains X.

Proof: (if) If there is no bidirected path connecting X to any of its children, then none of X's children is in SX . Under this condition, removing the term P (x|pax, ux) from QX is equivalent to summing QX over X, and we can write

QXx = QX .

Hence from Eq.s (42) and (41), we obtain

which proves the identifiability of Px(v). (only if) Sketch: Assuming that there is a bidirected

models (by specifying all conditional probabilities) such

that P (v) has the same values in both models while Px(v)

takes different values. The proof is lengthy and is given in

(Tian & Pearl 2002).

We demonstrate the use of Theorem 3 by identifying
Px1 (x2, x3, x4, y) in Figure 3. The graph has two ccomponents S1 = {X2, X4} and S2 = {X1, X3, Y }, with corresponding c-factors given in (38) and (39). Since X1 is in S2 and its child X2 is not in S2, Theorem 3 ensures that Px1 (x2, x3, x4, y) is identifiable and is given by

P x1 (x2, x3, x4, y) = Q1 Q2

A Criterion for Identifying Px(s)
Let X be a singleton variable and S  V be any set of variables. Clearly, whenever Px(v) is identifiable, so is Px(s). However, there are obvious cases where Px(v) is not identifiable and still Px(s) is identifiable for some subsets S of V . In this section we give a criterion for identifying Px(s).
Let An(S) denote the union of a set S and the set of ancestors of the variables in S, and let GAn(S) denote the subgraph of G composed only of variables in An(S). Summing both sides of Eq. (4) over V \ An(S), we have that the marginal distribution P (an(S)) decomposes exactly according to the graph GAn(S). Therefore, if Px(s) is identifiable in GAn(S), then it is computable from P (an(S)), and thus is computable from P (v). A direct extension of Theorem 3 then leads to the following sufficient criterion for identifying Px(s).
Theorem 4 Px(s) is identifiable if there is no bidirected path connecting X to any of its children in GAn(S).

When the condition in Theorem 4 is satisfied, we can compute Px(an(S)) by applying Theorem 3 in GAn(S), and Px(s) can be obtained by marginalizing over Px(an(S)).
This simple criterion can classify correctly all the examples treated in the literature with X singleton, including those contrived by (Galles & Pearl 1995). In fact, for X and S being singletons, it is shown in the Appendix that if there is a bidirected path connecting X to one of its children such that every node on the path is in An(S), then none of the "back-door", "front-door", and (Galles & Pearl 1995) criteria is applicable. However, this criterion is not necessary for identifying Px(s). Examples exist in which Px(s) is identifiable but Theorem 4 is not applicable.7 An improved criterion that covers those cases is described in (Tian & Pearl 2002).
Conclusion
We developed new graphical criteria for identifying the causal effects of a singleton variable on a set of variables. Theorem 4 has important ramifications to the theory and practice of observational studies. It implies that the key to identifiability lies not in blocking back-door paths between X and S but, rather, in blocking back-door paths between X and its immediate successors on the pathways to S. The potential of finding and measuring intermediate variables that satisfy this condition opens new vistas in experimental design.

Appendix
In this appendix we show that Theorem 4 covers the criterion in (Galles & Pearl 1995) (which will be called the G-P criterion). The G-P criterion is for identifying Px(y) with X and Y being singletons, and it includes the "front-door" and "back-door" criteria as special cases (see (Pearl 2000, pp. 114-8)). We will prove that if there is a bidirected path connecting X to one of its children such that every node on the path is an ancestor of Y , then the G-P criterion is not applicable. There are four conditions in the G-P criterion, among which Condition 1 is a special case of Condition 3, and Condition 2 is trivial. Therefore we only need to consider Condition 3 and 4.
Proof: Assume that there is a bidirected path p from X to its child Y1 such that every node on p is an ancestor of Y , and that there is a directed path q from Y1 to Y . We will show by contradiction that neither Condition 3 nor Condition 4 is applicable for identifying Px(y). For any set Z, a node will be called Z-active if it is in Z or any of its descendants is in Z, otherwise it will be called Z-inactive.
(Condition 3) Assume that there exists a set Z that blocks all back-door paths from X to Y so that Px(z) is identifi-
7This implies that, contrary to claims, the criterion developed in (Galles & Pearl 1995) is not complete.

able.8 If every internal node on p is an ancestor of X, or if
every nonancestor of X on p is Z-active, then let W1 = Y1, otherwise let W1 be the Z-inactive non-ancestor of X that is closest to X on p (see Figure 4). If every internal node on the subpath p(W1, X) 9 is Z-active, then let W2 = X, otherwise let W2 be the Z-inactive node that is closest to W1 on p(W1, X). From the definition of W1 and W2, W2 must be an ancestor of X (or be X itself), and let p1 be any directed path from W2 to X. (i) If W1 = Y1, letting p2 be any directed path from W1 to Y , then from the definition of W1 and W2 the path p = (p1(X, W2), p(W2, W1), p2(W1, Y )) is a back-door path from X to Y that is not blocked by Z
(see Figure 4) since W2 is Z-inactive, all internal nodes on p(W2, W1) is Z-active, and W1 is Z-inactive. (ii) If W1 = Y1, there are two situations:
(a) Z consists entirely of nondescendants of X. Then the
path p = (p1(X, W2), p(W2, Y1), q(Y1, Y )) is a back-door path from X to Y that is not blocked by Z.
(b) Z contains a variable Y on q(Y1, Y ) so that Px(z) is identifiable. By the definition of W1, every node on p is an ancestor of Z. Px(z) can not be identified by Theorem 4, and the G-P criterion is not applicable for identifying Px(z) if Z contains more than one variable. If Z contains only
one variable Y , then every node on p is an ancestor of Y .
If Px(y ) is identifiable by Condition 3 of the G-P criterion (Condition 4 is not applicable as proved later), then from
the preceding analysis there is a Y on the path q(Y1, Y ) such that every node on p is an ancestor of Y and Px(y ) is identifiable. By induction, in the end we have every node
on p is an ancestor of Y1 and Px(y1) is identifiable, which does not hold from the preceding analysis.
(Condition 4) Assume that there exist sets Z1 and Z2 that satisfy all (i)­(iv) conditions in Condition 4. Since Z1 has to block the path ((X, Y1), q(Y1, Y )), let V1 be the variable in Z1 that is closest to Y1 on the path q (see Figure 5(a)). If none of the internal node on p is in An(V1) \ An(X) (the set of ancestors of V1 that are not ancestors of X) or if every

an arrow into X. 9We use p(W1, X) to represent the subpath of p from W1 to X.

variable in An(V1)\An(X) on p is Z2-active, then let W1 = Y1, otherwise let W1 be the Z2-inactive variable in An(V1)\

An(X) that is closest to X on p. Let p1 be any directed

path from W1 to V1. If every internal node on the subpath

p(W1, X) is Z2-active, then let W2 = X, otherwise let W2

be the Z2-inactive node that is closest to W1 on p(W1, X).

Since W2 must be an ancestor of Y , from the definition of

W1 and W2, there are two possible situations:

(a) W2 is an ancestor of X or W2 = X. Let p2

be any directed path from W2 to X (see Figure 5(a)).

From the definition of W1 and W2, the path p =

(p2(X, W2), p(W2, W1), p1(W1, V1)) is a back-door path from X to V1  Z1 that is not blocked by Z2 that does

not contain any descendant of X (see Figure 5(a)).

(b) W2 is an ancestor of Y but not ancestor of V1 (W2  An(Y ) \ An(V1)). Let p3 be any directed path from

W2 to Y (see Figure 5(b)). From the definition of W1 and

W2, the path p = (p1(V1, W1), p(W1, W2), p3(W2, Y )) is

a back-door path from V1  Z1 to Y that is not blocked by

Z2 (see Figure 5(b)).
