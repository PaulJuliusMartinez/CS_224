The ERK pathway is typically associated with activation of the EGF receptor and has been shown to play a major role in promoting several tumor phenotypes. An analogous signaling module, the JNK pathway, has not been shown to be consistently activated by the EGF receptor but is instead more uniformly stimulated by cellular stresses and cytokines. The function of the JNK pathway in primary tumors is unclear as it has been implicated in both promoting apoptosis and cell growth in vitro, which may be a reflection of the cell lines chosen. Primary human brain tumors frequently show overexpression of the EGF receptor. To clarify the role of JNK in tumorigenesis, we have investigated the role of JNK in a large panel of primary human brain tumors and tumor derived cell lines. Here we present evidence that JNK has a major role in promoting tumorigenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 86% (18 of 21) of primary brain tumors showed evidence of JNK activation but only 38% (8 of 21) showed evidence of ERK activation. Kinase assays revealed that 77% of brain tumor cell lines activated JNK in response to EGF (7 of 13) or had high levels of basal activity (3 of 13), whereas none of six normal cell lines analysed, including astrocytes, had these properties. Of several growth factors examined, EGF produced the highest level of JNK induction in tumor cell lines and the duration of activation was greater than that seen for ERK. Expression of a dominant-negative (dn) form of JNK potently inhibited EGF mediated anchorage independent growth and protection from cell death in two glial tumor cell lines. These findings demonstrate that enhanced JNK activation is frequently found in primary brain tumors and that this activation contributes to phenotypes related to transformation.

Introduction
The MAP kinase signaling modules, which include the ERK, JNK and p38 cascades, have an essential role in linking cell surface receptors to a variety of cellular processes. In mammalian cells, the ERK pathway is typically activated by growth factors and has a major role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis since expression of constitutively active forms of components of this pathway can transform cells (Kyriakis, 1994; Mansour, 1994; Kyriakis, 1992). Indeed, elevated ERK activation has been associated with several human cancers (Mandell, 1998; Sivaraman et al., 1997; Xing and Imagawa, 1999). On the other hand, it is possible that some tumors may not rely on the ERK pathway for tumorigenesis. Constitutive ERK activation appears to be more common in certain types of cancer such as those of the pancreas, colon, lung, ovary, and kidney, while low frequencies were noted in tumors from the brain, stomach, and liver (Hoshino, 1999). Furthermore, expression of potent oncogenes including Tpr-Met, the EGF variant type III (EGFRvIII), and BCR-ABL in cells have been shown to induce transformation but do not elevate ERK activity (Moscatello, 1996; Raitano et al., 1995; Rodrigues et al., 1997).
The JNK pathway is not consistently activated by growth factors but is more uniformly stimulated by cellular stresses and cytokines (Whitmarsh and Davis, 1996). The evidence that the JNK pathway has a role in tumorigenesis is conflicting. A major physiological role for JNK is to induce apoptosis in various cell types (Abreu-Martin et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1996). It has been shown that the loss of ERK activation coupled with JNK activation promotes cell death (Xia et al., 1995) and MKK4, which phosphorylates JNK, has been implicated as a tumor suppressor gene (Teng, 1997). On the other hand, the prevention of apoptosis and the promotion of cell growth has been shown to be

dependent on JNK in a glioma and a lung tumor cell line (Bost et al., 1997, Bost, 1999; Potapova, 2000a). Transformation by Tpr-Met, EGFRvIII, and BCR-Abl has been linked to JNK activation in fibroblast and leukemic cell lines (Moscatello, 1996; Raitano et al., 1995; Rodrigues et al., 1997). In animal models, the growth of TPA induced papillomas is significantly lower in mice that have a homozygous disruption of JNK2 (Chen, 2001). A limitation is that these studies have been confined to a handful of human tumor cell lines of different origins or animal models. A more consistent pattern regarding the role of JNK in tumorigenesis may emerge if there were a systematic study of one human tumor type.
Human brain tumors frequently show increased expression of the normal EGF receptor and EGFRvIII (Wong et al., 1994). In light of this data, we have investigated the role of JNK in brain tumors. Here we show that JNK has a major role in promoting tumorigenesis. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 86% of primary brain tumors have elevated JNK phosphorylation. Kinase assays revealed that 77% of brain tumor cell lines activated JNK in response to EGF or had high basal activity, whereas none of six normal cell lines analysed, including astrocytes, activated JNK to the same extent or had elevated basal activity. Although expression of a dominant-negative (dn) form

JNK activation in human brain tumors MA Antonyak et al
of JNK appeared to have equivocal effects on cell growth in two glial tumor cell lines, dn JNK inhibited EGF mediated anchorage independent growth and protection from cell death in these cell lines. These findings demonstrate that JNK activation can be upregulated by EGF in brain tumors and that this activation contributes to phenotypes related to transformation.

Results
The activated form of JNK is highly prevalent in brain tumors
To ask whether ERK and/or JNK was relevant to brain tumors, we examined a series of 21 primary glioblastoma multiforme tumors, the most common type of human brain tumor, for levels of expression. Western blot analysis using an anti-JNK antibody revealed varying levels of expression of both the 46 and 54 kDa isoforms of JNK in tumors, but JNK expression in the tumors was overall comparable to levels found in normal human astrocytes (NHAs) (Figure 1, aJNK). The normal brain sample actually showed one of the highest levels of JNK expression, but this is most likely due to the abundance of this MAP kinase in neurons but not in glia in normal brain (Xu et al., 1997). There are nearly equivalent levels of

Figure 1 Frequent activation of JNK in primary human brain tumors. 75 mg of each lysate was resolved by SDS ­ PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. (a) MAP kinase activities were assayed by probing the immunoblots with antibodies that specifically recognize the activated forms of JNK (aActive JNK) or ERK (aActive MAPK). JNK (aJNK) and ERK (aERK) expression levels were determined by re-probing the same blots with antibodies that detect total JNK or ERK expression. The positions of phosphorylated JNK (P-46 or 54kd JNK) and ERK (P-ERK1/2) or total JNK (46 or 54kd JNK) and ERK (ERK2) are indicated with arrows. A normal human astrocyte culture treated without (NHA) or with EGF stimulation (NHA+EGF) and normal brain homogenate (nor.brain) were used as controls. Primary brain tumor lysates are represented by coded sample numbers. (b) Lysates from six tumor samples and normal brain were used in in vitro JNK kinase assays utilizing GST c-jun as the substrate.

ERK2 in all samples except for two tumors, 04 and 18, which showed reduced expression (Figure 1, aERK). Hence, analysis of expression levels of these two proteins was not highly informative.
We then analysed JNK and ERK activities in these primary brain tumors using antibodies that specifically recognize only the phosphorylated, i.e. activated form, of JNK or ERK. Surprisingly, we found increased JNK phosphorylation in 86% (18 of 21) of brain tumors examined (Figure 1, a-Active JNK). While phosphorylation of the 46 kDa isoform could be seen in some tumors, the 54 kDa isoform appeared to be the predominantly active form. JNK activation could be found in the normal brain, but this is likely also due to the constitutive activation of JNK that has been found in neurons (Xu et al., 1997). Another unexpected result was that ERK1 and ERK2 showed potent activation in only two of the brain tumors (51 and 134), moderate levels of ERK phosphorylation in three other tumors (4, 28, and 382), and barely detectable levels in tumors 54, 56, and 31 (Figure 1, aActive MAPK). All other tumors appeared to be negative. To verify that the anti-activated JNK antibody did indeed reflect the activation status of this protein, we also measured JNK activation using an in vitro kinase assay for several representative tumors (Figure 1b,c). The relative levels of activation detected by the kinase assay were consistent with the results obtained with the phospho-antibodies. Thus, despite approximately similar levels of expression of JNK and ERK in brain tumors versus control samples, these data suggested that the JNK pathway may be utilized in a majority of brain tumors to promote tumorigenesis while the ERK pathway is not predominantly used.
EGF induces activation of JNK in tumor cell lines but not normal cell lines
The previous results suggested that further studies on the role of JNK was warranted in these brain tumors. Overexpression of the EGF receptor is commonly found in glioblastoma and EGF stimulation of multiple cell types has been shown to invariably result in ERK activation (Whitmarsh and Davis, 1996). On the other hand, while it has been shown that JNK can be activated by EGF in certain cell lines (Bost et al., 1997; Logan et al., 1997; Minden, 1994a) this is not consistently observed in all cell types (Antonyak et al., 1998; Bost et al., 1997; McClellan et al., 1999). We asked whether the EGF receptor played any role in JNK activation in brain tumor cell lines. Whereas EGF failed to induce JNK activity in two different isolates of NHAs, 7 of 13 brain tumor cell lines showed from a 1.6 to a 4.4-fold activation of JNK in response to EGF and this includes the 1510, 1289, 1728, U87, 706, 442 and 2029 cell lines (Figure 2a, JNK assay and Figure 2b). Various stress stimuli, such as osmotic stress as induced by sorbitol treatment, can strongly activate JNK (Antonyak et al., 1998). Sorbitol treatment resulted in an increase in JNK activity in all cell lines (Figure 2a, JNK Assay) indicating that the JNK pathway was functional in the NHAs. The re-addition

of serum did not activate JNK to the same extent as did EGF in any of the brain tumor lines, indicating that activation of the JNK pathway was relatively specific for this mitogen (Figure 2a, JNK Assay). In addition, 4 of 13 of the tumor cell lines showed elevated basal levels of JNK activity in comparison to control cells, which includes the aforementioned U87 cells and also KNUD, 1265 and 2082 (Figure 2a, JNK assay and Figure 2c). Overall, 77% (10 of 13) cell lines showed abnormal JNK activity relative to control cells. We also examined a different isolate of normal human astrocytes and five other normal cell lineages including normal mammary epithelial, normal ovarian epithelial, normal human foreskin fibroblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblast and Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines and never observed activation of JNK following EGF addition (data not shown). These data suggest that the EGF induced activation of JNK may be a common feature of brain tumor cell lines but is not a property of normal cell lines. We asked whether upregulation of the EGF receptor might account for the JNK activity seen in these tumor lines. As expected, the receptor was activated by EGF in each of the glial and control lines tested (Figure 2a, aActive EGFR). However, the level of receptor autophosphorylation did not correlate with an increase in JNK activation. This finding implies that upregulation of the JNK pathway by EGF in tumor cell lines is likely due to alterations in signaling elements downstream of the EGF receptor.
ERK activation is not obligatorily coupled to EGF receptor activation in tumor cell lines
In addition, we examined the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in these cell lines. Unlike JNK, no brain tumor cell line examined revealed an elevation in the basal activity of either ERK1 or 2, but 77% (10 of 13) of the cell lines did show the expected activation of these MAP kinases in response to EGF or the re-addition of serum (Figure 2a, aActive MAPK and data not shown). Unexpectedly, in three of the tumor cell lines neither EGF nor serum stimulation resulted in a detectable activation of either ERK isoform. Of this group, cell lines U87 and 2082 did show activation of JNK after EGF stimulation, while tumor line 89 showed neither JNK nor ERK activation (Figure 2a, JNK Assay, aActive MAPK, and Figure 2b). In contrast, all control cell lines tested displayed activation of ERK1 and 2 in response to EGF stimulation (Figure 2a, aActive MAPK and data not shown). These results demonstrate that for some tumor cells activation of the EGF receptor does not obligatorily result in the activation of the ERK isoforms of MAP kinase.

The re-addition of serum to brain tumor lines failed to activate JNK to the same extent as EGF (Figure 2a, JNK Assay), implying that sensitization of the JNK

Normal human astrocytes (NHA) or brain tumor lines (listed by sample number) were serum starved and left unstimulated (7) or treated with 0.1 mg EGF (E), complete media (10% serum) (C) or 400 mM sorbitol (S) and then lysed. The JNK activity associated with each cell extract was measured by an in vitro kinase assay (JNK kinase assay), and Western blot analysis of the same lysates was performed to evaluate EGF receptor activation (aActive EGFR) and expression (aEGFR), ERK activation (aActive MAPK) and expression (aERK), and JNK (aJNK) expression.

pathway to this ligand is somewhat specific. To test the ability of other growth factors to upregulate JNK activity, NHAs and glial cell lines 1728 and U87 were stimulated with EGF, IGF-1, insulin, and NGF and the resulting JNK and ERK activities compared. Although all of the growth factors tested increased JNK activity in both tumor lines, the highest level of JNK activation was induced by EGF (Figure 3a, JNK Assay). In contrast, JNK activation in NHAs was significantly enhanced only by osmotic stress.
To further characterize the distinct ability of EGF to regulate the JNK pathway in brain tumor cells, the magnitude and duration of EGF receptor, ERK, and JNK activation was measured for the NHA, 1728, and

U87 cell lines. Stimulation with EGF resulted in a rapid induction of receptor activation that was maximal at 5 min then decreased rapidly in NHAs, but persisted out to 24 h in the glioma cell lines (Figure 3b, aActive EGFR). In contrast, ERK activation was sustained for at least 24 h in NHAs but was rapidly inactivated in 1728 and no activation was detected in the U87 cell line, confirming that even delayed ERK activation does not occur in these cells (Figure 3b, aActive ERK). JNK kinase assays were also performed on the same lysates. Unlike NHAs which did not activate JNK, elevated JNK activity was detectable by 5 min and remained above basal levels for 3 h or longer in both tumor lines (Figure 3b, JNK Assay). Maximal JNK activation was observed

at 5 and 15 min in 1728 and U87 cells, respectively, and it is worth noting that maximal activation occurs earlier than that reported for other cell types (Bost et al., 1997; Hashimoto et al., 1999).

JNK activity contributes to the anchorage independent growth of tumor cells
Having established that there is a link between the EGF receptor and JNK activation in brain tumors, we then asked what aspects of tumorigenesis the JNK pathway might contribute to. We attempted to transfect NHAs and several tumor cell lines with plasmids that encode epitope tagged versions of either wild type (WT) JNK1 or a dominant negative mutant, JNKAPF, or empty vector alone. We were only successful in transfecting and deriving clones expressing these constructs for the 1728 and U87 brain tumor cell lines. We confirmed that these cell lines expressed nearly equal levels of the JNK WT and APF proteins (Figure 4a). Next, we examined JNK activation and found that clones expressing WTJNK had an increase in total JNK activation while the presence of JNKAPF reduced total JNK activity as measured by aActive JNK antibodies, including both the 46 and 54 kDa forms (Figure 4b). We also examined the effect of JNKAPF on transcription in a c-jun reporter assay in U87 cells, which have high basal JNK activity. Using stably transfected control or JNKAPF cell lines, we found that the JNKAPF was indeed capable of strongly repressing the basal c-jun activity in these cells (Figure 4c).
Since JNK can phosphorylate AP-1 factors (Derijard, 1994; Minden, 1994b), which can in turn promote transformation (Smeal et al., 1991), we analysed the ability of these clones to form colonies in soft agar. Both the 1728 and U87 clones transfected with control vector were capable of forming colonies in soft agar (Figure 5a, vector). The overexpression of WTJNK resulted in a significant increase in EGF induced colony formation in 1728 cells (Figure 5a, WTJNK). In contrast, the presence of JNKAPF significantly diminished colony formation and repressed any enhancement by EGF in the 1728 cell line (Figure 5a, JNKAPF). The U87 cell line did not show any significant increase in colony formation after the addition of EGF or by the overexpression of WTJNK, perhaps due to the intrinsically high level of colony formation and because this phenotype may be independent of EGF in this cell line. Nevertheless, the presence of JNKAPF significantly suppressed the number of colonies formed by this cell line. These findings strongly suggest that the JNK pathway is essential for the anchorage independent growth of these glioma cell lines.
JNK has a role in the promotion of cell survival in tumor cells
The activation of JNK has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis for many cell types (Abreu-

JNK activation in human brain tumors MA Antonyak et al
While the control 1728 cells and the cells overexpressing WTJNK had low rates of apoptosis following 1 day of treatment, overexpression of JNKAPF resulted in a sixfold and a threefold increase in the rate of apoptosis induced by serum starvation or cisplatin respectively (Figure 5b, 1728 clones). The presence of JNKAPF diminished the protective effect of EGF against serum deprivation induced apoptosis in this cell line. U87 cells overexpressing vector only or WTJNK were highly resistant to serum deprivation induced cell death (Figure 5b, U87 clones). Expression of JNKAPF in U87 cells did not affect the rate of apoptosis, even after 3 days of serum starvation. However, U87 cells did undergo apoptosis in response to cisplatin. JNKAPF expression sensitized U87 cells to cisplatin, inducing cell death earlier and to a greater extent than in vector only or WTJNK expressing cells (Figure 5b, U87 clones). Therefore, in at least two brain tumor lines, activation of the JNK pathway appears to provide a protective effect from stress or chemotherapeutic induced apoptosis.

Expression levels of these constructs were assayed using anti-FLAG antibody (aFLAG) and the position of the JNK constructs are indicated with arrows (FLAG-JNK constructs). (b) 1728 and U87 cells expressing vector only, WTJNK, or JNKAPF were treated with 400 mM sorbitol and lysed. Immunoblots of the cell extracts were probed with an antibody that recognizes the activated form of JNK. The positions of endogenous JNK phosphorylation (P-46 or 54kd JNK) and exogenous JNK phosphorylation (P-46kd FLAG-JNK) are noted with arrows. (c) pFR-Luc, which has five GAL4 DNA binding sites, was used as a reporter for transcription mediated by the GAL4-cJun fusion protein. U87 control cells (U87 vector) or U87 cells expressing JNKAPF (U87 JNKAPF) were transfected with the indicated plasmids and luciferase activity was measured
Martin et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1996; Xia et al., 1995). We examined directly what role JNK played in apoptosis in the 1728 and U87 cell lines. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was assayed using serum deprivation to induce apoptosis. Since it has been reported that inhibition of the JNK pathway can sensitize cells to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, we also treated cells with this agent (Potapova, 1997).

JNK does not have a consistent role in promoting cell growth
In light of this data and a report that increased JNK activity enhances cell proliferation (Potapova, 2000a), we examined these clones for cell growth in the absence or presence of EGF. The overexpression of WTJNK did not enhance growth in either the U87 or 1728 lines even when EGF was present (Figure 5c). Interestingly, the dn JNK actually appeared to enhance growth in the 1728 cells whereas it had no effect in the U87 cells. Overall, these results do not strongly support a role for JNK in promoting cell growth per se. However, overall our data shows that JNK contributes to other processes associated with tumorigenesis.
Discussion
Numerous studies have established the ERK pathway as a major effector for growth factor receptors in normal and transformed cells (Whitmarsh and Davis, 1996). While these receptors can also stimulate the JNK pathway (Bost et al., 1997; Logan et al., 1997; Minden, 1994a), this activation is minimal in many instances and is not found in all cell types (Antonyak et al., 1998; Bost et al., 1997; McClellan et al., 1999) indicating that growth factor induced responses do not necessarily require the JNK cascade. Moreover, the role of JNK has not been analysed in a large series of primary tumors and cell lines. Our results show that JNK can have a distinct role in the promotion of tumorigenesis. JNK, but not ERK, was found to be highly activated in primary tumors and EGF can upregulate JNK activity in brain tumor cell lines but not in normal cells. Furthermore, this tumor specific activation of JNK was found to contribute to anchorage independent growth and resistance to apoptosis in tumor cells. Recent studies have suggested

Figure 5 JNK promotes anchorage independent growth and prevents cell death in glial tumor cell lines. (a) Anchorage independent growth: The wild type JNK (WTJNK), dominant negative JNK (JNKAPF) or vector only transfected U87 or 1728 cell lines were fed once a week with complete media (CM) or with complete media plus 0.02 mg/ml EGF (CM+EGF), and after 1 month the colonies were counted. Each assay was done in triplicate, averaged, and plotted as a per cent of the control. Open bars represent the percentage of colonies that grew in CM and gray bars represent the percentage of colonies that grew in CM+EGF. The number above each bar indicates the average number of colonies in each condition. (b) Cell survival: The transfected cell lines were seeded on coverslips and either serum starved or treated with cisplatin+0.02 mg EGF for 1 or 3 days. Following the incubation period, cells were stained with DAPI. Cells with condensed nuclei were classified as apoptotic, and the percentage of cell death was determined by calculating the ratio of apoptotic to non-apoptotic cells in each condition. Open bars represent the percentage of cell death in serum free media and gray bars represent the percentage of cell death in serum free media containing EGF. (c) Cell growth: Cells were seeded at 16105 in 6-well dishes and then grown in media containing 0.4% FBS in DMEM without (filled symbols) or with EGF (open symbols).

that JNK can also contribute to tumor cell growth although cell growth properties were not consistently affected in our clones expressing JNKAPF (Bost et al., 1997; Potapova, 2000a,b). Taken together, our data suggests that the JNK pathway is predominantly used for oncogenic progression in glial tumors. These results might also help explain earlier studies that noted enhanced ERK activation occurred at a significantly
Oncogene

lower frequency in brain tumors than in other types of cancers (Hoshino, 1999). It will be interesting to determine if other cancers that lack ERK activation also display elevated JNK activation.
It has been demonstrated that sustained JNK activity coupled with a lack of ERK activity is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Xia et al., 1995). Another surprising finding of this study was the identification of several actively

growing tumor cell lines that displayed constitutive and/ or EGF stimulated JNK activity yet lacked detectable ERK activity. This data suggests that ERK induction is not essential for survival of these cells and, furthermore, activation of the JNK pathway is not associated with the induction of cell death but actually participates in the protection of glial tumor cells from apoptosis. Thus, pathways ordinarily used by normal cells for limiting cell population may actually be subverted by tumors to enhance cell mass.
Inactivation of the PTEN gene may contribute to this resistance to apoptosis via activation of the AKT pathway. The U87 cell line has a mutation of PTEN (Steck, 1997) but examination of the 1728 cell line did not reveal any such alteration so PTEN status does not strictly contribute to the prevention of cell death. It has also been reported that JNK acts to promote cell survival when induced by cell matrix interactions (Almeida, 2000). The fact that these cells were not seeded onto any such cell matrix products indicates that other mechanisms account for cell survival by activation of JNK.
A key feature of MAP kinase signaling modules is the specificity of their activation. The alterations that lead to the increased basal and EGF stimulated JNK activity in the brain tumor lines remains to be resolved. Since sensitization of the JNK pathway does not appear to correlate with aberrant regulation of the EGF receptor itself, other downstream signaling proteins are likely involved. One possibility might involve altered expression or regulation of the Ras related proteins Rac and Cdc42. Both GTPases have been shown to mediate EGF stimulated JNK activity (Coso, 1995; Minden et al., 1995) and have been implicated in transformation (Olson et al., 1995; Qiu et al., 1997).
The high frequency of enhanced JNK activation in brain tumors makes components of the JNK pathway potential targets for cancer therapies (Tan and Kim, 1999). Similar therapeutic strategies that target downregulation of the ERK pathway in tumors with aberrant ERK activity have proven successful at suppressing tumor growth (Sebolt-Leopold, 1999). Given that various cancer types are characterized by elevated ERK and/or JNK activities, our work highlights that treatments that target both of these MAP kinases may provide the greatest therapeutic potential.

All brain tumor derived cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 100 mg/ml kanamycin. The JNK WT and APF constructs were introduced into glial cells 17280 and U87 using a calcium phosphate transfection technique as previously described (Antonyak et al., 1998). Stable transfectants expressing the JNK constructs were selected and maintained in the same base media as parental cells plus 350 mg/ml G418. Normal human astrocytes were cultured in specialized media (Clonetics). All cell lysates were collected as follows: cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 0.5 ml cell lysis buffer (10 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2% NaH3, 0.004% NaF, 1 mM NaVO4, 25 mM b-glycerophosphate, 100 mg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) and centrifuged for clarity. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on either 8.5% acrylamide gels or 4 ­ 20% gradient acrylamide gels. The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked in Blotto (100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat dry milk). The anti-active JNK polyclonal antibody was used at a 1 : 5000 dilution, the anti-phospho-p42/p44 MAPK monoclonal antibody was used at a 1 : 1000 dilution, the antiEGF receptor autophosphorylation site specific polyclonal antibodies were pooled and used at 0.2 mg/ml in Blotto, and the anti-JNK1 (C-17) polyclonal antibody, then antipan-ERK monoclonal antibody, and the anti-Flag (M2) monoclonal antibody were each diluted to 1 mg/ml in Blotto. 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was used to detect the monoclonal antibodies, and 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to detect the polyclonal antibodies. Blots were then exposed to film and/or quantitated on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

Solid-phase c-Jun kinase assay
In vitro c-Jun kinase assays were performed as described previously (Antonyak et al., 1998).

Soft agar analysis
Anchorage independent growth assays are described in detail elsewhere (Antonyak et al., 1998). Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well dishes and fed 1.0 ml of complete media+0.02 mg EGF every week. After 1 month of growth, the colonies were counted.

JNK activation in human brain tumors MA Antonyak et al
Reporter gene assays Plasmid construction and luciferase gene reporter assays were performed as described previously (Okamoto, 2001).

Cell growth assays
Cells were seeded at 16105 cells/well in duplicate and then grown in media containing 0.4% FBS without or with 20 ng/ml EGF. On the indicated days, cells were trypsinized and counted in a Coulter counter.

Assay for apoptosis
Cells were plated on coverslips and grown to near confluence. To induce serum deprived cell death, cells were then incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640+EGF for various lengths of time. Cisplatin induced apoptosis was accomplished by pulsing U87 and 17280 clones with 200 mM or 50 mM cisplatin, respectively, for 1.5 h and then incubating the cells in media with 1% FBS+EGF. The coverslips were then fixed and stained with 2 mg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells were identified by condensed nuclei.
