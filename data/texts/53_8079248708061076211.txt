example shows that limit theorems for empirical measures need not

hold uniformly over a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class of measurable sets,

unless further measurability is assumed.

.1.1. If-V is a P-Donsker class, then there is a probability space (a,3,Pr)
and for n = 1,2, .. there are processes (a,C) + A, (w , C), w E 62, C E V , such
that, for each fixed n, the laws of the pracesses nltZ(P,,-P) and A, are the same and such that

Sections 2, 3 and 4 use the above, but are independent of one another.

2. Universal DaIssker classes are Vspnik-Chervonenkis classes. For any set X let 2X be the collection of all its subsets (power set). Let V c 2X. Then %' is said to shatter a set F c X if '2' = ( F nC : C E ~ )A.lso, V is called a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class if, for some finite n, no set F with n elements is shattered by V .
2.1. THEOREFMor. any set X and collection '3 of subsets of X which is
not a Vapnik-Chervonenkis class, there are a purely atomic probability measure
P on X and a countable collection 3 c %' such that G p is almost surely unbounded on 9.
Proof. Since %' shatters sets- of all sizes, for each- n = 1,2 , ... there is a set F, with 4" elements, shattered by V. Let

G, := F,\ (J F j .

Then the G,, are disjoint and have cardinality

-Let P ((x)) = 6/(z2n2 fn) for each x E En,and let P = 0 outside U En.

Then P is a purely atomic probability measure on X.

Let 9 be a countable subset of V which shatters each of the En.

Let us fix n. Then, for each C E ~ ,

Let ,

Then since sup ( 1 Wp(B)J:B c En) 3 S,/2, we have 8 , E (S, d 4K). For

each x E En, Wp((x)) is a normal random variable with mean O and variance

g: := 6/(n2nZ -2"). Thus

E I Wp((x))l = (2/n)lt26, and var ( I w ~ ( { x ) )=( ) 4: (1-2/n).
Then
E S, = 2" (2/n)'/' G, and var (S,) = (6/(n2n2))(1-2/n),
since 'w, has independent values on disjoint sets. Hence, by Chebyshev's
inequality, for large n we get
Pr (S, < 4 K ) < Pr {IS,-ESnI 2 E S n - 4 K ) < n-'/(4K-E2Q2 < 1/(4~n-2"/' ( 12/n3)1/2)2:= f (n, K ) + 0 as n -, c~

for any fixed K. NOW we consider the event 8 , . Let t t ( n ) : = 22". Enumerate 2En by

By the independence of Wp on disjoint sets, we have

Pr (Dj)= Pr (Mi) Pr {for all C E 9 such that C nEn = BlJ,

Making K large enough, and then n large enough, completes the proof.
It foIIows that if W is a universal Donsker class, i.e. it is a P-Donsker class for all P on the o-algebra d . 1 V, then V is a VapnikChervonenkis class. In [2], Section 7 and Correction, it is shown that every Vapnik-Chervu: nenkis class satisfying some measurability conditions is a universal Donsker class. The remaining problem is to find what measurability conditions are needed. The fofIowing exam.pIe shows that some further measurability is necessary.

2.2. PROPOSITIONT.here exist a set X and a class '3 of countable subsets of X , which shatters no ?-element set, and a probhbility measure P such that almost surely

sup (Pn-P) ( A ) = 1 for all n .
A%

Assuming the continuum hypothesis, rve can take X = LO, 11 and P t o be
Lebesgue measure.
Proof. Let (X, <) be an uncountable well-ordered set such that all its
initial segments (x: x < y ) , y E X , are countable. Let % be the collection
of all these initial segments. Then % does not shatter any set with two elements. Let P be any probabi~itymeasure on X which is 0 on countable
sets and 1 on their complements. Given any finite set ( X I ,..., X,,) c X , there is a se: A in V contair~ingall the Xi,so ( P , - P ) ( A ) = 1, which
completes the >roof.
Steele [3] assumes that all sets in $9 are measurable and that
sup I(P,-P) (A)! is measurable. These conditions are both satisfied in the
A&
exampIe above. Thus it appears that further measurability conditions need to be added to some of the statements and proofs in [3]. -

3. When is 2' P-Donsker for X countable? Let X be a countable set,
say X = (1,2, ...}, and let P be a law on X with P { m } := p,, rn = 1.2, ...

Thus condition (b) in Theorem 1.2 of [2] holds; as the other conditions
also hold for %? = 2X, X countable, it is a P-Donsker class.
On the other hand, if &Ai2 = a,then

by Proposition 6.6 of [I], letting b, :=

4, = lL,,l/pA'2,and recalling

+the relations L ( l A )= Wp( A )= G p(A) P (A)Wp( X ) . Thus Gp has sample

functions almost surely unbounded on 2X (it is enough to consider the

countable collection of finite sets). Consequently, 2' is not a Donsker class,

which completes the proof.

4. A limit theorem for Poisson processes. Let (X,d,p) be a a-finite measure space. Then the Poisson process T, with intensity measure p is indexed by the measurable sets A with p (A) < oo ; T,( A ) is a Poisson variable with parameter p(A), and T, has independent values on disjoint
sets, being additive for (finitely many) disjoint sets. These conditions, as is
known, consistently define a stochastic process. For 0 < p(X) < CO, let T ( X ) = n be a Poisson variable with parameter
p [X).Then let

where the X iare independent and identically distributed with law p/p(X),
and independent of a. It is easily seen that this T is a Poisson process T,. Now let P be a probability measure and 0 < 1< CQ. Then, as R + co,
(G,-AP)/A~/~ converges in law to W,, at Ieast on any finite collection of measurable sets. For +? c -sZ, we say that this convergence in law holds with respect to uni$orm convergence on $7 if there exists a probability space
(a,Pr) carrying a process Wp and processes Sj., 0 < 1< a,such that for

each R the process Si has the same law (as a process on 9?) as (&, -AP)/I~I~an, d such that
-lim sup J(SI W,)(C)I = 0 as.

The following result was proposed by E. 8. Dynkin in a discussion in Oberwolfach, March 1979.

P r o of. Take XI,X,,..., independent with distribution P. For each R,
O < h c oo, Iet n = n(w ,A) be a Poisson variable with parameter 1, inde-

. pendent of the X i . Then we can write TAP = n(w, 1)P n l w , ~(i)n law).

Now (n(w,A) -A)/IL1'2 converges in law to a standard Gaussian variable

as A + CQ. To replace this convergence by almost sure convergence of real

random variables, we use the following standard procedure. For any prob-

ability distribution function P on R and for 0 < y < 1, Iet

F - I (y):= inf {x: F ( x ) 2 y ) .

Suppose laws p,,, on R with distribution functions F , converge to
a law po. Then F i l ( y ) -,~ ; ' ( y ) whenever the interval F i l ( y ) contains at most one point. Thus FG1(y) -,Fgl(y) for all y, 0 < y < 1, if F, has an everywhere positive density, e.g. if it is a nondegenerate normal distribution function. Thus if p1 + p, as A 7, a,where pA has distribution. function F A and p, has an everywhere strictly positive density, then, for 0 < y < 1 , FT1(y) -,F i l (y) as 1+ m (continuously).
Now, taking a new probability space if necessary, we may assume that, for all o,

where H is a standard normal variable. Also, by 1.1, we can take nl/'(P,-Pj := v, 4 Gp uniformly on %?almost surely as n -r a , where the n(o,A) and H are independent of P, and G,.
Now (n(o, A)-R)/1 -,0 as., so n(w, A)/A 4 1 as. and n(w, A) + CQ a.s. Thus v,,(,,~, Gp uniformly on %? almost surely. So

uniformly on % almost surety as A + a , which completes the proof.
