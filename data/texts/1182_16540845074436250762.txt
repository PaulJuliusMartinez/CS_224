The Next Stage of the Known, Or a Completely New Paradigm? Taiichi Sakaiya--The Knowledge-Value Revolution
The Software Developer's Burden Imagine you're a software application developer. Your programming language of choice (or the language that's been foisted on you) is C or C++. You've been at this for quite a while and your job doesn't seem to be getting any easier. These past few years you've seen the growth of multiple incompatible hardware architectures, each supporting multiple incompatible operating systems, with each platform operating with one or more incompatible graphical user interfaces. Now you're supposed to cope with all this and make your applications work in a distributed client-server environment. The growth of the Internet, the World-Wide Web, and "electronic commerce" have introduced new dimensions of complexity into the development process.

The tools you use to develop applications don't seem to help you much. You're still coping with the same old problems; the fashionable new object-oriented techniques seem to have added new problems without solving the old ones. You say to yourself and your friends, "There has to be a better way"!
The Better Way is Here Now Now there is a better way--it's the JavaTM programming language platform ("Java" for short) from Sun Microsystems. Imagine, if you will, this development world...
 Your programming language is object oriented, yet it's still dead simple.  Your development cycle is much faster because Java is interpreted. The
compile-link-load-test-crash-debug cycle is obsolete--now you just compile and run.
 Your applications are portable across multiple platforms. Write your
applications once, and you never need to port them--they will run without modification on multiple operating systems and hardware architectures.
 Your applications are robust because the Java run-time system manages
memory for you.
 Your interactive graphical applications have high performance because
multiple concurrent threads of activity in your application are supported by the multithreading built into the Java language and runtime platform.
 Your applications are adaptable to changing environments because you can
dynamically download code modules from anywhere on the network.
 Your end users can trust that your applications are secure, even though
they're downloading code from all over the Internet; the Java run-time system has built-in protection against viruses and tampering.
You don't need to dream about these features. They're here now. The Java Programming Language platform provides a portable, interpreted, highperformance, simple, object-oriented programming language and supporting runtime environment. This introductory chapter provides you with a brief look at the main design goals of the Java system; the remainder of this paper examines the features of Java in more detail.

The last chapter of this paper describes the HotJavaTM Browser ("HotJava" for short). HotJava is an innovative World-Wide Web browser, and the first major applications written using the Java platform. HotJava is the first browser to dynamically download and execute Java code fragments from anywhere on the Internet, and can do so in a secure manner.
1.1 Beginnings of the Java Language Project
Java is designed to meet the challenges of application development in the context of heterogeneous, network-wide distributed environments. Paramount among these challenges is secure delivery of applications that consume the minimum of system resources, can run on any hardware and software platform, and can be extended dynamically.
Java originated as part of a research project to develop advanced software for a wide variety of network devices and embedded systems. The goal was to develop a small, reliable, portable, distributed, real-time operating platform. When the project started, C++ was the language of choice. But over time the difficulties encountered with C++ grew to the point where the problems could best be addressed by creating an entirely new language platform. Design and architecture decisions drew from a variety of languages such as Eiffel, SmallTalk, Objective C, and Cedar/Mesa. The result is a language platform that has proven ideal for developing secure, distributed, network-based enduser applications in environments ranging from network-embedded devices to the World-Wide Web and the desktop.
1.2 Design Goals of Java
The design requirements of Java are driven by the nature of the computing environments in which software must be deployed.
The massive growth of the Internet and the World-Wide Web leads us to a completely new way of looking at development and distribution of software. To live in the world of electronic commerce and distribution, Java must enable the development of secure, high performance, and highly robust applications on multiple platforms in heterogeneous, distributed networks.

Introduction to Java

1
Operating on multiple platforms in heterogeneous networks invalidates the traditional schemes of binary distribution, release, upgrade, patch, and so on. To survive in this jungle, Java must be architecture neutral, portable, and dynamically adaptable.
The Java system that emerged to meet these needs is simple, so it can be easily programmed by most developers; familiar, so that current developers can easily learn Java; object oriented, to take advantage of modern software development methodologies and to fit into distributed client-server applications; multithreaded, for high performance in applications that need to perform multiple concurrent activities, such as multimedia; and interpreted, for maximum portability and dynamic capabilities.
Together, the above requirements comprise quite a collection of buzzwords, so let's examine some of them and their respective benefits before going on.
1.2.1 Simple, Object Oriented, and Familiar
Primary characteristics of Java include a simple language that can be programmed without extensive programmer training while being attuned to current software practices. The fundamental concepts of Java are grasped quickly; programmers can be productive from the very beginning.
Java is designed to be object oriented from the ground up. Object technology has finally found its way into the programming mainstream after a gestation period of thirty years. The needs of distributed, client-server based systems coincide with the encapsulated, message-passing paradigms of object-based software. To function within increasingly complex, network-based environments, programming systems must adopt object-oriented concepts. Java provides a clean and efficient object-based development platform.
Programmers using Java can access existing libraries of tested objects that provide functionality ranging from basic data types through I/O and network interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits. These libraries can be extended to provide new behavior.
Even though C++ was rejected as an implementation language, keeping Java looking like C++ as far as possible results in Java being a familiar language, while removing the unnecessary complexities of C++. Having Java retain many of the object-oriented features and the "look and feel" of C++ means that programmers can migrate easily to Java and be productive quickly.

1.2.2 Robust and Secure
Java is designed for creating highly reliable software. It provides extensive compile-time checking, followed by a second level of run-time checking. Language features guide programmers towards reliable programming habits.
The memory management model is extremely simple: objects are created with a new operator. There are no explicit programmer-defined pointer data types, no pointer arithmetic, and automatic garbage collection. This simple memory management model eliminates entire classes of programming errors that bedevil C and C++ programmers. You can develop Java language code with confidence that the system will find many errors quickly and that major problems won't lay dormant until after your production code has shipped.
Java is designed to operate in distributed environments, which means that security is of paramount importance. With security features designed into the language and run-time system, Java lets you construct applications that can't be invaded from outside. In the network environment, applications written in Java are secure from intrusion by unauthorized code attempting to get behind the scenes and create viruses or invade file systems.
1.2.3 Architecture Neutral and Portable
Java is designed to support applications that will be deployed into heterogeneous network environments. In such environments, applications must be capable of executing on a variety of hardware architectures. Within this variety of hardware platforms, applications must execute atop a variety of operating systems and interoperate with multiple programming language interfaces. To accommodate the diversity of operating environments, the Java compiler generates bytecodes--an architecture neutral intermediate format designed to transport code efficiently to multiple hardware and software platforms. The interpreted nature of Java solves both the binary distribution problem and the version problem; the same Java language byte codes will run on any platform.
Architecture neutrality is just one part of a truly portable system. Java takes portability a stage further by being strict in its definition of the basic language. Java puts a stake in the ground and specifies the sizes of its basic data types and the behavior of its arithmetic operators. Your programs are the same on every platform--there are no data type incompatibilities across hardware and software architectures.

The architecture-neutral and portable language platform of Java is known as the Java Virtual Machine. It's the specification of an abstract machine for which Java language compilers can generate code. Specific implementations of the Java Virtual Machine for specific hardware and software platforms then provide the concrete realization of the virtual machine. The Java Virtual Machine is based primarily on the POSIX interface specification--an industrystandard definition of a portable system interface. Implementing the Java Virtual Machine on new architectures is a relatively straightforward task as long as the target platform meets basic requirements such as support for multithreading.
1.2.4 High Performance
Performance is always a consideration. Java achieves superior performance by adopting a scheme by which the interpreter can run at full speed without needing to check the run-time environment. The automatic garbage collector runs as a low-priority background thread, ensuring a high probability that memory is available when required, leading to better performance. Applications requiring large amounts of compute power can be designed such that compute-intensive sections can be rewritten in native machine code as required and interfaced with the Java platform. In general, users perceive that interactive applications respond quickly even though they're interpreted.
1.2.5 Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic
The Java interpreter can execute Java bytecodes directly on any machine to which the interpreter and run-time system have been ported. In an interpreted platform such as Java system, the link phase of a program is simple, incremental, and lightweight. You benefit from much faster development cycles--prototyping, experimentation, and rapid development are the normal case, versus the traditional heavyweight compile, link, and test cycles.
Modern network-based applications, such as the HotJava World-Wide Web browser, typically need to do several things at the same time. A user working with HotJava can run several animations concurrently while downloading an image and scrolling the page. Java's multithreading capability provides the means to build applications with many concurrent threads of activity. Multithreading thus results in a high degree of interactivity for the end user.
15 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

1
Java supports multithreading at the language level with the addition of sophisticated synchronization primitives: the language library provides the Thread class, and the run-time system provides monitor and condition lock primitives. At the library level, moreover, Java's high-level system libraries have been written to be thread safe: the functionality provided by the libraries is available without conflict to multiple concurrent threads of execution.
While the Java compiler is strict in its compile-time static checking, the language and run-time system are dynamic in their linking stages. Classes are linked only as needed. New code modules can be linked in on demand from a variety of sources, even from sources across a network. In the case of the HotJava browser and similar applications, interactive executable code can be loaded from anywhere, which enables transparent updating of applications. The result is on-line services that constantly evolve; they can remain innovative and fresh, draw more customers, and spur the growth of electronic commerce on the Internet.
1.3 The Java Platform--a New Approach to Distributed Computing
Taken individually, the characteristics discussed above can be found in a variety of software development platforms. What's completely new is the manner in which Java and its run-time system have combined them to produce a flexible and powerful programming system.
Developing your applications using Java results in software that is portable across multiple machine architectures, operating systems, and graphical user interfaces, secure, and high performance. With Java, your job as a software developer is much easier--you focus your full attention on the end goal of shipping innovative products on time, based on the solid foundation of Java. The better way to develop software is here, now, brought to you by the Java language platform.

You know you've achieved perfection in design, Not when you have nothing more to add,
But when you have nothing more to take away.
Antoine de Saint Exupery.

In his science-fiction novel, The Rolling Stones, Robert A. Heinlein comments:
Every technology goes through three stages: first a crudely simple and quite unsatisfactory gadget; second, an enormously complicated group of gadgets designed to overcome the shortcomings of the original and achieving thereby somewhat satisfactory performance through extremely complex compromise; third, a final proper design therefrom.
Heinlein's comment could well describe the evolution of many programming languages. Java presents a new viewpoint in the evolution of programming languages--creation of a small and simple language that's still sufficiently comprehensive to address a wide variety of software application development. Although Java is superficially similar to C and C++, Java gained its simplicity from the systematic removal of features from its predecessors. This chapter discusses two of the primary design features of Java, namely, it's simple (from removing features) and familiar (because it looks like C and C++). The next

18

2
19

chapter discusses Java's object-oriented features in more detail. At the end of this chapter you'll find a discussion on features eliminated from C and C++ in the evolution of Java.
Design Goals Simplicity is one of Java's overriding design goals. Simplicity and removal of many "features" of dubious worth from its C and C++ ancestors keep Java relatively small and reduce the programmer's burden in producing reliable applications. To this end, Java design team examined many aspects of the "modern" C and C++ languages* to determine features that could be eliminated in the context of modern object-oriented programming.
Another major design goal is that Java look familiar to a majority of programmers in the personal computer and workstation arenas, where a large fraction of system programmers and application programmers are familiar with C and C++. Thus, Java "looks like" C++. Programmers familiar with C, Objective C, C++, Eiffel, Ada, and related languages should find their Java language learning curve quite short--on the order of a couple of weeks.
To illustrate the simple and familiar aspects of Java, we follow the tradition of a long line of illustrious programming books by showing you the HelloWorld program. It's about the simplest program you can write that actually does something. Here's HelloWorld implemented in Java.
class HelloWorld { static public void main(String args[]) { System.out.println("Hello world!"); }
}
This example declares a class named HelloWorld. Classes are discussed in the next chapter on object-oriented programming, but in general we assume the reader is familiar with object technology and understands the basics of classes, objects, instance variables, and methods.
Within the HelloWorld class, we declare a single method called main() which in turn contains a single method invocation to display the string "Hello world!" on the standard output. The statement that prints "Hello world!" does so by

invoking the println method of the out object. The out object is a class variable in the System class that performs output operations on files. That's all there is to HelloWorld.
2.1 Main Features of the Java Language
Java follows C++ to some degree, which carries the benefit of it being familiar to many programmers. This section describes the essential features of Java and points out where the language diverges from its ancestors C and C++.
2.1.1 Primitive Data Types
Other than the primitive data types discussed here, everything in Java is an object. Even the primitive data types can be encapsulated inside librarysupplied objects if required. Java follows C and C++ fairly closely in its set of basic data types, with a couple of minor exceptions. There are only three groups of primitive data types, namely, numeric types, Boolean types, and arrays.
Numeric Data Types Integer numeric types are 8-bit byte, 16-bit short, 32-bit int, and 64-bit long. The 8-bit byte data type in Java has replaced the old C and C++ char data type. Java places a different interpretation on the char data type, as discussed below.
There is no unsigned type specifier for integer data types in Java.
Real numeric types are 32-bit float and 64-bit double. Real numeric types and their arithmetic operations are as defined by the IEEE 754 specification. A floating point literal value, like 23.79, is considered double by default; you must explicitly cast it to float if you wish to assign it to a float variable.
Character Data Types Java language character data is a departure from traditional C. Java's char data type defines a sixteen-bit Unicode character. Unicode characters are unsigned 16-bit values that define character codes in the range 0 through 65,535. If you write a declaration such as
char myChar = `Q';

Java--Simple and Familiar

20

2
you get a Unicode (16-bit unsigned value) type initialized to the Unicode value of the character Q. By adopting the Unicode character set standard for its character data type, Java language applications are amenable to internationalization and localization, greatly expanding the market for worldwide applications.
Boolean Data Types Java added a Boolean data type as a primitive type, tacitly ratifying existing C and C++ programming practice, where developers define keywords for TRUE and FALSE or YES and NO or similar constructs. A Java boolean variable assumes the value true or false. A Java boolean is a distinct data type; unlike common C practice, a Java boolean type can't be converted to any numeric type.
2.1.2 Arithmetic and Relational Operators
All the familiar C and C++ operators apply. Java has no unsigned data types, so the >>> operator has been added to the language to indicate an unsigned (logical) right shift. Java also uses the + operator for string concatenation; concatenation is covered below in the discussion on strings.
2.1.3 Arrays
In contrast to C and C++, Java language arrays are first-class language objects. An array in Java is a real object with a run-time representation. You can declare and allocate arrays of any type, and you can allocate arrays of arrays to obtain multi-dimensional arrays. You declare an array of, say, Points (a class you've declared elsewhere) with a declaration like this:
Point myPoints[]; This code states that myPoints is an uninitialized array of Points. At this time, the only storage allocated for myPoints is a reference handle. At some future time you must allocate the amount of storage you need, as in:
myPoints = new Point[10];
21 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

2

to allocate an array of ten references to Points that are initialized to the null reference. Notice that this allocation of an array doesn't actually allocate any objects of the Point class for you; you will have to also allocate the Point objects, something like this:
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { myPoints[i] = new Point();
}
Access to elements of myPoints can be performed via normal C-style indexing, but all array accesses are checked to ensure that their indices are within the range of the array. An exception is generated if the index is outside the bounds of the array.
The length of an array is stored in the length instance variable of the specific array: myPoints.length contains the number of elements in myPoints. For instance, the code fragment:
howMany = myPoints.length;
would assign the value 10 to the howMany variable.
The C notion of a pointer to an array of memory elements is gone, and with it, the arbitrary pointer arithmetic that leads to unreliable code in C. No longer can you walk off the end of an array, possibly trashing memory and leading to the famous "delayed-crash" syndrome, where a memory-access violation today manifests itself hours or days later. Programmers can be confident that array checking in Java will lead to more robust and reliable code.
2.1.4 Strings
Strings are Java language objects, not pseudo-arrays of characters as in C. There are actually two kinds of string objects: the String class is for read-only (immutable) objects. The StringBuffer class is for string objects you wish to modify (mutable string objects).
Although strings are Java language objects, Java compiler follows the C tradition of providing a syntactic convenience that C programmers have enjoyed with C-style strings, namely, the Java compiler understands that a string of characters enclosed in double quote signs is to be instantiated as a String object. Thus, the declaration:
String hello = "Hello world!";

Java--Simple and Familiar

22

2

instantiates an object of the String class behind the scenes and initializes it with a character string containing the Unicode character representation of "Hello world!".
Java has extended the meaning of the + operator to indicate string concatenation. Thus you can write statements like:
System.out.println("There are " + num + " characters in the file.");
This code fragment concatenates the string "There are " with the result of converting the numeric value num to a string, and concatenates that with the string " characters in the file.". Then it prints the result of those concatenations on the standard output.
String objects provide a length() accessor method to obtain the number of characters in the string.

2.1.5 Multi-Level Break
Java has no goto statement. To break or continue multiple-nested loop or switch constructs, you can place labels on loop and switch constructs, and then break out of or continue to the block named by the label. Here's a small fragment of code from Java's built-in String class:

test:

for (int i = fromIndex; i + max1 <= max2; i++) { if (charAt(i) == c0) { for (int k = 1; k<max1; k++) { if (charAt(i+k) != str.charAt(k)) { continue test; } } /* end of inner for loop */ }
} /* end of outer for loop */

The continue test statement is inside a for loop nested inside another for loop. By referencing the label test, the continue statement passes control to the outer for statement. In traditional C, continue statements can only continue the immediately enclosing block; to continue or exit outer blocks, programmers have traditionally either used auxiliary Boolean variables whose only purpose is to determine if the outer block is to be continued or exited;

23 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

2

alternatively, programmers have (mis)used the goto statement to exit out of nested blocks. Use of labelled blocks in Java leads to considerable simplification in programming effort and a major reduction in maintenance.
The notion of labelled blocks dates back to the mid-1970s, but it hasn't caught on to any large extent in modern programming languages. Perl is another modern programming language that implements the concept of labelled blocks. Perl's next label and last label are equivalent to continue label and break label statements in Java.
2.1.6 Memory Management and Garbage Collection
C and C++ programmers are by now accustomed to the problems of explicitly managing memory: allocating memory, freeing memory, and keeping track of what memory can be freed when. Explicit memory management has proved to be a fruitful source of bugs, crashes, memory leaks, and poor performance.
Java completely removes the memory management load from the programmer. C-style pointers, pointer arithmetic, malloc, and free do not exist. Automatic garbage collection is an integral part of Java and its run-time system. While Java has a new operator to allocate memory for objects, there is no explicit free function. Once you have allocated an object, the run-time system keeps track of the object's status and automatically reclaims memory when objects are no longer in use, freeing memory for future use.
Java's memory management model is based on objects and references to objects. Java has no pointers. Instead, all references to allocated storage, which in practice means all references to an object, are through symbolic "handles". The Java memory manager keeps track of references to objects. When an object has no more references, the object is a candidate for garbage collection.
Java's memory allocation model and automatic garbage collection make your programming task easier, eliminate entire classes of bugs, and in general provide better performance than you'd obtain through explicit memory management. Here's a code fragment that illustrates when garbage collection happens:
class ReverseString { public static String reverseIt(String source) { int i, len = source.length(); StringBuffer dest = new StringBuffer(len);
for (i = (len - 1); i >= 0; i--) {

Java--Simple and Familiar

24

2
dest.appendChar(source.charAt(i)); } return dest.toString(); } }
The variable dest is used as a temporary object reference during execution of the reverseIt method. When dest goes out of scope (the reverseIt method returns), the reference to that object has gone away and it's then a candidate for garbage collection.
2.1.7 The Background Garbage Collector
The Java garbage collector achieves high performance by taking advantage of the nature of a user's behavior when interacting with software applications such as the HotJava browser. The typical user of the typical interactive application has many natural pauses where they're contemplating the scene in front of them or thinking of what to do next. The Java run-time system takes advantage of these idle periods and runs the garbage collector in a low priority thread when no other threads are competing for CPU cycles. The garbage collector gathers and compacts unused memory, increasing the probability that adequate memory resources are available when needed during periods of heavy interactive use.
This use of a thread to run the garbage collector is just one of many examples of the synergy one obtains from Java's integrated multithreading capabilities--an otherwise intractable problem is solved in a simple and elegant fashion.
2.1.8 Integrated Thread Synchronization
Java supports multithreading, both at the language (syntactic) level and via support from its run-time system and thread objects. While other systems have provided facilities for multithreading (usually via "lightweight process" libraries), building multithreading support into the language itself provides the programmer with a much easier and more powerful tool for easily creating thread-safe multithreaded classes. Multithreading is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.

2.2 Features Removed from C and C++
The earlier part of this chapter concentrated on the principal features of Java. This section discusses features removed from C and C++ in the evolution of Java.
The first step was to eliminate redundancy from C and C++. In many ways, the C language evolved into a collection of overlapping features, providing too many ways to say the same thing, while in many cases not providing needed features. C++, in an attempt to add "classes in C", merely added more redundancy while retaining many of the inherent problems of C.
2.2.1 No More Typedefs, Defines, or Preprocessor
Source code written in Java is simple. There is no preprocessor, no #define and related capabilities, no typedef, and absent those features, no longer any need for header files. Instead of header files, Java language source files provide the declarations of other classes and their methods.
A major problem with C and C++ is the amount of context you need to understand another programmer's code: you have to read all related header files, all related #defines, and all related typedefs before you can even begin to analyze a program. In essence, programming with #defines and typedefs results in every programmer inventing a new programming language that's incomprehensible to anybody other than its creator, thus defeating the goals of good programming practices.
In Java, you obtain the effects of #define by using constants. You obtain the effects of typedef by declaring classes--after all, a class effectively declares a new type. You don't need header files because the Java compiler compiles class definitions into a binary form that retains all the type information through to link time.
By removing all this baggage, Java becomes remarkably context-free. Programmers can read and understand code and, more importantly, modify and reuse code much faster and easier.

Java--Simple and Familiar

26

2
2.2.2 No More Structures or Unions
Java has no structures or unions as complex data types. You don't need structures and unions when you have classes; you can achieve the same effect simply by declaring a class with the appropriate instance variables.
The code fragment below declares a class called Point. class Point extends Object { double x; double y; // methods to access the instance variables }
The following code fragment declares a class called Rectangle, that uses objects of the Point class as instance variables.
class Rectangle extends Object { Point lowerLeft; Point upperRight; // methods to access the instance variables
}
In C you'd define these classes as structures. In Java, you simply declare classes. You can make the instance variables as private or as public as you wish, depending on how much you wish to hide the details of the implementation from other objects.
2.2.3 No Enums
Java has no enum types. You can obtain something similar to enum by declaring a class whose only raison d'etre is to hold constants. You could use this feature something like this:
class Direction extends Object { public static final int North = 1; public static final int South = 2; public static final int East = 3; public static final int West = 4;
}
You can now refer to, say, the South constant using the notation Direction.South.
27 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

2

Using classes to contain constants in this way provides a major advantage over C's enum types. In C (and C++), names defined in enums must be unique: if you have an enum called HotColors containing names Red and Yellow, you can't use those names in any other enum. You couldn't, for instance, define another Enum called TrafficLightColors also containing Red and Yellow.

Using the class-to-contain-constants technique in Java, you can use the same names in different classes, because those names are qualified by the name of the containing class. From our example just above, you might wish to create another class called CompassRose:

class CompassRose extends Object {

public static final int North

= 1;

public static final int NorthEast = 2;

public static final int East

= 3;

public static final int SouthEast = 4;

public static final int South

= 5;

public static final int SouthWest = 6;

public static final int West

= 7;

public static final int NorthWest = 8;

}

There is no ambiguity because the name of the containing class acts as a qualifier for the constants. In the second example, you would use the notation CompassRose.NorthWest to access the corresponding value. Java effectively provides you the concept of qualified enums, all within the existing class mechanisms.

2.2.4 No More Functions
Java has no functions. Object-oriented programming supersedes functional and procedural styles. Mixing the two styles just leads to confusion and dilutes the purity of an object-oriented language. Anything you can do with a function you can do just as well by defining a class and creating methods for that class. Consider the Point class from above. We've added public methods to set and access the instance variables:
class Point extends Object { double x; double y;
public void setX(double x) { this.x = x;
}

Java--Simple and Familiar

28

2
public void setY(double y) { this.y = y;
} public double x() {
return x; } public double y() {
return y; } }
If the x and y instance variables are private to this class, the only means to access them is via the public methods of the class. Here's how you'd use objects of the Point class from within, say, an object of the Rectangle class:
class Rectangle extends Object { Point lowerLeft; Point upperRight;
public void setEmptyRect() { lowerLeft.setX(0.0); lowerLeft.setY(0.0); upperRight.setX(0.0); upperRight.setY(0.0);
} }
It's not to say that functions and procedures are inherently wrong. But given classes and methods, we're now down to only one way to express a given task. By eliminating functions, your job as a programmer is immensely simplified: you work only with classes and their methods.
2.2.5 No More Multiple Inheritance
Multiple inheritance--and all the problems it generates--was discarded from Java. The desirable features of multiple inheritance are provided by interfaces--conceptually similar to Objective C protocols.
An interface is not a definition of a class. Rather, it's a definition of a set of methods that one or more classes will implement. An important issue of interfaces is that they declare only methods and constants. Variables may not be defined in interfaces.
29 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

2
2.2.6 No More Goto Statements
Java has no goto statement*. Studies illustrated that goto is (mis)used more often than not simply "because it's there". Eliminating goto led to a simplification of the language--there are no rules about the effects of a goto into the middle of a for statement, for example. Studies on approximately 100,000 lines of C code determined that roughly 90 percent of the goto statements were used purely to obtain the effect of breaking out of nested loops. As mentioned above, multi-level break and continue remove most of the need for goto statements.
2.2.7 No More Operator Overloading
There are no means provided by which programmers can overload the standard arithmetic operators. Once again, the effects of operator overloading can be just as easily achieved by declaring a class, appropriate instance variables, and appropriate methods to manipulate those variables. Eliminating operator overloading leads to great simplification of code.
2.2.8 No More Automatic Coercions
Java prohibits C and C++ style automatic coercions. If you wish to coerce a data element of one type to a data type that would result in loss of precision, you must do so explicitly by using a cast. Consider this code fragment:
int myInt; double myFloat = 3.14159; myInt = myFloat;
The assignment of myFloat to myInt would result in a compiler error indicating a possible loss of precision and that you must use an explicit cast. Thus, you should re-write the code fragments as:
int myInt; double myFloat = 3.14159; myInt = (int)myFloat;

* However, goto is still a reserved word.
Java--Simple and Familiar

30

2

2.2.9 No More Pointers
Most studies agree that pointers are one of the primary features that enable programmers to inject bugs into their code. Given that structures are gone, and arrays and strings are objects, the need for pointers to these constructs goes away. Thus, Java has no pointer data types. Any task that would require arrays, structures, and pointers in C can be more easily and reliably performed by declaring objects and arrays of objects. Instead of complex pointer manipulation on array pointers, you access arrays by their arithmetic indices. The Java run-time system checks all array indexing to ensure indices are within the bounds of the array.
You no longer have dangling pointers and trashing of memory because of incorrect pointers, because there are no pointers in Java.

2.3 Summary

To sum up this chapter, Java is:
 Simple--the number of language constructs you need to understand to get
your job done is minimal.
 Familiar--Java looks like C and C++ while discarding the overwhelming
complexities of those languages.
Now that you've seen how Java was simplified by removal of features from its predecessors, read the next chapter for a discussion on the object-oriented features of Java.

Java is Object Oriented

My Object All Sublime I Will Achieve in Time
Gilbert and Sullivan--The Mikado
To stay abreast of modern software development practices, Java is object oriented from the ground up. The point of designing an object-oriented language is not simply to jump on the latest programming fad. The objectoriented paradigm meshes well with the needs of client-server and distributed software. Benefits of object technology are rapidly becoming realized as more organizations move their applications to the distributed client-server model.
Unfortunately, "object oriented" remains misunderstood, over-marketed as the silver bullet that will solve all our software ills, or takes on the trappings of a religion. The cynic's view of object-oriented programming is that it's just a new way to organize your source code. While there may be some merit to this view, it doesn't tell the whole story, because you can achieve results with objectoriented programming techniques that you can't with procedural techniques.
An important characteristic that distinguishes objects from ordinary procedures or functions is that an object can have a lifetime greater than that of the object that created it. This aspect of objects is subtle and mostly overlooked.
32

3
In the distributed client-server world, you now have the potential for objects to be created in one place, passed around networks, and stored elsewhere, possibly in databases, to be retrieved for future work.
As an object-oriented language, Java draws on the best concepts and features of previous object-oriented languages, primarily Eiffel, SmallTalk, Objective C, and C++. Java goes beyond C++ in both extending the object model and removing the major complexities of C++. With the exception of its primitive data types, everything in Java is an object, and even the primitive types can be encapsulated within objects if the need arises.
3.1 Object Technology in Java
To be truly considered "object oriented", a programming language should support at a minimum four characteristics:
 Encapsulation--implements information hiding and modularity (abstraction)  Polymorphism--the same message sent to different objects results in behavior
that's dependent on the nature of the object receiving the message
 Inheritance--you define new classes and behavior based on existing classes
to obtain code re-use and code organization
 Dynamic binding--objects could come from anywhere, possibly across the
network. You need to be able to send messages to objects without having to know their specific type at the time you write your code. Dynamic binding provides maximum flexibility while a program is executing
Java meets these requirements nicely, and adds considerable run-time support to make your software development job easier.
3.2 What Are Objects?
At its simplest, object technology is a collection of analysis, design, and programming methodologies that focuses design on modelling the characteristics and behavior of objects in the real world. True, this definition appears to be somewhat circular, so let's try to break out into clear air.
What are objects? They're software programming models. In your everyday life, you're surrounded by objects: cars, coffee machines, ducks, trees, and so on. Software applications contain objects: buttons on user interfaces, spreadsheets
33 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3

and spreadsheet cells, property lists, menus, and so on. These objects have state and behavior. You can represent all these things with software constructs called objects, which can also be defined by their state and their behavior.
In your everyday transportation needs, a car can be modelled by an object. A car has state (how fast it's going, in which direction, its fuel consumption, and so on) and behavior (starts, stops, turns, slides, and runs into trees).
You drive your car to your office, where you track your stock portfolio. In your daily interactions with the stock markets, a stock can be modelled by an object. A stock has state (daily high, daily low, open price, close price, earnings per share, relative strength), and behavior (changes value, performs splits, has dividends).
After watching your stock decline in price, you repair to the cafe to console yourself with a cup of good hot coffee. The espresso machine can be modelled as an object. It has state (water temperature, amount of coffee in the hopper) and it has behavior (emits steam, makes noise, and brews a perfect cup of java).

3.3 Basics of Objects

Method

An object's behavior is defined by its methods. Methods manipulate the instance variables to create new state; an object's methods can also create new objects.
The small picture to the left is a commonly used graphical representation of an object. The diagram illustrates the conceptual structure of a software object--it's kind of like a cell, with an outer membrane that's its interface to the world, and an inner nucleus that's protected by the outer membrane.
An object's instance variables (data) are packaged, or encapsulated, within the object. The instance variables are surrounded by the object's methods. With certain well-defined exceptions, the object's methods are the only means by

Java is Object Oriented

34

3

which other objects can access or alter its instance variables. In Java, classes can declare their instance variables to be public, in which cases the instance variables are globally accessible to other objects. Declarations of accessibility are covered later in Access Specifiers. Later on you will also find a discussion on class variables and class methods.

3.3.1 Classes

A class is a software construct that defines the data (state) and methods (behavior) of the specific concrete objects that are subsequently constructed from that class. In Java terminology, a class is built out of members, which are either fields or methods. Fields are the data for the class. Methods are the sequences of statements that operate on the data. Fields are normally specific to an object--that is, every object constructed from the class definition will have its own copy of the field. Such fields are known as instance variables. Similarly, methods are also normally declared to operate on the instance variables of the class, and are thus known as instance methods.

A class in and of itself is not an object. A class is like a blueprint that defines how an object will look and behave when the object is created or instantiated from the specification declared by the class. You obtain concrete objects by instantiating a previously defined class. You can instantiate many objects from one class definition, just as you can construct many houses all the same* from a single architect's drawing. Here's the basic declaration of a very simple class called Point

class Point extends Object { public double x; /* instance variable public double y; /* instance variable
}

*/ */

As mentioned, this declaration merely defines a template from which real objects can be instantiated, as described next.

* Like those "Little Boxes".
35 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3

3.3.2 Instantiating an Object from its Class

Having declared the size and shape of the Point class above, any other object can now create a Point object--an instance of the Point class--with a fragment of code like this:

Point myPoint;

// declares a variable to refer to a Point object

myPoint = new Point(); // allocates an instance of a Point object
Now, you can access the variables of this Point object by referring to the names of the variables, qualified with the name of the object:
myPoint.x = 10.0; myPoint.y = 25.7;
This referencing scheme, similar to a C structure reference, works because the instance variables of Point were declared public in the class declaration. Had the instance variables not been declared public, objects outside of the package within which Point was declared could not access its instance variables in this direct manner. The Point class declaration would then need to provide accessor methods to set and get its variables. This topic is discussed in a little more detail after this discussion on constructors.

3.3.3 Constructors

When you declare a class in Java, you can declare optional constructors that perform initialization when you instantiate objects from that class. You can also declare an optional finalizer, discussed later. Let's go back to our Point class from before:
class Point extends Object { public double x; /* instance variable */ public double y; /* instance variable */

Point() {

/* constructor to initialize to default zero value */

x = 0.0;

y = 0.0;

}

/* constructor to initialize to specific value */

Point(double x, double y) {

this.x = x; /* set instance variables to passed parameters */

this.y = y;

}

}

Java is Object Oriented

36

3
37

Methods with the same name as the class as in the code fragment are called constructors. When you create (instantiate) an object of the Point class, the constructor method is invoked to perform any initialization that's needed--in this case, to set the instance variables to an initial state.
This example is a variation on the Point class from before. Now, when you wish to create and initialize Point objects, you can get them initialized to their default values, or you can initialize them to specific values:
Point lowerLeft; Point upperRight;

lowerLeft = new Point();

/* initialize to default zero value */

upperRight = new Point(100.0, 200.0); /* initialize to non- zero */

The specific constructor that's used when creating a new Point object is determined from the type and number of parameters in the new invocation.

The this Variable
What's the this variable in the examples above? this refers to the object you're "in" right now. In other words, this refers to the receiving object. You use this to clarify which variable you're referring to. In the two-parameter Point method, this.x means the x instance variable of this object, rather than the x parameter to the Point method.
In the example above, the constructors are simply conveniences for the Point class. Situations arise, however, where constructors are necessary, especially in cases where the object being instantiated must itself instantiate other objects. Let's illustrate one of those situations by declaring a Rectangle class that uses two Point objects to define its bounds:
class Rectangle extends Object { private Point lowerLeft; private Point upperRight;
Rectangle() { lowerLeft = new Point(); upperRight = new Point();
} ...
instance methods appear in here ...
}

The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3

In this example, the Rectangle constructor is vitally necessary to ensure that the two Point objects are instantiated at the time a Rectangle object is instantiated, otherwise, the Rectangle object would subsequently try to reference points that have not yet been allocated, and would fail.
3.3.4 Methods and Messaging

Method Method

Method Method

Method Instance Variables Method

Message

Method Instance Variables Method

If an object wants another object to do some work on its behalf, then in the parlance of object-oriented programming, the first object sends a message to the second object. In response, the second object selects the appropriate method to invoke. Java method invocations look similar to functions in C and C++.
Using the message passing paradigms of object-oriented programming, you can build entire networks and webs of objects that pass messages between them to change state. This programming technique is one of the best ways to create models and simulations of complex real-world systems. Let's redefine the declaration of the Point class from above such that its instance variables are private, and supply it with accessor methods to access those variables.
class Point extends Object { private double x; /* instance variable */ private double y; /* instance variable */

Point() { /* constructor to initialize to zero */ x = 0.0; y = 0.0;
} /* constructor to initialize to specific value
Point(double x, double y) {

*/

Java is Object Oriented

38

3

this.x = x; this.y = y; } public void setX(double x) { /* accessor method */ this.x = x; } public void setY(double y) { /* accessor method */ this.y = y; } public double getX() { /* accessor method */ return x; } public double getY() { /* accessor method */ return y; } }

These method declarations provide the flavor of how the Point class provides access to its variables from the outside world. Another object that wants to manipulate the instance variables of Point objects must now do so via the accessor methods:

Point myPoint;

// declares a variable to refer to a Point object

myPoint = new Point();
myPoint.setX(10.0); myPoint.setY(25.7);

// allocates an instance of a Point object // sets the x variable via the accessor method

Making instance variables public or private is a design tradeoff the designer makes when declaring the classes. By making instance variables public, you expose details of the class implementation, thereby providing higher efficiency and conciseness of expression at the possible expense of hindering future maintenance efforts. By hiding details of the internal implementation of a class, you have the potential to change the implementation of the class in the future without breaking any code that uses that class.

3.3.5 Finalizers
You can also declare an optional finalizer that will perform necessary tear-down actions when the garbage collector is about to free an object. This code fragment illustrates a finalize method in a class.

39 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3
/** * Close the stream when garbage is collected. */
protected void finalize() { try { file.close(); } catch (Exception e) { }
}
This finalize method will be invoked when the object is about to be garbage collected, which means that the object must shut itself down in an orderly fashion. In the particular code fragment above, the finalize method merely closes an I/O file stream that was used by the object, to ensure that the file descriptor for the stream is closed.
3.3.6 Subclasses
Subclasses are the mechanism by which new and enhanced objects can be defined in terms of existing objects. One example: a zebra is a horse with stripes. If you wish to create a zebra object, you notice that a zebra is kind of like a horse, only with stripes. In object-oriented terms, you'd create a new class called Zebra, which is a subclass of the Horse class. In Java language terms, you'd do something like this:
class Zebra extends Horse { Your new instance variables and new methods go here
}
The definition of Horse, wherever it is, would define all the methods to describe the behavior of a horse: eat, neigh, trot, gallop, buck, and so on. The only method you need to override is the method for drawing the hide. You gain the benefit of already written code that does all the work--you don't have to re-invent the wheel, or in this case, the hoof. The extends keyword tells the Java compiler that Zebra is a subclass of Horse. Zebra is said to be a derived class--it's derived from Horse, which is called a superclass.
Here's an example of making a subclass which is a variant of our Point class from previous examples to create a new three-dimensional point called ThreePoint:
class Point extends Object { protected double x; /* instance variable */ protected double y; /* instance variable */

Java is Object Oriented

40

3

Point() { /* constructor to initialize to zero */ x = 0.0; y = 0.0;
} }
class ThreePoint extends Point { protected double z; /* the z coordinate of the point

*/

ThreePoint() {

/* default constructor */

x = 0.0;

/* initialize the coordinates */

y = 0.0;

z = 0.0;

}

ThreePoint(double x, double y, double z) {/* specific constructor */

this.x = x;

/* initialize the coordinates */

this.y = y;

this.z = z;

}

}

Notice that ThreePoint adds a new instance variable for the z coordinate of the point. The x and y instance variables are inherited from the original Point class, so there's no need to declare them in ThreePoint. However, notice we had to make Point's instance variables protected instead of private as in the previous examples. Had we left Point's instance variables private, even its subclasses would be unable to access them, and the compilation would fail.

Subclasses enable you to use existing code that's already been developed and, much more important, tested, for a more generic case. You override the parts of the class you need for your specific behavior. Thus, subclasses gain you reuse

41 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3
of existing code--you save on design, development, and testing. The Java runtime system provides several libraries of utility functions that are tested and are also thread safe.
All classes in Java ultimately inherit from Object. Object is the most general of all the classes. New classes that you declare add functionality to their superclasses. The further down the class hierarchy you go--that is, the further you get from Object--the more specialized you classes become.
Single Inheritance and the Class Hierarchy Java implements what is known as a single-inheritance model. A new class can subclass (extend, in Java terminology) only one other class. Ultimately, all classes eventually inherit from the Object class, forming a tree structure with Object as its root. This picture illustrates the class hierarchy of the classes in the Java utility package, java.util.
The HashTable class is a subclass of Dictionary, which in turn is a subclass of Object. Dictionary inherits all of Object's variables and methods (behavior), then adds new variables and behavior of its own. Similarly, HashTable inherits all of Object's variables and behavior, plus all of Dictionary's variables and behavior, and goes on to add its own variables and behavior.
Then the Properties class subclasses HashTable in turn, inheriting all the variables and behavior of its class hierarchy. In a similar manner, Stack and ObserverList are subclasses of Vector, which in turn is a subclass of Object. The power of the object-oriented methodology is apparent--none of the subclasses needed to re-implement the basic functionality of their superclasses, but needed only add their own specialized behavior.

However, the above diagram points out the minor weakness with the singleinheritance model. Notice that there are two different kinds of enumerator classes in the picture, both of which inherit from Object. An enumerator class
implements behavior that iterates through a collection, obtaining the elements of that collection one by one. The enumerator classes define behavior that both HashTable and Vector find useful. Other, as yet undefined collection classes, such as list or queue, may also need the behavior of the enumeration classes. Unfortunately, they can inherit from only one superclass.

The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3
A possible method to solve this problem would be to enhance some superclass in the hierarchy to add such useful behavior when it becomes apparent that many subclasses could use the behavior. Such an approach would lead to chaos and bloat. If every time some common useful behavior were required for all subsequent subclasses, a class such as Object would be undergoing constant modification, would grow to enormous size and complexity, and the specification of its behavior would be constantly changing. Such a "solution" is untenable. The elegant and workable solution to the problem is provided via Java interfaces, the subject of the next topic.
3.3.7 Java Language Interfaces
Interfaces were introduced to Java to enhance Java's single-inheritance model. The designers of Java decided that multiple inheritance created too many problems for programmers and compiler writers, and decided that a single inheritance model was better overall. Some of the problems described in the previous discussion on the single-inheritance model are solved in a more elegant fashion by the use of interfaces.
An interface in the Java language is simply a specification of methods that an object declares it implements. An interface does not include instance variables or implementation code--only declarations of constants and methods. The concept of an interface in the Java language was borrowed from the ObjectiveC concept of a protocol.
Whereas a class can inherit from only one superclass, a class can implement as many interfaces as it chooses to. Using the examples from the previous discussion, the HashTableEnumerator and VectorEnumerator classes both implement an Enumeration interface that's specific to the characteristics of the HashTable and Vector classes. When you define a new collection class--a Queue class, for instance--you'll also probably define a QueueEnumerator class that implements the Enumeration interface.
The concept of the interface is powerful--classes that implement a given interface need do so only at the appropriate level in the class hierarchy. This picture illustrates the use of interfaces.

In this illustration, interfaces are represented by rectangles. You see that the Cloneable interface is implemented by multiple classes. In addition, the HashtableEnumerator and the VectorEnumerator classes both implement
45 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3

the Enumeration interface. Any given class can implement as many interfaces as it wants to, and in any way that it wants to. Details of the actual implementation of the interface are hidden within the class definition, and should be replaceable without affecting the outside view of the interface in any way. Recall, however, that an interface merely declares methods; it does not
implement them. When inheriting from classes (in languages such as C++), the implementation of inherited classes is also inherited, so more code can be reused when compared to the amount of code re-use in multiply-inherited interfaces. For this reason, inheriting from interfaces provides a reasonable alternative to multiple inheritance, but this practice should not be seen as a substitute for the more powerful but often confusing practice of inheriting from multiple classes.
3.3.8 Access Control
When you declare a new class in Java, you can indicate the level of access permitted to its members--that is, its instance variables and methods. Java provides four levels of access. Three of the levels must be explicitly specified: public, protected, and private. Members declared public are available to any other class anywhere. Members declared protected are accessible only to subclasses of that class, and nowhere else. Members declared private are accessible only from within the class in which they're declared--they're not available even to their subclasses.

The fourth access level doesn't have a name--it's often called "friendly" and is the access level you obtain if you don't specify otherwise. The "friendly" access level indicates that the class's members are accessible to all objects within the same package, but inaccessible to objects outside the package. Packages, a useful tool for grouping together related collections of classes and interfaces, are discussed below.
3.3.9 Packages
Java packages are collections of classes and interfaces that are related to each other in some useful way. Such classes need to be able to access each other's instance variables and methods directly. A geometry package consisting of Point and Rectangle classes, for instance, might well be easier and cleaner to implement--as well as more efficient--if the Point's instance variables

Java is Object Oriented

46

3
were directly available to the Rectangle class. Outside of the geometry package, however, the details of implementations are hidden from the rest of the world, giving you the freedom to changed implementation details without worrying you'll break code that uses those classes. Packages are created by storing the source files for the classes and interfaces of each package in a separate directory in the file system.
The primary benefit of packages is the ability to organize many class definitions into a single unit. For example, all the Java I/O system code is collected into a single package called java.io. The secondary benefit from the programmer's viewpoint is that the "friendly" instance variables and methods are available to all classes within the same package, but not to classes defined outside the package.
3.3.10 Class Variables and Class Methods
Java follows conventions from other object-oriented languages in providing class methods and class variables. Normally, variables you declare in a class definition are instance variables--there is one of those variables in every separate object created (instantiated) from the class. A class variable, on the other hand, is local to the class itself--there's only a single copy of the variable and it's shared by every object you instantiate from the class.
To declare class variables and class methods in Java programs, you declare them static. This short code fragment illustrates the declaration of class variables:
class Rectangle extends Object { static final int version = 2; static final int revision = 0;
}
The Rectangle class declares two static variables to define the version and revision level of this class. Now, every instance of Rectangle you create from this class will share these same variables. Notice they're also defined as final because you want them to be constants.
Class methods are common to an entire class. When would you use class methods? Usually, when you have behavior that's common to every object of a class. For example, suppose you have a Window class. A useful item of information you can ask the class is the current number of currently open windows. This information is shared by every instance of Window and it is
47 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3
only available through knowledge obtained from other instances of Window. For these reasons, it is necessary to have just one class method to return the number of open windows.
In general, class methods can operate only on class variables. Class methods can't access instance variables, nor can they invoke instance methods. Like class variables, you declare class methods by defining them as static.
We say, "in general", because you could pass an object reference to a class method, and the class method could then operate on the object's public instance variables, and invoke the object's instance methods via the reference. However, you're usually better off doing only class-like operations at the class level, and doing object-like operations at the object level.
3.3.11 Abstract Methods
Abstract methods are a powerful construct in the object-oriented paradigm. To understand abstract methods, we look at the notion of an abstract superclass. An abstract superclass is a class in which you declare methods that aren't actually implemented by that class--they only provide place-holders that subsequent subclasses must override and supply their actual implementation.
This all sounds wonderfully, well, abstract, so why would you need an abstract superclass? Let's look at a concrete example, no pun intended. Let's suppose you're going to a restaurant for dinner, and you decide that tonight you want to eat fish. Well, fish is somewhat abstract--you generally wouldn't just order fish; the waiter is highly likely to ask you what specific kind of fish you want. When you actually get to the restaurant, you will find out what kind of fish they have, and order a specific fish, say, sturgeon, or salmon, or opakapaka.
In the world of objects, an abstract class is like generic fish--the abstract class defines generic state and generic behavior, but you'll never see a real live implementation of an abstract class. What you will see is a concrete subclass of the abstract class, just as opakapaka is a specific (concrete) kind of fish.
Suppose you are creating a drawing application. The initial cut of your application can draw rectangles, lines, circles, polygons, and so on. Furthermore, you have a series of operations you can perform on the shapes--move, reshape, rotate, fill color, and so on. You could make each of these graphic shapes a separate class--you'd have a Rectangle class, a Line

Java is Object Oriented

48

3
49

class, and so on. Each class needs instance variables to define its position, size, color, rotation and so on, which in turn dictates methods to set and get at those variables.

At this point, you realize you can collect all the instance variables into a single abstract superclass called Graphical, and implement most of the methods to manipulate the variables in that abstract superclass. The skeleton of your abstract superclass might look something like this:

abstract class Graphical extends Object {

protected Point lowerLeft;

// lower left of bounding box

protected Point upperRight; // upper right of bounding box

...

more instance variables

...

public void setPosition(Point ll, Point ur) {

lowerLeft = ll;

upperRight = ur;

}

abstract void drawMyself(); // abstract method

}

}

Now, you can't instantiate the Graphical class, because it's declared abstract. You can only instantiate a subclass of it. You would implement the Rectangle class or the Circle class as a subclass of Graphical. Within Rectangle, you'd provide a concrete implementation of the drawMySelf method that draws a rectangle, because the definition of drawMySelf must by necessity be unique to each shape inherited from the Graphical class. Let's see a small fragment of the Rectangle class declaration, where its drawMySelf method operates in a somewhat PostScript'y fashion:

abstract class Rectangle extends Graphical {

void drawMySelf() {

// really does the drawing

moveTo(lowerLeft.x, lowerLeft.y);

lineTo(upperRight.x, lowerLeft.y);

lineTo(upperRight.x, upperRight.y)

lineTo(lowerLeft.x, upperRight.y);

...

and so on and so on

...

}

}

The Java Language Environment--May 1996

3.4 Summary

3
Notice, however, that in the declaration of the Graphical class, the setPosition method was declared as a regular (public void) method. All methods that can be implemented by the abstract superclass can be declared there and their implementations defined at that time. Then, every class that inherits from the abstract superclass will also inherit those methods.
You can continue in this way adding new shapes that are subclasses of Graphical, and most of the time, all you ever need to implement is the methods that are unique to the specific shape. You gain the benefit of re-using all the code that was defined inside the abstract superclass.
This chapter has conveyed the essential aspects of Java as an object-oriented language. To sum up:
 Classes define templates from which you instantiate (create) distinct concrete
objects.
 Instance variables hold the state of a specific object.  Objects communicate by sending messages to each other. Objects respond to
messages by selecting a method to execute.
 Methods define the behavior of objects instantiated from a class. It is an
object's methods that manipulate its instance variables. Unlike regular procedural languages, classes in an object-oriented language may have methods with the same names as other classes. A given object responds to a message in ways determined by the nature of that object, providing polymorphic behavior.
 Subclasses provide the means by which a new class can inherit instance
variables and methods from any already defined class. The newly declared class can add new instance variables (extra state), can add new methods (new behavior), or can override the methods of its superclass (different behavior). Subclasses provide code reuse.
Taken together, the concepts of object-oriented programming create a powerful and simple paradigm for software developers to share and re-use code and build on the work of others.

Architecture Neutral, Portable, and Robust

4

With the phenomenal growth of networks, today's developers must "think distributed". Applications--even parts of applications--must be able to migrate easily to a wide variety of computer systems, a wide variety of hardware architectures, and a wide variety of operating system architectures. They must operate with a plethora of graphical user interfaces.
Clearly, applications must be able to execute anywhere on the network without prior knowledge of the target hardware and software platform. If application developers are forced to develop for specific target platforms, the binary distribution problem quickly becomes unmanageable. Various and sundry methods have been employed to overcome the problem, such as creating "fat" binaries that adapt to the specific hardware architecture, but such methods are not only clumsy but are still geared to a specific operating system. To solve the binary-distribution problem, software applications and fragments of applications must be architecture neutral and portable.
Reliability is also at a high premium in the distributed world. Code from anywhere on the network should work robustly with low probabilities of creating "crashes" in applications that import fragments of code.
This chapter describes the ways in which Java has addressed the issues of architecture neutrality, portability, and reliability.
50

4
4.1 Architecture Neutral
The solution that the Java system adopts to solve the binary-distribution problem is a "binary code format" that's independent of hardware architectures, operating system interfaces, and window systems. The format of this system-independent binary code is architecture neutral. If the Java run-time platform is made available for a given hardware and software environment, an application written in Java can then execute in that environment without the need to perform any special porting work for that application.
4.1.1 Byte Codes
The Java compiler doesn't generate "machine code" in the sense of native hardware instructions--rather, it generates bytecodes: a high-level, machineindependent code for a hypothetical machine that is implemented by the Java interpreter and run-time system.
One of the early examples of the bytecode approach was the UCSD P-System, which was ported to a variety of eight-bit architectures in the middle 1970s and early 1980s and enjoyed widespread popularity during the heyday of eight-bit machines. Coming up to the present day, current architectures have the power to support the bytecode approach for distributed software. Java bytecodes are designed to be easy to interpret on any machine, or to dynamically translate into native machine code if required by performance demands.
The architecture neutral approach is useful not only for network-based applications, but also for single-system software distribution. In today's software market, application developers have to produce versions of their applications that are compatible with the IBM PC, Apple Macintosh, and fiftyseven flavors of workstation and operating system architectures in the fragmented UNIX marketplace.
With the PC market (through Windows 95 and Windows NT) diversifying onto many CPU architectures, and Apple moving full steam from the 68000 to the PowerPC, production of software to run on all platforms becomes almost impossible until now. Using Java, coupled with the Abstract Window Toolkit, the same version of your application can run on all platforms.
51 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

4.2 Portable

4

The primary benefit of the interpreted byte code approach is that compiled Java language programs are portable to any system on which the Java interpreter and run-time system have been implemented.
The architecture-neutral aspect discussed above is one major step towards being portable, but there's more to it than that. C and C++ both suffer from the defect of designating many fundamental data types as "implementation dependent". Programmers labor to ensure that programs are portable across architectures by programming to a lowest common denominator.
Java eliminates this issue by defining standard behavior that will apply to the data types across all platforms. Java specifies the sizes of all its primitive data types and the behavior of arithmetic on them. Here are the data types:

byte short int long
float double
char

8-bit two's complement 16-bit two's complement 32-bit two's complement 64-bit two's complement
32-bit IEEE 754 floating point 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
16-bit Unicode character

The data types and sizes described above are standard across all implementations of Java. These choices are reasonable given current microprocessor architectures because essentially all central processor architectures in use today share these characteristics. That is, most modern processors can support two's-complement arithmetic in 8-bit to 64-bit integer formats, and most modern processors support single- and double-precision floating point.
The Java environment itself is readily portable to new architectures and operating systems. The Java compiler is written in Java. The Java run-time system is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary which is essentially POSIX-compliant. There are no "implementation-dependent" notes in the Java language specification.

Architecture Neutral, Portable, and Robust

52

4.3 Robust

Java is intended for developing software that must be robust, highly reliable, and secure, in a variety of ways. There's strong emphasis on early checking for possible problems, as well as later dynamic (run-time) checking, to eliminate error-prone situations.

4.3.1 Strict Compile-Time and Run-Time Checking
The Java compiler employs extensive and stringent compile-time checking so that syntax-related errors can be detected early, before a program is deployed.
One of the advantages of a strongly typed language (like C++) is that it allows extensive compile-time checking, so bugs can be found early. Unfortunately, C++ inherits a number of loopholes in its compile-time checking from C. Unfortunately, C++ and C are relatively lax, most notably in the area of method or function declarations. Java imposes much more stringent requirements on the developer: Java requires explicit declarations and does not support C-style implicit declarations.
Many of the stringent compile-time checks at the Java compiler level are carried over to the run time, both to check consistency at run time, and to provide greater flexibility. The linker understands the type system and repeats many of the type checks done by the compiler, to guard against version mismatch problems.
The single biggest difference between Java and C or C++ is that Java's memory model eliminates the possibility of overwriting memory and corrupting data. Instead of pointer arithmetic, Java has true arrays and strings, which means that the interpreter can check array and string indexes. In addition, a programmer can't write code that turns an arbitrary integer into an object reference by casting.
While Java doesn't pretend to completely remove the software quality assurance problem, removal of entire classes of programming errors considerably eases the job of testing and quality assurance.

Java--an architecture-neutral and portable programming language--provides an attractive and simple solution to the problem of distributing your applications across heterogeneous network-based computing platforms. In addition, the simplicity and robustness of the underlying Java language results in higher quality, reliable applications in which users can have a high level of confidence. The next chapter contains a brief discussion of Java's interpreted implementation.

Interpreted and Dynamic

5

Programmers using "traditional" software development tools have become resigned to the artificial edit-compile-link-load-throw-the-application-off-thecliff-let-it-crash-and-start-all-over-again style of current development practice.
Additionally, keeping track of what must be recompiled when a declaration changes somewhere else strains the capabilities of development tools--even fancy "make"-style tools such as found on UNIX systems. This development approach bogs down as the code bases of applications grow to hundreds of thousands of lines.
Better methods of fast and fearless prototyping and development are needed. The Java language environment is one of those better ways, because it's interpreted and dynamic.
As discussed in the previous chapter on architecture-neutrality, the Java compiler generates byte codes for the Java Virtual Machine*, which was introduced briefly in Chapter 4. The notion of a virtual interpreted machine is not new. But the Java language brings the concepts into the realm of secure, distributed, network-based systems.
The Java language virtual machine is a strictly defined virtual machine for which an interpreter must be available for each hardware architecture and operating system on which you wish to run Java language applications. Once
* One of the ancestors of the virtual machine concept was the UCSD P System, developed by Kenneth Bowles at the University of California at San Diego in the late 1970s.
56

5
you have the Java language interpreter and run-time support available on a given hardware and operating system platform, you can run any Java language application from anywhere, always assuming the specific Java language application is written in a portable manner.
The notion of a separate "link" phase after compilation is pretty well absent from the Java environment. Linking, which is actually the process of loading new classes by the Class Loader, is a more incremental and lightweight process. The concomitant speedup in your development cycle means that your development process can be much more rapid and exploratory, and because of the robust nature of the Java language and run-time system, you will catch bugs at a much earlier phase of the cycle.
5.1 Dynamic Loading and Binding
The Java language's portable and interpreted nature produces a highly dynamic and dynamically-extensible system. The Java language was designed to adapt to evolving environments. Classes are linked in as required and can be downloaded from across networks. Incoming code is verified before being passed to the interpreter for execution.
Object-oriented programming has become accepted as a means to solve at least a part of the "software crisis", by assisting encapsulation of data and corresponding procedures, and encouraging reuse of code. Most programmers doing object-oriented development today have adopted C++ as their language of choice. But C++ suffers from a serious problem that impedes its widespread use in the production and distribution of "software ICs". This defect is known as the fragile superclass problem.
5.1.1 The Fragile Superclass Problem
This problem arises as a side-effect of the way that C++ is usually implemented. Any time you add a new method or a new instance variable to a class, any and all classes that reference that class will require a recompilation, or they'll break. Keeping track of the dependencies between class definitions and their clients has proved to be a fruitful source of programming error in C++, even with the help of "make"-like utilities.The fragile superclass issue is sometimes also referred to as the "constant recompilation problem." You can avoid these problems in C++, but with extraordinary difficulty, and doing so
57 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

5
effectively means not using any of the language's object-oriented features directly. By avoiding the object-oriented features of C++, developers defeat the goal of re-usable "software ICs".
5.1.2 Solving the Fragile Superclass Problem
The Java language solves the fragile superclass problem in several stages. The Java compiler doesn't compile references down to numeric values--instead, it passes symbolic reference information through to the byte code verifier and the interpreter. The Java interpreter performs final name resolution once, when classes are being linked. Once the name is resolved, the reference is rewritten as a numeric offset, enabling the Java interpreter to run at full speed.
Finally, the storage layout of objects is not determined by the compiler. The layout of objects in memory is deferred to run time and determined by the interpreter. Updated classes with new instance variables or methods can be linked in without affecting existing code.
At the small expense of a name lookup the first time any name is encountered, the Java language eliminates the fragile superclass problem. Java programmers can use object-oriented programming techniques in a much more straightforward fashion without the constant recompilation burden engendered by C++. Libraries can freely add new methods and instance variables without any effect on their clients. Your life as a programmer is simpler.
5.1.3 Run-Time Representations
Classes in the Java language have a run-time representation. There is a class named Class, instances of which contain run-time class definitions. If you're handed an object, you can find out what class it belongs to. In a C or C++ program, you may be handed a pointer to an object, but if you don't know what type of object it is, you have no way to find out. In the Java language, finding out based on the run-time type information is straightforward.
It is also possible to look up the definition of a class given a string containing its name. This means that you can compute a data type name and easily have it dynamically-linked into the running system.

5.2 Summary

The interpreted and dynamic nature of Java provides several benefits:
 The interpreted environment enables fast prototyping without waiting for
the traditional compile and link cycle,
 The environment is dynamically extensible, whereby classes are loaded on
the fly as required,
 The fragile superclass problem that plagues C++ developers is eliminated
because of deferral of memory layout decisions to run time.

Security in Java

6

Security commands a high premium in the growing use of the Internet for products and services ranging from electronic distribution of software and multimedia content, to "digital cash". The area of security with which we're concerned here is how the Java compiler and run-time system restrict application programmers from creating subversive code.
The Java language compiler and run-time system implement several layers of defense against potentially incorrect code. The environment starts with the assumption that nothing is to be trusted, and proceeds accordingly. The next few sections discuss the Java security models in greater detail.
6.1 Memory Allocation and Layout
One of the Java compiler's primary lines of defense is its memory allocation and reference model. First of all, memory layout decisions are not made by the Java language compiler, as they are in C and C++. Rather, memory layout is deferred to run time, and will potentially differ depending on the characteristics of the hardware and software platforms on which the Java system executes.
Secondly, Java does not have "pointers" in the traditional C and C++ sense of memory cells that contain the addresses of other memory cells.The Java compiled code references memory via symbolic "handles" that are resolved to real memory addresses at run time by the Java interpreter. Java programmers

60

6
can't forge pointers to memory, because the memory allocation and referencing model is completely opaque to the programmer and controlled entirely by the underlying run-time platform.
Very late binding of structures to memory means that programmers can't infer the physical memory layout of a class by looking at its declaration. By removing the C and C++ memory layout and pointer models, the Java language has eliminated the programmer's ability to get behind the scenes and either forge or otherwise manufacture pointers to memory. These features must be viewed as positive benefits rather than a restriction on the programmer, because they ultimately lead to more reliable and secure applications.
6.2 Security Checks in the Class Loader
While a Java program is executing, it may in its turn request that a particular class or set of classes be loaded, possibly from across the network. After incoming code has been vetted and determined clean by the bytecode verifier, the next line of defense is the Java bytecode loader. The environment seen by a thread of execution running Java bytecodes can be visualized as a set of classes partitioned into separate name spaces. There is one name space for classes that come from the local file system, and a separate name space for each network source.
When a class is imported from across the network it is placed into the private name space associated with its origin. When a class references another class, it is first looked for in the name space for the local system (built-in classes), then in the name space of the referencing class. There is no way that an imported class can "spoof" a built-in class. Built-in classes can never accidentally reference classes in imported name spaces--they can only reference such classes explicitly. Similarly, classes imported from different places are separated from each other.
6.3 The Byte Code Verification Process
What about the concept of a "hostile compiler"? Although the Java compiler ensures that Java source code doesn't violate the safety rules, when an application such as the HotJava Browser imports a code fragment from anywhere, it doesn't actually know if code fragments follow Java language rules for safety: the code may not have been produced by a known-to-be trustworthy Java compiler. In such a case, how is the Java run-time system on
61 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

6
your machine to trust the incoming bytecode stream? The answer is simple: the Java run-time system doesn't trust the incoming code, but subjects it to bytecode verification.
The tests range from simple verification that the format of a code fragment is correct, to passing each code fragment through a simple theorem prover to establish that it plays by the rules:
 it doesn't forge pointers,  it doesn't violate access restrictions,  it accesses objects as what they are (for example, InputStream objects are
always used as InputStreams and never as anything else).
A language that is safe, plus run-time verification of generated code, establishes a base set of guarantees that interfaces cannot be violated.

The illustration shows the flow of data and control from Java language source code through the Java compiler, to the class loader and bytecode verifier and hence on to the Java virtual machine, which contains the interpreter and runtime system. The important issue is that the Java class loader and the bytecode verifier make no assumptions about the primary source of the bytecode stream--the code may have come from the local system, or it may have travelled halfway around the planet. The bytecode verifier acts as a sort of gatekeeper: it ensures that code passed to the Java interpreter is in a fit state to be executed and can run without fear of breaking the Java interpreter. Imported code is not allowed to execute by any means until after it has passed the verifier's tests. Once the verifier is done, a number of important properties are known:
 There are no operand stack overflows or underflows

63 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

6

 The types of the parameters of all bytecode instructions are known to
always be correct
 Object field accesses are known to be legal--private, public, or protected
While all this checking appears excruciatingly detailed, by the time the bytecode verifier has done its work, the Java interpreter can proceed, knowing that the code will run securely. Knowing these properties makes the Java interpreter much faster, because it doesn't have to check anything. There are no operand type checks and no stack overflow checks. The interpreter can thus function at full speed without compromising reliability.

6.4 Security in the Java Networking Package
Java's networking package provides the interfaces to handle the various network protocols (FTP, HTTP, Telnet, and so on). This is your front line of defense at the network interface level. The networking package can be set up with configurable levels of paranoia. You can
 Disallow all network accesses  Allow network accesses to only the hosts from which the code was imported  Allow network accesses only outside the firewall if the code came from
outside
 Allow all network accesses

6.5 Summary

Java is secure to survive in the network-based environment. The architectureneutral and portable aspects of the Java language make it the ideal development language to meet the challenges of distributing dynamically extensible software across networks.

Multithreading

7

Sophisticated computer users become impatient with the do-one-thing-at-atime mindset of the average personal computer. Users perceive that their world is full of multiple events all happening at once, and they like to have their computers work the same way.
Unfortunately, writing programs that deal with many things happening at once can be much more difficult than writing in the conventional single-threaded C and C++ style. You can write multithreaded applications in languages such as C and C++, but the level of difficulty goes up by orders of magnitude, and even then there are no assurances that vendors' libraries are thread-safe.
The term thread-safe means that a given library function is implemented in such a manner that it can be executed by multiple concurrent threads of execution.
The major problem with explicitly programmed thread support is that you can never be quite sure you have acquired the locks you need and released them again at the right time. If you return from a method prematurely, for instance, or if an exception is raised, for another instance, your lock has not been released; deadlock is the usual result.
7.1 Threads at the Java Language Level
Built-in support for threads provides Java programmers with a powerful tool to improve interactive performance of graphical applications. If your application needs to run animations and play music while scrolling the page and

66

7
downloading a text file from a server, multithreading is the way to obtain fast, lightweight concurrency within a single process space. Threads are sometimes also called lightweight processes or execution contexts.
Threads are an essential keystone of Java. The Java library provides a Thread class that supports a rich collection of methods to start a thread, run a thread, stop a thread, and check on a thread's status.
Java thread support includes a sophisticated set of synchronization primitives based on the widely used monitor and condition variable paradigm introduced twenty years ago by C.A.R. Hoare and implemented in a production setting in Xerox PARC's Cedar/Mesa system. Integrating support for threads into the language makes them much easier to use and more robust. Much of the style of Java's integration of threads was modelled after Cedar and Mesa.
Java's threads are pre-emptive, and depending on platform on which the Java interpreter executes, threads can also be time-sliced. On systems that don't support time-slicing, once a thread has started, the only way it will relinquish control of the processor is if another thread of a higher priority takes control of the processor. If your applications are likely to be compute-intensive, you might consider how to give up control periodically by using the yield() method to give other threads a chance to run; doing so will ensure better interactive response for graphical applications.
7.2 Integrated Thread Synchronization
Java supports multithreading at the language (syntactic) level and via support from its run-time system and thread objects. At the language level, methods within a class that are declared synchronized do not run concurrently. Such methods run under control of monitors to ensure that variables remain in a consistent state. Every class and instantiated object has its own monitor that comes into play if required.
Here are a couple of code fragments from the sorting demonstration in the HotJava web browser. The main points of interest are the two methods stop and startSort, which share a common variable called kicker (it kicks off the sort thread): public synchronized void stop() {
if (kicker != null) { kicker.stop();
67 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

7
kicker = null; } }
private synchronized void startSort() { if (kicker == null || !kicker.isAlive()) { kicker = new Thread(this); kicker.start(); }
}
The stop and startSort methods are declared to be synchronized--they can't run concurrently, enabling them to maintain consistent state in the shared kicker variable. When a synchronized method is entered, it acquires a monitor on the current object. The monitor precludes any other synchronized methods in that object from running. When a synchronized method returns by any means, its monitor is released. Other synchronized methods within the same object are now free to run.
If you're writing Java applications, you should take care to implement your classes and methods so they're thread-safe, in the same way that Java run-time libraries are thread-safe. If you wish your objects to be thread-safe, any methods that may change the values of instance variables should be declared synchronized. This ensures that only one method can change the state of an object at any time. Java monitors are re-entrant: a method can acquire the same monitor more than once, and everything will still work.
7.3 Multithreading Support--Conclusion
While other systems have provided facilities for multithreading (usually via "lightweight process" libraries), building multithreading support into the language as Java has done provides the programmer with a much more powerful tool for easily creating thread-safe multithreaded classes.
Other benefits of multithreading are better interactive responsiveness and realtime behavior. Stand-alone Java run-time environments exhibit good real-time behavior. Java environments running on top of popular operating systems provide the real-time responsiveness available from the underlying platform.

Performance and Comparisons

8

8.1 Performance

This chapter addresses two issues of interest to prospective adopters of Java, namely, what is the performance of Java, and how does it stack up against other comparable programming languages? Let's first address the performance question and then move on to a brief comparison with other languages.

Java has been ported to and run on a variety of hardware platforms executing a variety of operating system software. Test measurement of some simple Java programs on current high-end computer systems such as workstations and high-performance personal computers show results roughly as follows:

new Object new C() (class with several methods) o.f() (method f invoked on object o) o.sf() (synchronized method f invoked on object o)

119,000 per second 89,000 per second 590,000 per second 61,500 per second

Thus, we see that creating a new object requires approximately 8.4 탎ec, creating a new class containing several methods consumes about 11 탎ec, and invoking a method on an object requires roughly 1.7 탎ec.

While these performance numbers for interpreted bytecodes are usually more than adequate to run interactive graphical end-user applications, situations may arise where higher performance is required. In such cases, Java bytecodes can be translated on the fly (at run time) into machine code for the particular CPU on which the application is executing. This process is performed by the

70

8
Just In Time (JIT) compiler. For those accustomed to the normal design of a compiler and dynamic loader, the Just In Time compiler is somewhat like putting the final machine code generator in the dynamic loader.
The bytecode format was designed with generating machine codes in mind, so the actual process of generating machine code is generally simple. Reasonably good code is produced: it does automatic register allocation and the compiler does some optimization when it produces the bytecodes. Performance of bytecodes converted to machine code is roughly the same as native C or C++.
8.2 The Java Language Compared
There are literally hundreds of programming languages available for developers to write programs to solve problems in specific areas. Programming languages cover a spectrum ranging across fully interpreted languages such as UNIX Shells, awk, TCL, Perl, and so on, all the way to "programming to the bare metal" languages like C and C++.
Languages at the level of the Shells and TCL, for example, are fully interpreted high-level languages. They deal with "objects" (in the sense they can be said to deal with objects at all) at the system level, where their objects are files and processes rather than data structures. Some of these languages are suitable for very fast prototyping--you can develop your ideas quickly, try out new approaches, and discard non-working approaches without investing enormous amounts of time in the process. Scripting languages are also highly portable. Their primary drawback is performance; they are generally much slower than either native machine code or interpreted bytecodes. This tradeoff may well be reasonable if the run time of such a program is reasonably short and you use the program infrequently.
In the intermediate ground come languages like Perl, that share many characteristics in common with Java. Perl's ongoing evolution has led to the adoption of object-oriented features, security features, and it exhibits many features in common with Java, such as robustness, dynamic behavior, architecture neutrality, and so on.
At the lowest level are compiled languages such as C and C++, in which you can develop large-scale programming projects that will deliver high performance. The high performance comes at a cost, however. Drawbacks include the high cost of debugging unreliable memory management systems and the use of multithreading capabilities that are difficult to implement and
71 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

8
use. And of course when you use C++, you have the perennial fragile superclass issue. Last but definitely not least, the binary distribution problem of compiled code becomes unmanageable in the context of heterogeneous platforms all over the Internet.
The Java language environment creates an extremely attractive middle ground between very high-level and portable but slow scripting languages and very low level and fast but non-portable and unreliable compiled languages. The Java language fits somewhere in the middle of this space. In addition to being extremely simple to program, highly portable and architecture neutral, the Java language provides a level of performance that's entirely adequate for all but the most compute-intensive applications.
Prospective adopters of the Java language need to examine where the Java language fits into the firmament of other languages. Here is a basic comparison chart illustrating the attributes of the Java language--simple, object-oriented, threaded, and so on--as described in the earlier parts of this paper.

8.3 A Major Benefit of Java: Fast and Fearless Prototyping
Very dynamic languages like Lisp, TCL, and SmallTalk are often used for prototyping. One of the reasons for their success at this is that they are very robust--you don't have to worry about freeing or corrupting memory.
Similarly, programmers can be relatively fearless about dealing with memory when programming in Java. The garbage collection system makes the programmer's job vastly easier; with the burden of memory management taken off the programmer's shoulders, storage allocation errors go away.
Another reason commonly given that languages like Lisp, TCL, and SmallTalk are good for prototyping is that they don't require you to pin down decisions early on--these languages are semantically rich.
Java has exactly the opposite property: it forces you to make explicit choices. Along with these choices come a lot of assistance--you can write method invocations and, if you get something wrong, you get told about it at compile time. You don't have to worry about method invocation error.

8.4 Summary

From the discussion above, you can see that the Java language provides high performance, while its interpreted nature makes it the ideal development platform for fast and fearless prototyping. From the previous chapters, you've seen that the Java language is extremely simple and object oriented. The language is secure to survive in the network-based environment. The architecture-neutral and portable aspects of the Java language make it the ideal development language to meet the challenges of distributing dynamically extensible software across networks.

Now We Move On to the HotJava World-Wide Web Browser
These first eight chapters have been your introduction to the Java language environment. You've learned about the capabilities of Java and its clear benefits to develop software for the distributed world. Now it's time to move on to the next chapter and take a look at the HotJava World-Wide Web browser--a major end-user application developed to make use of the dynamic features of the Java language environment.

Java Base System and Libraries

The complete Java system includes several libraries of utility classes and methods of use to developers in creating multi-platform applications. Very briefly, these libraries are:
Basic Java language classes--java.lang
The Input/Output package--java.io
The Java Utilities package--java.util
The Abstract Window Toolkit--java.awt
9.1 Java Language Classes
The java.lang package contains the collection of base types (language types) that are always imported into any given compilation unit. This where you'll find the declarations of Object (the root of the class hierarchy) and Class, plus threads, exceptions, wrappers for the primitive data types, and a variety of other fundamental classes.
This picture illustrates the classes in java.lang, excluding all the exception and error classes.

Note the Boolean, Character, and Number classes--these classes are "wrapper" classes for the primitive types. You use these classes in applications where the primitive types must be stored as objects. Note also the Throwable class--this is the root class for all exceptions and errors.
9.2 Input Output Package
The java.io package contains the declarations of classes to deal with streams and random-access files. This is where you find the rough equivalent of the Standard I/O Library you're familiar with on most UNIX systems. A further library is called java.net, which provides support for sockets, telnet interfaces, and URLs.
This picture shows the class hierarchy of the I/O package.

The HotJava World-Wide Web Browser

10

It's a jungle out there, So drink your Java
T-shirt caption from Printer's Inc Cafe, Palo Alto, California

The HotJavaTM Browser ("HotJava") is a new World-Wide Web browser implemented entirely in the Java programming language. HotJava is the first major end-user application created using the Java programming language to run on the Java platform. HotJava not only showcases the powerful features of the Java environment, it also provides an ideal platform for distributing Java programs across the Internet--the most complex, distributed, heterogeneous network in the world.HotJava and its rapidly growing Web population of Java language programs called applets (mini-applications), are the most compelling demonstration of the dynamic capabilities of Java.
HotJava includes many innovative features and capabilities above and beyond the first generation of static Web browsers. HotJava is extensible. Its foremost feature is its ability to download Java programs (applets) from anywhere, even across networks, and execute them on the user's machine. HotJava builds on the network-browsing techniques established by Mosaic and other Web browsers and expands them by adding dynamic behavior that transforms static documents into dynamic applications.

82

10
HotJava goes far beyond the first generation of statically-oriented Web browsers and brings a much needed measure of interactivity to the concept of the Web browser. It transforms the existing static data display of first generation Web browsers into a new and dynamic viewing system for hypertext, which is described below. HotJava enables creation and display of animation-oriented applications. World-Wide Web content developers can have their applications distributed across the Internet with the click of a button on the user's client computer.
Java has been adopted enthusiastically by the internet community and Java capabilities have appeared in many Internet-related products like Web browsers and other client-server applications.
10.1 The Evolution of Cyberspace
The Internet has evolved into an amorphous ocean of data stored in many formats on a multiplicity of network hosts. Over time, various data storage and transmission protocols have evolved to impose some order on this chaos. One of the fastest growing areas of the net--the one we're primarily interested in here--is the World-Wide Web (WWW), which uses a hypertext-based markup system to enable users to navigate their way across the oceans of data.
The concept of hypertext is by no means new, but its realization has spanned decades. The idea behind hypertext was described in an essay by Vannevar Bush in 1945, and evangelized by Theodore (Ted) Nelson in the 1960s and 1970s. Although Apple Computer's HyperCard product for Macintosh provided an early if somewhat primitive implementation, the real power of hypertext comes from the ability to create inter-document links across multiple host computers on the network. The first practical if small implementation of a network-based hypertext system was created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, using the NEXTSTEP development environment to create what would blossom into HTML (HyperText Markup Language), HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol), and the WWW (World-Wide Web, or W3).
Web browsers combine the functions of fetching data with figuring out what the data is and displaying it if possible. One of the most prevalent file formats browsers deal with is HyperText Markup Language, or HTML-- a markup language that embeds simple text-formatting commands within text to be formatted. The main key to the hypertext concept is HTML's use of links to other HTML pages either on the same host or elsewhere on the Internet.
83 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

10
A user in search of gold mining data, for instance, can follow links across the net from Mountain View, California, to the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, and arrive back at commercial data providers in Montreal, Canada, all within the context of tracing links in hypertext "pages". For a topic of timely relevance to the World-Wide Web, a user interested in aspects of multimedia law relative to the World-Wide Web can tune in to the home page at www.oikoumene.com/oikoumene for links to intellectual property issues.
10.1.1 First Generation Browsers
What we could call the "first-generation" Web browsers--exemplified by NCSA Mosaic and early versions of Netscape Navigator--provide only an illusion of being interactive. By using the (somewhat limited) language of HTML these browsers provide hypertext links on which you can click. The browser goes off across the network to fetch the data associated with that link, downloads the data, and displays it on your local screen.

This illustration depicts roughly the "interactive" flow of control in the firstgeneration Web browsers. You can see that it's not really highly interactive--it's just a fancy data fetching and display utility with fixed hypertext links. It does not dynamically handle new data types, protocols, or behaviors.

The HotJava World-Wide Web Browser

84

10

HotJava brings a new twist to the concept of client-server computing. The general view of client-server computing is a big centralized server that clients connect to for a long time and from which they access data and applications. The client-server model is roughly a star with a big server in the middle and clients arrayed around it. The new model exemplified by the World-Wide Web is a wide-spread collection of independent nodes with short-lived connections between clients and many servers. The controlling intelligence shifts from the server to the client and the answer to "who's in charge?" shifts from the server to the client.

The primary problem with the first-generation web browsers is that they're built in a monolithic fashion with their awareness of every possible type of data, protocol, and behavior hard-wired in order for them to navigate the Web. This means that every time a new data type, protocol, or behavior is invented, these browsers must be upgraded to be cognizant of the new situation. From the viewpoint of end users, this is an untenable position to be in. Users must continually be aware of what protocols exist, which browsers deal with those protocols, and which versions of which browsers are compatible with each other. Given the growth of the Internet, this situation is clearly out of control.
85 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

10
10.1.2 The HotJava Browser--A New Concept in Web Browsers
HotJava solves the monolithic approach and moves the focus of interactivity away from the Web server and onto the Web client--that is, to the computer on which the user is browsing the Web. Because of its basis in the Java system, a HotJava client can dynamically download segments of code that are executed right there on the client machine. Such Java-based "applets" (miniapplications) can provide full animation, play sound, and generally interact with the user in real time.
HotJava removes the static limitations of the Mosaic generation of Web browsers with its ability to add arbitrary behavior to the browser. Using HotJava, you can add applications that range from interactive science experiments in educational material, to games and specialized shopping applications. You can implement interactive advertising, customized newspapers, and a host of application areas that haven't even been thought of yet. The capabilities of a Web browser whose behavior can be dynamically updated are open-ended.
Furthermore, HotJava provides the means for users to access these applications in a new way. Software migrates transparently across the network as it's needed. You don't have to "install" software--it comes across the network as you need it--perhaps after asking you to pay for it. Content developers for the World-Wide Web don't have to worry about whether or not some special piece of software is installed in a user's system--it just gets there automatically. This transparent acquiring of applications frees content developers from the boundaries of the fixed media types such as images and text and lets them do whatever they'd like.
10.1.3 The Essential Difference
The central difference between HotJava and other browsers is that while these other browsers have knowledge of the Internet protocols hard-wired into them, HotJava understands essentially none of them. What it does understand is how to find out about things it doesn't understand. The result of this lack of understanding is great flexibility and the ability to add new capabilities very easily.

10
10.1.4 Dynamic Content
One of the most visible uses of HotJava's ability to dynamically add to its capabilities is something we call dynamic content. For example, someone could write a Java program to implement an interactive chemistry simulation, following the rules of the HotJava API. People browsing the net with HotJava could easily get this simulation and interact with it, rather than just having a static picture with some text. They can do this and be assured that the code that brings their chemistry experiment to life doesn't also contain malicious code that damages the system. Code that attempts to be malicious or which has bugs essentially can't breach the walls placed around it by the security and robustness features of Java.
HOTJAVA
HotJava is the coordinator of a federation of pieces, each with individual responsibility. New pieces can be added at any time. Pieces can be added from across the network, without needing to be concerned with what CPU architecture they were designed for and with reasonable confidence that the won't compromise the integrity of a user's system.
For example, the following is a snapshot of HotJava in use. Each diagram in the document represents a different sort algorithm. Each algorithm sorts an array of integers. Each horizontal line represents an integer: the length of the line corresponds to the value of the integer and the position of the line in the diagram corresponds to the position of the integer in the array.
87 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

10

In a book or HTML document, the author has to be content with these static illustrations. With HotJava the author can enable the reader to click on the illustrations and see the algorithms animate:

Using these dynamic facilities, content providers can define new types of data and behavior that meet the needs of their specific audiences, rather than being bound by a fixed set of objects.
10.1.5 Dynamic Types
HotJava's dynamic behavior is also used for understanding different types of objects. For example, most Web browsers can understand a small set of image formats (typically GIF, X11 pixmap, and X11 bitmap). If they see some other type, they have no way to deal with it. HotJava, on the other hand, can dynamically link the code from the host that has the image allowing it to display the new format. So, if someone invents a new compression algorithm, the inventor just has to make sure that a copy of its Java code is installed on

The HotJava World-Wide Web Browser

88

10

the server that contains the images they want to publish; they don't have to upgrade all the browsers in the world. HotJava essentially upgrades itself on the fly when it sees this new type.
The following is an illustration of how HotJava negotiates with a server when it encounters an object of an unknown type:

10.1.6 Dynamic Protocols
The protocols that Internet hosts use to communicate among themselves are key components of the net. For the World-Wide Web (WWW), HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the most important of these communication protocols. Within WWW documents, a reference to another document (even to a document on another Internet host computer) is called a URL, meaning a Uniform Resource Locator. The URL contains the name of the protocol, HTTP, that is used to find that document. Most of the current generation of Web browsers

89 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

10

have the knowledge of HTTP built-in. Rather than having built-in protocol handlers, HotJava uses the protocol name to link in the appropriate handler as required, allowing new protocols to be incorporated dynamically.
Dynamic incorporation of protocols has special significance to how business is done on the Internet. Many vendors are providing new Web browsers and servers with added capabilities, such as billing and security. These capabilities most often take the form of new protocols. So each vendor comes up with their unique style of security (for example) and sells a server and browser that speak this new protocol.
Without dynamic protocols, a user would need multiple browsers to access data on multiple servers if each of those servers had proprietary new protocolss. Such a situation is incredibly clumsy and defeats the synergistic cooperation that makes the World-Wide Web work.

Protocol handlers get installed in a sequence similar to how content handlers get installed: The HotJava Browser is given a reference to an object (a URL). If the handler for that protocol is already loaded, it will be used. If not, the HotJava Browser will search first the local system and then the system that is the target of the URL.
10.2 Freedom to Innovate
Innovation on the Internet follows a pattern: initially, someone develops a technology. They're free to try all kinds of things since no one else is using the technology and there are no compatibility issues. Slowly, people start using it, and as they do, compatibility and interoperability concerns slow the pace of innovation. The Internet is now in a state where even simple changes that everyone agrees will have significant merit are very hard to make.
User Population
Ability to innovate
Time
Within a community that uses HotJava, individuals can experiment with new facilities while at the same time preserving compatibility and interoperability. Data can be published in new formats and distributed using new protocols and the implementations of these will be automatically and safely installed. There is no upgrade problem. One need not be inventing new things to need these facilities. Almost all organizations need to be able to adapt to changing requirements. The HotJava browser's flexibility can greatly aid that. As new protocols and data types become important, they can be transparently incorporated.
91 The Java Language Environment--May 1996

10

10.3 Implementation Details
The basic structure of HotJava is instructive. It is easiest understood from the operation of Mosaic: Mosaic starts with a URL and fetches the object referenced by that URL using the specified protocol. The host and localinfo fields are passed to the protocol handler. The result of this is a bag of bytes containing the object that has been fetched. These bytes are inspected to determine the type of the data (HTML document or JPEG image, for example). From this type information, code is invoked to manipulate and view the data.
That's all there is to Mosaic. It's essentially very simple. But despite this apparent simplicity, the Mosaic program is actually huge since it must contain specialized handlers for all of these data types. It's bundled together into one big monolithic lump.
In contrast, HotJava is very small, because all of the protocol and data handlers are brought in from the outside. For example, when it calls the protocol handler, instead of having a table that has a fixed list of protocols that it understands, HotJava instead uses this type string to derive a Java language class name. The protocol handler for this type is dynamically linked in if it is missing. They can be linked in from the local system, or they can be linked in from definitions stored on the host where the URL was found, or anywhere else on the net that HotJava suspects might be a good place to look. In a similar fashion, HotJava can dynamically locate and load the code to handle different types of data objects and different ways of viewing them.

10.4 Security

Network security is of paramount importance to Internet users, especially with the exponential growth of Internet commerce. Network-based applications must be able to defend themselves against a veritable gallimaufry of network viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other forms of intruders. This section discusses the layers of defense provided by Java, the Java run-time system, and the higher-level protocols of HotJava itself.
One of the most important technical challenges in building a system like HotJava is making it secure. Downloading, installing, and executing fragments of code imported from across the network is potentially an open invitation to all sorts of problems. On the one hand, such a facility provides great power that can be used to achieve very valuable ends; on the other hand, the facility could potentially be subverted to become a breeding ground for computer

10
viruses. The topic of safety is a very broad one and doesn't have a single answer. HotJava has a series of facilities that layer and interlock to provide a fairly high degree of safety.
10.4.1 The First Layer--the Java Language Interpreter
The first layer of security in Java applications come from the ground rules of Java itself. These features have been described in detail in previous chapters in this paper.
When HotJava imports a code fragment, it doesn't actually know whether or not the code fragment follows Java language rules for safety. As described earlier, imported code fragments are subjected to a series of checks, starting with straightforward tests that the format of the code is correct and ending with a series of consistency checks by the Bytecode Verifier.
10.4.2 The Next Layer--the Higher Level Protocols
Given this base set of guarantees that interfaces cannot be violated, higher level parts of the system implement their own protection mechanisms. For example, the file access primitives implement an access control list that controls read and write access to files by imported code (or code invoked by imported code). The defaults for these access control lists are very restrictive. If an attempt is made by a piece of imported code to access a file to which access has not been granted, a dialog box pops up to allow the user to decide whether or not to allow that specific access.
10.5 HotJava--the Promise
The HotJava Web browser, based upon the foundations of the Java environment, brings a hitherto unrealized dynamic and interactive capability to the World-Wide Web. Dynamic content, dynamic data types, and dynamic protocols provide content creators with an entirely new tool that facilitates the burgeoning growth of electronic commerce and education.
The advent of the dynamic and interactive capabilities provided by the HotJava Web browser brings the World-Wide Web to life, turning the Web into a new and powerful business and communication tool for all users.
