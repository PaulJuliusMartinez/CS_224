A phenomenological calculation of the static and dynamic properties of orthorhombic antiferromagnets, with effective fields that satisfy the relations HA, H0 -(2HE, is carried out by taking into account two "bilinear" and three "biquadratic" anisotropy constants. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between the experimentally determined and the calculated orientational dependence of the antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) fields in YFe03 at T=300'K and v= 128 GHz. Consideration is given to a critical point of phase transitions of the second kind, at which the phase transition with respect to the field is characterized by an infinite discontinuity of the differential susceptibility while the magnetic moment changes continuously (a phase transition of the "one-and-one-halfth kind"). An experimental investigation of the dependence of the differential susceptibility on field and temperature justifies the supposition that such a transition exists in SmFe03·

1. INTRODUCTION
THE dependence of antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) frequencies on the value of the magnetic field and on its orientation, in orthoferrites and in compounds of the orthorhombic syngony related to them, has been investigated in recent years in a whole series of laboratories[ i-s]; and this work has led to an understanding of the basic characteristics of the effect of various interactions on the magnetostatics and the linear magnetodynamics of these systems. Thus observation of AFMR in TmFeOJ near the temperature of reorientation of the AF- vecto:rl: 1J and interpretation of these resultsC 2'3J have revealed the important role of the "second" anisotropy constants (which, by analogy with "biquadratic" exchangeC6 J, we shall call the "biquadratic" anisotropy constants). The effect of biquadratic anisotropy on the statics of orthoferrites in small fields, near the reorientation region, has been investigated in considerable detail[?-lo]. Recent precision measurements of the static magnetic properties of YFeOJ in strong fields and related calculations made by Jacobs, Burne, and Levinson[uJ , as well as available quantitative static characteristics of rare-earth orthoferrites (for example, SmFeOP2'13J), show that allowance for biquadratic anisotropy is necessary for consistent description of the experimental data even far from the reorientation temperatures (or in the absence of any, as in YFeOJ). For the purpose of explaining the effect of biquadratic anisotropy on the magnetostatics and dynamics of orthoferrites over a range of temperatures not necessarily close to the reorientation region, we have investigated AFMR in YFeOJ and SmFe03 and the temperature dependence of the value of the phase-transition field in SmFeOJ. In our phenomenological calculation of the static and dynamic properties of orthoferrites, for
«a broad range of values of the external field H 2HE
and for arbitrary orientation of it in the (ac) plane of the crystal, biquadratic anisotropy has been taken into account in a form corresponding to symmetry requirements (as was done also by Belov and othersCsJ in their analysis of the phenomenon of reorientation in SmFeOJ).

2. BASIC EQUATIONS

We use the two- sublattice model of an antiferromagnetic orthoferrite belonging to space group D~h- We write the magnetic energy of the system at temperature
T (sufficiently low in comparison with TN), and for ar-
bitrary orientation of the external field H in the (ac)
plane (the most interesting case), in the form

(M1 + ~)/2MT and l = (M1- ~)/2MT are the

M1 and M2 are the magnetic moments of the sublattices; MT is their value at the given temperature T, such that

steds (gausses). Y2 E and D are the effective symmetric

are satisfied; these significantly facilitate the calculation for an arbitrary type of anisotropy, since because of them, by analogy to the situation in hematiteE15J, the
parameter m « l ~ 1 is small over the whole field
range of practical interest, from zero to H ~ (AE) 112 or H ~ AE/D. This fact permits us, in writing the anisotropy energy, to restrict ourselves to terms containing only components of the AF-vector l. The specific results obtained below are valid also under the more general condition

/A/, D~E.

(3a)

We find the stationary state (m0 , lo) and the resonance
= =frequencies for small oscillations of the quantities
j.L m - mo, A l - lo from the equations of motion for m and l; these automatically take account of the conditions (2):
y-·ffi = -[mHw]-[IHI], y-·i = -[mHI]-[IHm];
Hm == -a;J(J I am, H, == -a;J(J I at.

3. THE STATIC CASE

Taking account of conditions (3), we get for m0 and lo (see Fig. la)

= (m, m, cos <p, 0, m, sin <p), I, :::::: (sin cp, 0, -cos <p),

(5)

where the functions cp(H, 8) and mo(H, 8) are given by the equations
+ = t[D H cos(<p- 8) ]H sin (cp- B) E (A. sin'<p A. cos'<p)sin<p cos <p,

Here and below we use the notation

==A,== c, +f-a,- a, -A,, A,== a,+ a,, A. == c, + c,- a,- j, A,== c, + c,.

(6c)

We shall introduce at once the following quantities,

which are convenient for what is to follow:

H..... 112[-D+(D'+4EA.)'i·], i.e. H.'+DH.==EA.; (7a)

H, == 112[ -D +(D' + 4EA,)Y·], i.e. H/ + DH, == EA,; (7b)

We shall consider below only systems with initial

temperatures below the reorientation range. To facilitate the obtaining of numerical values of A0 and Aa from static measurements, we note that in using the results of Jacobs and others[u] it is necessary to set Ao "' Hka
- 2Hk4' Aa"' Hk2" From (6a, b) follow the well-known results shown in
Fig. lb. Here

2MT IE= Xm. D = O'o I Xm, EA, = ao' I X1Xm,

(8)

where Xm and Xz are the initial susceptibilities along the original directions of the ferro- and antiferromagnetic vectors (that is, in the case of YFe03 , along the axes [c] and [a] respectively).

4. DYNAMICS

Equations (4) are the starting point for a standard

calculation of the resonance frequencies of the systems

under consideration, for arbitrary value of the field H

and for arbitrary orientation 8 of the field in the (ac)

plane. The result can be expressed in a form quite

convenient for analysis or for calculation. The two

AFMR frequencies w1,2(H, 8) are determined by the

equation

+({J)/y)'- (U V) (w/y)' +(UV- W)= 0;

(9a)

where
+U""' HEm, -E(Ao sin''JJ +A. cos' cp)cos 2<p 2EA,sin'<p cos'<p,

(9d)

The values of cp and mo as functions of H and 8 are given by equations (6a, 6b). It follows from the expressions (6) and (9) that for complete description of the static behavior of the system, two combinations (A0 and Aa) of the five anisotropy constants involved are sufficient, whereas the dynamics requires four: Ao, Aa, Ax, and Az. This shows up even in the easily calculated special
cases: for e "' 7T/2 and H « E,

'Jl=rr/2, (w,/y)'=H'+DH+EA,,
+(w, /y)' = D' DH- EAx;

+q> = 0; - (,ro, I"')' = H' DH- EA,
(ro,ly)'=D'+DH-EA,.

(lOb)

For quantitative determination of Ax and Az, it is
necessary to measure w20 and w2a (see Fig. lc); in actual materials, these as a rule lie in the hard- toreach submillimeter range. In general, the values of
Ax and Az affect also the values of Wt for 0 < H < Ha;
but as is shown by a numerical calculation that we have made by means of (9), this effect, which reaches a maximum at cp ~ 45°, is very small. For example, for ma-
terials of the type of YFe03, the difference in w1 at H ~ 50 kOe, for Ax:::::: Az equal to -7.5 kOe and to -15 kOe, does not exceed 1%.

5. ANALYSIS OF SPECIAL CASES

In strong fields (H ~ Ha) parallel to the initial (at
H = 0) direction of the AF-vector, it follows from (6a)

that a phase transition occurs from the '' xz- phase''

(in which, for H '¢ 0, both the x- and the z- components

of the AF-vector are nonzero) to the "z-phase", in

which the AF-vector is directed strictly. along the z
axis, while mx0 =(D +H)/E. This transition, depending
on the relation between the magnitudes of the different

interactions, may be a transition of the second or of the

first kind (with respect to the field). To find this rela-
tion, we set e = 0 in (6a), denote cos cp by ?; , and obtain

for H

+ + +H = {-D [D' 4E(A, A,~')~'l'''} I 2~.

(11)

It is easy to show (by analyzing, by means of (6a), the
behavior of the differential susceptibility Xx = dmx/dH at e = 0) that the nature of the transition is determined
by the sign of the derivative dH/d?; at the point (H = Ha, ?; = 1), through which the curve H( ?;) necessarily passes

by virtue of the definition (7a) of the quantity Ha. In calculating this derivative, we shall introduce the quan-

tity Aa (in general temperature-dependent), whose sign coincides with the sign of the derivative under consid-

eration:

== +A,(T} 1I2DH, EA, ""'H)+ 'j,DH,- EA,.

(12)

Then by use of the equation of state (6a) and the results
of the calculation of the dynamics of the system, we
arrive at the following conslusions.
a) Aa > 0, 8 = 0. The transition xz- z is a transi-
tion of the seco_?d kind and occurs at field 'Ht = Ha. As
parameter of the transition we may take the angle cp
(or lx0), which for 0 :o; H :o; Ha is determined by equation (11). Near the critical field, this parameter depends on
the field in the typical fashion

ent lxo does not vanish for any values of H. Consequently, in the (Hx, Hz) plane the point (Ha, 0) is an isolated phase- transition point of the second kind (with respect to the field). Near this point there occurs a characteristic relationship (see Fig. lc). Thus for
small e « 1, on expanding the formal function 8(Ha, cp) «in a series of powers of cp 1 by means of (6a), we get

+t:r(H,, e);:::::; [H,(H. D)e 1A.l'"·

(15)

Similar cube-root dependences are encountered in the

investigation of other isolated phase-transition points

of the second kind (for example, in the (T, H) plane at
T = Tc in ferromagnets, or at T = TN in antiferromag-

nets with weak ferromagnetism, where l (TN, H )

~ Hl/3. see[l7])

yo x

X' ·
The range of fields H and angles e near the point

(Ha, 0) is of particular interest from the experimental

point of view, since the AF:MR frequencies necessary for

observation in this range are not too high. The field and

orientation dependences of the lower AF:MR frequency

=near this point can be obtained by expanding the func-
tions e and w~ as series in h H - Ha « Ha and in «cp 1 by means of the general relations (6) and (9) (see

Fig. lc):

(16d)

The last expression gives the limiting angle 8w of inclination of the magnetic field to the direction of the easy axis of the crystal (in the (ac) plane), beyond which observation of AF:MR at a given frequency w becomes impossible (if the resonance line is infinitely sharp). In an actual case with allowance for finite complex susceptibilities (see[taJ), "fade-out" of the absorption is
delayed until slightly larger angles.
c) Aa < 0. In this case, fore = 0, the transition
xz- z occurs as a transition of the first kind at field Ht (see Fig. 2). The angle cp changes discontinuously at this field from 'Pt to zero. Other characteristics of the
system also undergo discontinuous changes. It can be shown that, by analogy to the situation in hematiteCtsJ,

field after instability, H< 1J, is determined by the condi-

The dependence of the AF:MR frequencies on the value
of the field, as follows from formulas (9a-d) fore = 0,
differs slightly (at small H) from that obtained by
CinaderC 16J; it is depicted in Fig. lc. We note again the
characteristic points of this figure (see also (10)):

tion dH/dl; = 0 (see (11)), and the transition field Ht is determined from the condition that the difference of energies of the two phases shall vanish at the transition point:

J'6"'- ;)', = 0.

d) For answering the question of the kind of transi-
tion, practical use of the parameter Aa described in the
form (12) is not altogether convenient. Experimentally,
it is easy to measure the values of ao, Xm' x , and the
transition field Ht (which is not equal to Had Aa < 0). It therefore makes sense to introduce the quantity

(18)

which in general is larger than or equal to the quantity
Aa (see (12), (8), and (17)). Then Aexp > 0 will be the

criterion for a transition of the second kind (in this case Ht = Ha and Aexp =A a), whereas Aexp < 0 will be the criterion for a transition of the first kind (since in this case Aa< 0 because Aa< Aexp) 1J.

The possibility is not excluded that there might be a crystal in which, at a certain temperature Tb, the parameter Aa(T) vanishes: Aa(Tb) = 0. This limiting case is curious, since for T = Tb the field-induced phase transition xz - z possesses properties in a certain sense intermediate between those of phase transitions of the second and of the first kind. In accordance with the definition introduced in the book of Landau and Lifshitz[19J, Tb is a critical point of phase transitions of the second kind. We shall consider this case in somewhat greater detail.

(here f!T(T) is a definite function of the effective fields). Under conditions that permit neglect of the terms
containing cp\ and for Aa > 0, it is easy to derive the
relations (13), (15), and (16) given above. They describe an isolated point of phase transition of the second kind. The corresponding relations for Aa = 0 have the form

q;(H.O):=::: [ 8(2H3D. +HD. ) (H.-H])''·, ~p(H.,6):=::: [ 8(H.3+DD) 6] ''·,

Thus at T = Tb, when Aa = 0, the point (Ha, 0) in the (Hx, Hy) plane is, as before, an isolated point of phase transition, at which the transition parameter cp, with increase of field, tends continuously toward zero at the transition field Ht = Ha; but its approach to zero from the smaller-field side occurs not along a parabola, but along a curve (Ha- H) 114· Therefore, although the magnetic moment mx of the system (a quantity proportional

to the first derivative of the thermodynamic potentials with respect to the field) also undergoes no discontinuity at H = Ha, the differential susceptibility dmx/dH becomes infinite at this field (from the low- field side), whereas in an ordinary transition of the second kind it should experience only a finite jump. This intermediate situation characterizes a so- called critical point of phase transitions of the second kind (in our case, in the (H, T) plane; seeC19J). By analogy with[2oJ we may, for brevity, call this transition with respect to the field when A = 0 a phase transition of the "one-and-onehalfth kind" (see Fig. 2). By using the results of paragraphs b), c), and e) of this section, one can show that in accordance with the general theorf19J, the Ht(T) curve undergoes a discontinuity of the second derivative at the point T = Tb.
6. ANTIFERROMAGNETIC RESONANCE IN YFeOa AND SmFe03
a) Apparatus. We have investigated the absorption of microwave radiation, of wavelengths .\ ~ 2, 4, 6, and 8 mm, in monocrystals of YFe03 (TN= 644°K) and of SmFe03 (TN= 674°K), as a function of the value of the field and of its orientation with respect to the crystalline axes, by means of a reflection radiospectrometer, with a pulsed magnetic field (Hmax = 300 kOe; duration of the field, from zero to zero, Too ~ 10 msec). The specimen being investigated was placed near the shorted end of a waveguide insert, on a circular table of diameter 2. 5 mm, whose surface formed part of the inner surface of the wide wall of a waveguide of 8- millimeter range. Rotation of the table about a horizontal axis was accomplished by means of a worm gear that insured an accuracy of setting of the angle of rotation no worse than 20' of arc. The whole waveguide insert, of length about 500 mm, was fastened on the Dewar cap, which could be moved along a cylindrical surface. The horizontal axis of this surface went through the center of the specimen and made a right angle with the axis of rotation of the table. The maximum possible angle of inclination of the waveguide insert to the vertical axis (which coincided with the axis of the pulsed solenoid) was 4o; the accuracy of setting of the angle was no worse than 10'.
b) Specimens. A monocrystal of YFe03 was kindly provided to us by the Semiconductor Institute, Academy of Sciences, USSR (Leningrad); it belonged to the same group of specimens as those used by Yudin and others others[21 J. The monocrystal of samarium orthoferrite used for resonance measurements was grown by the method of crucibleless zone fusion with radiation heatingC22J. The content of iron of various valences was monitored according to the sharpness of the edge of the window of transparency in the infrared part of the spectrum. Practially all the iron was in the trivalent state. The absorption coefficient (a) at wavelength 1.2 microns was 12 cm-1· The SmFe03 monocrystal on which the measurements of differential susceptibility were made was grown from a solution (oxides of the rare earth in oxides of lead and boron) in the melt; it was kindly provided to us by J. Marechal (France). All specimens had approximately the shape of a cube of edge about 3 mm. The critical fields of the SmFe03 specimens, measured dynamically (by AFMR) and quasistatically (by the dif-

The fastening of the specimens to the table was per-

for~ed in a constant magnetic field, in such a way that

the1r spontaneous magnetic moment (and consequently

the axis [c] for YFe03 and the axis [a] for SmFe03) was

perpendicular to the surface of the table. The funda-

mental measurements of the orientational dependence

of the resonance fields were made by rotation of the

waveguide insert without change of the position of the

specimen with respect to the waveguide.

c) Results. Figure 3 shows the orientational (in the

ac plane) dependence of the values of the magnetic field

at which maxima of the absorption of microwave energy
occur in YFe03, with frequency v = 128 GHz. At room

temperature, the width 6H of each of the two resonance

lines, when the field was oriented strictly along the axis
[a], that is when 8 = oo (± 10'), was 1.5 ± 0.5 kOe. With

inclination of the field to the axis [a] , the lines draw

closer together, and at 8~xp = 1. 5o they are almost com-

pletely fused. In the angle interval 1.5 to 2.5°, a single

absorption maximum is observed; its intensity dimin-

ishes with increase of 18 I and vanishes for 18 1 ~ 2,5°.

maximum is observed; according to[la], it is a field-

dependent absorption at the edge of the line belonging to

the real branch w1(H) of the AFMR. This maximum at
8 = 0 occurs at the phase-transition field Ht, the meas-

ured value of which (with absolute error± 2.5 kOe), at

300°K, is shown in Fig. 3.
In SmFe03 at 300°K and 8 =0, at frequency 129 GHz,

two wide (6H ~ 6 kOe) lines are observed, at field

values 46 and 60.5 kOe; with increase of the disorienta-

tion angle 8, they begin to draw closer together, but

more slowly than in YFe03. The resolution is main-
tained up to 8 = 4o.

d) Discussion. The phenomenological calculation

made above enables us to describe the experimental re-

suits quantitatively with sufficient accuracy (for YFe03,

the better, the closer to oo K). By using the data on

static measurements available in the literature [u,21, 12J

our data for the transition fields, and the deductions of '

Section 5, we construct the following table:

Use of the experimental data of Gorodetsky and othersC 9J

for YFe03 gives the same values of 8 calc.

There can be no doubt that in YFeiS3 at both tempera-
tures, what occurs at field H = Ht is a phase transition

of the second kind (at 8 = 0, of course). The availability

of sufficiently accurate static data enables us not only

to calculate the limiting angle 8w (by formula (16d)), but

also to construct, for fixed operating frequency w, the

whole curve of the orientational dependence 8(h) of the

resonance fields; this is easily obtained by eliminating
the variable cp from equations (19a, b) for P = Q = 0.

This construction has been made in Fig. 3. The dotted

part of the curves corresponds to values of cp for which

the condition cp ~ 1 is poorly satisfied, and therefore

neglect of the terms containing P and Q in (19a, b) is not

legitimate.

6, and 8 mm in YFe03, even when the field was oriented

along the axis [a] with the greatest accuracy possible in our apparatus (8 ~ 10'), is easily explained by the

strong frequency dependence of the value of the splitting

sharpness of the resonance lines of the specimens in-

vestigated. For SmFe03, a quantitative interpretation of

the orientation curve is very difficult. The absence of

sufficiently accurate static data makes it impossible to

estimate the basic parameter of the problem ' Aexp' with reasonable accuracy. An attempt to calculate Aexp (see Table) from the data of Belov and collaborators[12] 1eads to a relati.vely small value for it. Ex-

pression (16d)-in which, for application to the case of
SmFe03 at T =300°K, it is sufficient to replace Ha by

He and Aa by Ac-shows that the value of the limiting

angle 8w increases with decrease of A . Therefore the

significantly different character of thecorientation curve

in SmFe03 as compared with YFe03 (see Table) agrees

qualitatively with theory.

7. PHASE TRANSITION WITH RESPECT TO FIELD IN SmFe03
In samarium orthoferrite at H = 0 and at temperatures from OoK to the reorientation range (TR R< 480°K), the configuration 1 II (c], m 11 [a] exists. In a field
H II (c] , there is completed at H = Ht a "quasiflop of
the sublattices", that is a phase transition xz - x. The value of Ht, as follows from the experiments of Belov and collaborators[ 12J, in small static fields depends strongly on temperature. It seemed of interest to follow the dependence Ht(T) to lower temperatures. We did

FIG. 4. The results of induction measurements of the field and temperature dependence of the differential susceptibility of SmFe03 point to a change of character of the phase transition with lowering of the temperature.
FIG. 5. Temperature dependence of the value Ht[cl of the xz ~ x phase-transition field in SmFe03 , according to measurements of the differential susceptibility. There is a similar temperature variation of the value of the AFMR field for v = 37 GHz and H II [c].

this on the monocrystalline specimen of SmFe03 described above: at various temperatures from 1. 7 to 300°K, we measured by the induction method the dependence of the differential susceptibility along the axis [c] on the value of the pulsed field.
The results of analysis of the oscillograms are shown for several temperatures in Fig. 4. Besides the expected increase of Ht with lowering of temperature, one notices the abrupt change of character of the behavior of x[CJ (H) near Ht at the lowest temperatures. The increase in the height of the peak in x[c J and its abrupt contraction permit us to state that the phase transition xz - x at field Ht changes from continuous to discontinuous with respect to the magnetic moment. The fact that a similar transformation of the character of the transition occurs on approach to the "compensation point" of SmFe03 (see 23]; Tcomp ~ 4.2°K) is not sur-
prising. At the compensation point, the assumed absence of a spontaneous magnetic moment makes the phase transition under discussion similar to the classical flop of sublattices in pure antiferromagnets, which is known to be a transition of the first kind. The transition must remain discontinuous also in a certain inter-
val above Tcomp· until at a certain T = Tb the jump in
the magnetic moment at field Ht decreases to zero. Thus this temperature Tb separates the regions of phase transitions of the first and of the second kinds
with respect to the field. Right at T = Tb, the transition
with respect to the field may possess the features of the phase transition of the "one-and-one-halfth kind" discussed in Sec. 5. The form of the temperature dependence Ht(T) for SmFe03, shown in Fig. 5, is still another argument in favor of this deduction, since at some temperature near 4.2°K the value of d2Ht/dT2 , in accordance with the prediction of the theory, undergoes a discontinuity (or at least changes abruptly). For determination of the specific value of Tb and, in particular, of its difference from Tcomp· and also for quantita-
tive analysis of the phenomenon (calculation of A and of the jump in d2Ht/dT2 at T = Tb), we are undertaking to improve appreciably the accuracy of the measurements.

8. CONCLUSIONS
Phenomenological calculation of the statics and dynamics of orthorhombic antiferromagnets, with inter-
actions subject to the conditions IAI, D « E, with allow-
ance for bilinear and biquadratic anisotropy in a form corresponding to the requirements of the crystal symmetry, enables us to obtain convenient expressions for qualitative and quantative analysis of the properties of antiferromagnets of this class. For a complete quantitative description of the statics of these materials, two combinations (Aa and Ac) of the five anisotropy constants involved are sufficient; but description of the linear dynamic properties requires introduction of two additional combinations (Ax and Az)- The kind of magnetic phase transition (with respect to the field) that occurs at a certain value of the magnetic field, parallel to the axis that is easy for the AF-vector ([a] or [c] outside the reorientation region), is determined by the sign of the parameter Aexp· which is made up of experi-
mentally measured magnetic characteristics of the
crystal (see (18)): for Aexp > 0, the transition is of the
second kind; for Aexp < 0, it is of the first kind. In the
case A > 0, the orientational dependence of the reson-
ance fields near the isolated point of phase transition of the second kind in the (Hx, Hz) plane can be described by relatively simple expressions, which are convenient for predicting the results of dynamic measurements for most orthoferrites.
