ABSTRACT: Our understanding of the effects of ocean acidification on whole organism function is growing, but most current information is for adult stages of development. Here, we show the effects of reduced pH seawater (pH 7.6) on aspects of the development, physiology and behaviour of encapsulated embryos of the marine intertidal gastropod Littorina obtusata. We found reduced viability and increased development times under reduced pH conditions, and the embryos had significantly altered behaviours and physiologies. In acidified seawater, embryos spent more time stationary, had slower rotation rates, spent less time crawling, but increased their movement periodicity compared with those maintained under control conditions. Larval and adult heart rates were significantly lower in acidified seawater, and hatchling snails had an altered shell morphology (lateral length and spiral shell length) compared to control snails. Our findings show that ocean acidification may have multiple, subtle effects during the early development of marine animals that may have implications for their survival beyond those predicted using later life stages.

INTRODUCTION
By the end of this century the pH of surface seawater is predicted to decrease by 0.5 units, due to the increase of carbonic acid formed when CO2 is absorbed by the ocean (Caldeira & Wicket 2003, Feely et al. 2004). Over the next few centuries this pH decline could reach 0.8 to 1.4 units (Royal Society 2005), causing the oceans to become less alkaline than they have been for the last 55 million years (Zachos et al. 2005).
Early indications of the potential impact that ocean acidification may have on marine ecosystems suggest that effects could be complex, with organisms responding directly (e.g. Przeslawski et al. 2005) and indirectly (e.g. Bibby et al. 2007) to the chemical change in their environment. Different organismal groups may demonstrate differing levels of vulnerability to the change in oceanic chemistry (HallSpencer et al. 2008, Widdicombe & Spicer 2008). For

example, effects may be disproportionately large for calcifying organisms, as in many cases calcification rates decrease linearly with increasing pCO2 (Gazeau et al. 2007), leading to reduced shell mineralization (e.g. Kurihara et al. 2007 although cf. Wood et al. 2008). Evidence is also growing of the diverse effects of CO2induced seawater acidification on whole organism function (Pörtner et al. 2004, Fabry et al. 2008, Widdicombe & Spicer 2008), ranging from impaired immunological function (e.g. Bibby et al. 2008) and extracellular acid ­base disruption (e.g. Michaelidis et al. 2005, Miles et al. 2007, Spicer et al. 2007) through to growth, reproduction (e.g. Michaelidis et al. 2005, Berge et al. 2006, Mayor et al. 2007) and ecosystem effects (Hall-Spencer et al. 2008).
Whilst our understanding of the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms is growing, most of this information is for late (i.e. postembryonic, predominantly sexually mature) stages of development

and little is known about effects early in ontogeny. Recent findings, however, suggest that earlier developmental stages of marine fish may be more sensitive to CO2-induced seawater acidification than those later in development (Ishimatsu et al. 2004). A similar pattern was found for the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, in which adult survival and egg production were unaffected by reduced seawater pH but egg development was reduced dramatically (Mayor et al. 2007). Other invertebrates also show a disruption of early development: fertilization, cleavage and overall development rates were all slower, and the pluteus larval stage was smaller in the sea urchins Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus and Echinometra methaei grown under elevated CO2 conditions (Kurihara et al. 2004, Kurihara & Shirayama 2004); additionally the morphology and shell mineralization of larvae of the oyster Crassostrea gigas were disrupted at pH 7.4 (Kurihara et al. 2007). The study of Kurihara et al. (2007) is the first invertebrate study that, by concentrating on the process of mineralization, begins to focus on a mechanistic developmental process that might be affected by reduced pH. Such processes are often key to understanding how the environment affects organism fitness (e.g. Spicer & El-Gamal 1999).
Here we investigate how ocean acidification affects developing embryos, using the intertidal gastropod Littorina obtusata. A direct developing gastropod, this species is ideal for observing development, including traits such as spinning activity and heart rates (S. Rundle et al. unpubl. data). We focussed on behavioural (percentage spinning/crawling time, movement rate and periodicity) and physiological (larval and adult heart activity) effects, but also measured total development time, hatching success, hatchling morphology and heart rate in order to infer potential links between egg viability, hatchling condition and the embryonic traits measured.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and maintenance of adult snails. Adult Littorina obtusata (N = 90) were collected by hand from the intertidal zone at Mount Batten, Plymouth, Devon, UK (50° 21.34' N, 04° 07.45' W) and Talland Bay, West Looe, Cornwall, UK (50° 20.21' N, 04° 29.78' W) during September 2007. Snails were transported to the laboratory within 1 h of harvest and immediately distributed between 6 aquaria (volume = 9 l, stocking density = 15 ind. aquarium­1) each containing aerated seawater (salinity = 35 PSU, temperature = 15 ± 0.5°C, filtered using a 10 carbon block filter [10 µm Matrikx]). All aquaria were subject to a 16 h light:8 h dark regime. Snails were fed ad libitum on Fucus serratus. Snails

were housed in collection batches, which were sorted by date, to ensure no effect of disturbance through addition of subsequently collected animals and to ensure all individual snails had equal acclimation time in the laboratory.
Egg laying occurred on algal fronds and was initiated by exposing snails to `dirty water' followed by a recovery period (e.g. Boyle & Yoshino 2000): after 5 daily water changes and constant aeration, aerated aquarium water was left unchanged and snails were left unfed for 72 h, followed by 36 h with no aeration; after this time water was renewed and aerated, and snails were given fresh Fucus serratus. Daily water changes were resumed until sufficient egg batches had been laid. This experimental method was demonstrated to induce oviposition in snails, which, when left to occur `spontaneously', does so at a rate that is unsuitable for large experimental manipulations (Boyle & Yoshino 2000).
Egg batch maintenance and seawater acidification. Fronds containing egg masses were removed from aquaria within 24 h of laying. Each mass (N = 9) was detached from the frond using a scalpel and divided into 2 equal halves (from now on these halves are referred to as batches). Each batch was then transferred to an experimental chamber (volume = 100 ml, polypropylene) with an aspirator supplying either air (untreated seawater) or air enriched with CO2 (acidified seawater), with a batch from each egg mass being allocated to 1 of each of the 2 treatments. Air treatments were prepared as follows: ambient air scrubbed with NaOH (2 mol l­1) was mixed with CO2 using adjustable airline gang valves (Algarde) to produce a nominal CO2 concentration of 1100 ppm (measured mean = 1093 ± 181 ppm). The resultant gas mixture was dried, and the CO2 content was measured using a CO2 analyzer (LI-700, Li-Cor) and then supplied to either (1) each of the experimental chambers, via an airline connected to a glass pipette inserted through the top of the experimental chamber, or (2) a reservoir tank (volume = 9 l) containing seawater, producing seawater at pH 7.6, which was used to replenish water in experimental chambers every 24 h. This procedure was replicated for the control treatment, except that the air was not scrubbed and CO2 was not added, which resulted in water through which this gas mixture was aspirated having a nominal pH of 8.1. The pH of experimental water was measured every 24 h (just prior to a complete change of seawater in experimental chambers) using a pH electrode (pH 209 meter, Hanna Instruments).
Embryo viability and hatching success. Every 24 h each egg batch was removed from its chamber, placed onto a scaled graticule slide (1 mm), immersed in chamber seawater, and imaged using a digital camera

(Nikon Coolpix 4500) mounted on an optical light microscope (Leica MZ12; Mazurek optical series, mag. ×8­50). Three images were taken of each egg batch daily, containing a minimum of 3, typically 10 to 20, haphazardly selected eggs. Egg viability was subsequently calculated, with imaged eggs being recorded as viable or non-viable, non-viable being those that were either deformed or twin (i.e. 2 egg capsule­1), as no embryo from either of these classes was observed to develop successfully. Viability was analysed up until the first hatching event, as, after this point in development, successful hatching would alter the visible numbers of viable eggs.
Each chamber was inspected every 24 h for hatchlings, which were then removed using a small brush. After appropriate physiological measurements had been made (see following subsection), hatchlings were collected using a pipette, counted, transferred to a glass vial and stored at ­20°C for subsequent morphological analysis (see following subsection).
Measuring physiological and behavioural traits of embryos. We measured embryo activity and selected aspects of physiological function throughout development in a subsample of 3 egg batches from each treatment. Embryo activity (as defined below) was quantified every 24 h from the fourth day post hatching (i.e. when spinning commenced, as prior to this point embryos remained stationary) using 5 min videos of 3 randomly selected eggs from within each of the 3 egg batches. These batches were placed on a slide immersed in seawater taken from their chambers and videoed for 5 min d­1. Digital video imaging was produced using a motion camera (Pixera Corporation) mounted upon a light microscope coupled to a PC (Pixera Motion v.2.1). Videos were recorded at a magnification of ×40 to 100 depending on the stage of development and were analysed to determine embryo behaviour. Several behavioural measures were employed based on the cilia-driven rotation, spinning, movements observed in early stage gastropod embryos (e.g. Diefenbach et al. 1991) and the crawling activity exhibited later in development (e.g. Smirthwaite et al. 2007), including: (1) the percentage of time embryos spent stationary, spinning, or crawling; (2) the spinning rate of embryos, recorded as rotations per minute (RPM); and (3) the periodicity of embryo movement, being the total number of both stationary (inactive) and motile (active) periods, highlighting how often embryos switched from stationary to active motion, or active to stationary, during a recording period. Spinning activity is of particular interest due to its proposed function in mixing of cellular fluids increasing embryo environmental oxygen delivery (Goldberg et al. 2008); embryo rotational behaviour is also linked to early neural development (Diefenbach et al. 1991), and, hence, its

disruption could indicate effects on the embryonic nervous system.
As well as measuring the activity of the adult heart (beats min­1), which appears and begins to function midway through embryonic development, we also quantified the activity of the `larval heart'. This extracardiac structure, which is linked with perfusion of the velum and has a presumed circulatory function, appears before the adult heart, disappearing once the adult heart has been established (Fretter & Graham 1962). Larval and adult heart activities were quantified every 24 h throughout development, from the day that each respective organ began to function. In this case direct counts were made from the same 3 egg batches from each treatment used for behavioural videos. Both larval and adult heart activities were measured separately in 3 randomly selected individuals from each egg batch every day for 1 min. In the case of the larval heart only, days where this structure remained fully functional in all recorded replicates, up to Day 21, were included in this analysis. Adult heart activity analysis only included days on which the adult heartbeat was established in all individuals (i.e. from 17 d). The area of the velum was also measured throughout development using imageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
Hatchling morphology and heart beat. Aspects of the physiology and morphology of post-hatch juvenile snails were quantified to determine whether the embryonic developmental environment might have affected this later stage of development. Firstly, the adult heart activity (the larval heart was not present at this stage) was measured manually for 60 s for the first 5 hatchling individuals from 3 egg batches in each treatment.
Hatchling morphology was measured in 5 individuals from each of the last 3 egg batches to be laid in each treatment (N = 30), photographed in the same way as were embryos. Eight measures were obtained: lateral shell length, ventral shell length, ventral shell width (spire height), aperture length, aperture width (widest), lateral shell mid-length, spiral length and aperture area (Fig. 1).
Statistical analysis. All data were analysed using MINITAB 15. First, data were transformed when necessary, including log10(x + 1) (hatchling duration, hatchling number, movement periodicity and rate, larval, adult and hatchling heartbeat) and arcsine (percentage of time spent stationary, spinning or crawling) transformation. Two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs), using the general linear model, were then used to investigate the effects of developmental time, pH and their interaction on all traits observed during development. On finding a significant interaction, post hoc Tukey tests were used to assess pairwise differences between the treatments on specific

days throughout development, indicating at which point during development the treatment has a significant effect. Differences in hatchling morphology, hatchling heart rate and development duration between the control and low pH treatment were investigated using 1-way ANOVA.
RESULTS
Embryo viability and hatching success
There was a clear effect of acidified seawater on the viability of Littorina obtusata embryos. During development, percentage egg viability in untreated seawater remained > 96% until the first hatching event on Day 24. In acidified seawater, however, percentage viability fell to < 94% after Day 6 and declined further to 88% by Day 7, remaining between 81 and 88% from Day 12 through 24 (Fig. 2). The cumulative number of hatchlings was lower in acidified seawater (N = 449) compared with the number in the control (N = 575) (Fig. 3), and mean duration of development was significantly longer in the acidified treatment group (mean ± SE: 27.5 ± 0.1 d) compared with the duration in the control (26.9 ± 0.05 d) (ANOVA, F1,1022 = 56.29, p > 0.001).

reduced crawling (Fig. 4c, Table 1). There was also a significant interaction between development time and pH for the percentage of time spent crawling (Fig. 4c, Table 1); post hoc analysis indicated a significant difference between treatments 22 d into development. In contrast, there was no effect on the percentage of time spent spinning (Table 1), which occurred earlier in development than crawling (Days 7 to 20) (Fig. 4b). Spinning rate was also affected by pH, with embryos in acidified seawater rotating at a significantly reduced rate (Fig. 5, Table 2). Periodisation of embryo movement was greater in the acidified treatment (Fig. 6, Table 2).
Physiological measures from embryo
A functional larval heart appeared 12 d into development in both the control and reduced pH treatments, although the larval heart rate was significantly lower in acidified seawater (Fig. 7, Table 3). Adult heart activity was also significantly lower in acidified seawater (Fig. 7, Table 3).

Embryo activity
Embryos spent a significantly greater proportion of their time stationary in reduced pH compared with the control seawater (Fig. 4a, Table 1), which was due to

Heart rate was greater in hatchlings reared in reduced pH compared with those reared in untreated seawater, although this difference was not formally significant (ANOVA, F1, 56 = 3.49, p = 0.067).

Larval and adult heart function
The effect of reduced pH on both the larval and adult hearts of Littorina obtusata supports the idea that reduced pH may affect the metabolism of developing embryos. The fact that these activities were reduced under low pH conditions is at odds with any hypothesis that could be advanced in which metabolism is increased and oxygen levels decreased under low pH. To our knowledge the effect of environmental cues on larval heart function is unexplored, rendering comparisons with our work premature.

Embryo activity
During development, snails in acidified seawater spent less time crawling and, despite no reduction in the time spent spinning, their spinning rate was significantly reduced. Under acidified conditions the snails had short bursts of active motility interspersed with frequent stationary periods as opposed to prolonged active periods. All of the behavioural alterations we observed have been noted previously in embryonic snails (Moran 1999, Chaparro et al. 2002, Uyan & Aral 2003), but there was no previous information on the effects of CO2-induced low pH. The effect of CO2 on sexually mature stages usually led to a reduction in activity; for example, Batten & Bamber (1996) found a reduction in burrowing activity in adult polychaetes Nereis virens exposed to pH 7.5, although Widdicombe & Needham's (2007) study on the same species reported no CO2-related change in activity.
Why embryonic movement is affected by CO2 is unknown. Kuang et al. (2002) showed a dose-dependant and reversible increase in embryonic rotation rate with O2 concentration, with a hypoxia-related increase in rotation rate facilitating the mixing of intra-capsular fluid, facilitating O2 diffusion to the embryo. This mechanism has recently been termed the `embryo stir-bar hypothesis' (Goldberg et al. 2008), and it is pos-
sible that the alterations to activity we observed reflect a link between reduced pH and O2 in experimental animals, potentially through an indirect influence on metabolism.

length being shorter and the spiral shell length longer. Modification of shell shape in Littorina obtusata by abiotic factors such as predation have been recorded previously (Brookes & Rochette 2007), but this is the first time it has been documented for hatchlings and for snails cultured in acidified seawater. The extent to which these impacts and the observed decreased viability of embryos can be attributed to the behavioural and physiological responses of embryonic L. obtusata is not known. The cost of developing under acidified conditions for organisms at later life cycle stages should be a research priority. Such information would allow us to understand how any trade-offs imposed by a permanently reduced seawater pH will impact an organism's ecology and, ultimately, its fitness (Black 1993).

CONCLUSIONS

We demonstrate that ocean acidification may affect embryonic marine organisms in significant but subtle ways. Furthermore, such effects are observed at a level of seawater acidification (pH 7.6) predicted to occur over the next century. It is now of considerable interest to know the long-term costs (if any) of CO2related modifications in the development of this important intertidal species. Whether or not there are fitness implications from environmental challenges early in development is a key area of study in ecological and evolutionary biology (Mathis et al. 2008), the findings of which are critical for our understanding of the effect of ocean acidification on marine species and ecological communities. The ultimate goal, however, should be to try and factor the embryonic stage into long-term studies aiming to address whether marine invertebrates such as Littorina obtusata are likely to be able to adapt to the predicted changes in ocean chemistry.
