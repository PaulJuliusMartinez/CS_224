I. INTRODUCTION

O PTICAL transmission in long-haul fiber systems incorporating cascaded erbium-doped fiber amplifiers

(EDFAs) is limited by the accumulated amplified spontaneous

emission (ASE) noise. All-optical 2R regeneration using

passive saturable absorbers (SAs) is of interest as a means of

reducing the noise accumulation and extending the error-free

transmission distance [1].

Semiconductor SAs incorporating multiple-quantum wells

(MQWs) exhibit strong nonlinear absorption response to

optical power, as the photogenerated free-carrier population

builds up in the MQW region, resulting in an absorption

decrease when the input power increases above a threshold.

Overcoming the long (nanosecond) absorption recovery time

of such SAs by introducing defects in the MQW region via

low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy [2], high-energy ion

implantation [3], or Fe-doping [4] is required in order to make

such devices usable in high bit-rate transmission systems.

Improved system performance has been reported when fast SAs

were incorporated at the amplification points [5], [6], while

an increase in transmission distance from 1300 to 7600 km

for a BER

in a 40-Gb/s system was recently

demonstrated when the SA was combined with a nonlinear

fiber [7]. However, application of SAs in systems with long

spans of standard single-mode fiber (SMF) and conventional dispersion compensation has not yet been demonstrated. For 10-Gb/s transmission systems without regeneration operating at 1550 nm and incorporating dispersion compensated standard fiber with 75-km amplifier spacings, error-free transmission distances up to 2500 km have been demonstrated [8], [9].
Recently, we developed an MQW SA monolithically integrated in a Fabry­Pérot cavity and implanted with nitrogen ions at an energy of 4 MeV. By incorporating the SA in a 40-Gb/s system, we demonstrated ASE noise suppression on "zero" bits [10]. In this letter, we use the same device in combination with a nonlinear fiber and an optical filter to control amplitude fluctuations on "one" bits, thereby forming a 2R all-optical regenerator [11]. We demonstrate 10-Gb/s error-free transmission improvement to over 7000 km in a dispersion compensated SMF recirculating loop with an amplifier spacing of 80 km, when the 2R regenerator is included in the system.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM

The SA incorporates an MQW active layer formed by 50

InGaAsP

m quantum wells, separated by InGaAsP

m barriers, grown by metal­organic vapor phase

epitaxy (Fig. 1). To increase the contrast ratio, the device is op-

erated in reflection and the MQW layer is integrated in an asym-

metric Fabry­Pérot cavity [2], [12]. The cavity is formed by

the top air­semiconductor interface and a 16-period InGaAsP

m /InP distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). The de-

sign of the cavity requires that the front and the effective back

reflections interfere destructively at the wavelength of the MQW

excitonic absorption peak, when the input power is low. To sat-

isfy this condition, InP spacer layers are used above and below

the MQW, adjusting the optical path length through the SA to in-

duce a -phase shift of the back reflection compared to the front

reflection at the required wavelength. Under these conditions, if

the input power is increased, the MQW excitonic absorption is

bleached, and the back reflection becomes dominant, leading to

increased overall device reflectivity. By operating at normal in-

cidence, the device is made polarization insensitive.

To reduce the absorption recovery time of the SA, implan-

tation of nitrogen ions was performed at 4 MeV energy and

200 C temperature, using a dose of 3 10 cm . At this

energy, the ions pass through the MQW layer and stop in the

first layers of the DBR, as calculated using the simulation pro-

gram SRIM-2000 [13]. However, defects generated along the

ion traces act as photocarrier trapping and recombination cen-

ters, thereby reducing the absorption recovery time, while pre-

serving the nonlinear absorption of the MQW. A pump-probe

technique using 2-ps pulses at 4-MHz repetition rate was used

to measure the recovery time of the SA. The as-grown material

had a 1/e absorption recovery time of 3 ns, which was reduced to

less than 5 ps after implantation. Measurements of the transfer

function of the SA with input pulse energy at 4-MHz repetition

rate indicated a contrast ratio of 7.5 dB and an insertion loss of

10 dB (including circulator) when the SA was fully saturated,

while the saturation energy of the device was estimated to be

12 pJ.

Once saturated, the SA acts as a linear loss in the system, and

cannot reduce any amplitude fluctuations or noise accumulated

on "one" bits. In [11], Matsumoto et al. suggested the combi-

nation of an SA with a highly nonlinear fiber and a bandpass

filter, to form a 2R regenerator. Self-phase modulation in the

fiber results in pulse-compression, and energy equalization is

achieved by transmitting the pulses through an optical bandpass

filter. To complete the 2R regenerator, a 3-km span of TrueWave

RS fiber

ps/nm/km was used after the SA, followed by

an optical filter of 0.9-nm bandwidth.

The 2R regenerator was tested in a 10-Gb/s recirculating

loop. The experimental configuration is shown in Fig. 2. The

loop consists of 80 km of SMF

ps/nm/km , followed

by an EDFA and a dispersion compensation module (DCM) to compensate for the fiber loss (0.25 dB/km) and dispersion, respectively, while two acoustooptic modulators (AOMs) provide switching through a 3-dB coupler. The mean power at the input of the 80-km span is set to 1 dBm. The DCM consists of dispersion compensating fiber ( 1400 ps/nm), trimmed using 1.4-km SMF to minimize distortion of a 40-Gb/s eye after 15 recirculations around the loop without regeneration. The input power to the DCM was 1 dBm. The 10-Gb/s input signal consists of 6-ps (full-width at half-maximum) return-to-zero pulses at 1550 nm, modulated with a pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) data sequence.
The regenerator consists of two sections: The first section incorporates an EDFA, a 3-nm bandwidth optical filter and the SA, with 16.5-dBm power incident on the SA. The second section incorporates an EDFA that provides 10 dBm at the input of the nonlinear fiber, which is followed by the optical bandpass filter.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To evaluate the performance of the system without the re-

generator, a 3-nm bandwidth optical filter was used before the

AOM in the loop, to limit the accumulation of out-of-band ASE

noise and jitter in the transmission system as the number of re-

circulations increases. When the regenerator was added to the

system, the 3-nm bandwidth filter was bypassed, as indicated

by the dashed arrow in Fig. 2. The evolution of the factor

with distance was measured with and without the regenerator in

the system. Fig. 3 shows the experimental linear factor with

distance without and with regeneration in the system, for mod-

ulation with

PRBS and

PRBS data sequences.

The maximum error-free propagation distance ( factor 6)

for a

PRBS data sequence without noise suppression

was 2000 km. Adding the 2R regenerator in the system, an

error-free distance of 7280 km was achieved. The perfor-

mance of the system was also examined when the input signal

was modulated with a

IV. CONCLUSION

An ion-implanted MQW SA integrated in a Fabry­Pérot

cavity was combined with a nonlinear fiber and an optical filter

to form a 2R regenerator. The 2R regenerator was tested in a

10-Gb/s transmission system and an improvement by a factor

3.5 in the error-free transmission distance was demonstrated

for and

PRBS modulated signals. The MQW SA

is polarization insensitive, passive, and requires no postimplant

fabrication.

allows for longer sequences of consecutive "one" bits, which would degrade the system performance severely if the regenerator introduces strong patterning. Without the 2R regenerator, the factor degrades fast and error-free transmission is only achieved over 1600 km. When the regenerator is included in the system, the error-free transmission distance is increased to over 5840 km. The faster degradation of the factor in this case, compared to that for the shorter data sequence, is observed both without and with regeneration, and can be attributed to more intense jitter. It is interesting to note that for both lengths of PBRS, an improvement by a factor of 3.6 in transmission distance was achieved.
The electrical eye diagrams of the input signal and after 2000 km without and with the regenerator in the recirculating loop are shown in Fig. 4. At 2000 km, noise accumulation causes eye closure in the case without regeneration. A clear improvement is observed with the 2R regenerator in the system at similar distances, while the main system limitation as the transmission distance increases to 6480 km is timing jitter.
In order to explore the system enhancement through regeneration, we deliberately increased the loss per span and measured the factor at a distance of 3440 km. Initially, the optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measured after a single span was 30.5 dB (resolution bandwidth of 0.1 nm for the noise measurement), while the factor after 43 recirculations in the loop (3440 km) was 8.55. When the loss per span was increased by 2.8 dB, the optical SNR and factor were reduced to 28.5 dB and 6.2, respectively. The result shows that the interamplifier spacing could be increased to over 90 km while maintaining error-free transmission.
