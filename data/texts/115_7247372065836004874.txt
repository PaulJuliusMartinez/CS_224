Abstract
In many practical machine learning and data mining applications, unlabeled training examples are readily available but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain. Therefore, semi-supervised learning algorithms such as co-training have attracted much attention. Previous research mainly focuses on semi-supervised classification. In this paper, a co-training style semi-supervised regression algorithm, i.e. COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two k-nearest neighbor regressors with different distance metrics, each of which labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor where the labeling confidence is estimated through consulting the influence of the labeling of unlabeled examples on the labeled ones. Experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.
1 Introduction
In many practical machine learning and data mining applications such as web user profile analysis, unlabeled training examples are readily available but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain because they require human effort. Therefore, semi-supervised learning methods that exploit unlabeled examples in addition to labeled ones have attracted much attention.
Many current semi-supervised learning methods use a generative model for the classifier and employ ExpectationMaximization (EM) [Dempster et al., 1977] to model the label estimation or parameter estimation process. For example, mixture of Gaussians [Shahshahani and Landgrebe, 1994], mixture of experts [Miller and Uyar, 1997], and naive Bayes [Nigam et al., 2000] have been respectively used as the generative model, while EM is used to combine labeled and unlabeled data for classification. There are also many other methods such as using transductive inference for support vector machines to optimize performance on a specific test set [Joachims, 1999], constructing a graph on the examples such that the minimum cut on the graph yields an optimal labeling of the unlabeled examples according to certain optimization functions [Blum and Chawla, 2001], etc.

A prominent achievement in this area is the co-training paradigm proposed by Blum and Mitchell [1998], which trains two classifiers separately on two sufficient and redundant views, i.e. two attribute sets each of which is sufficient for learning and conditionally independent to the other given the class label, and uses the predictions of each classifier on unlabeled examples to augment the training set of the other.
Dasgupta et al. [2002] have shown that when the requirement of sufficient and redundant views is met, the co-trained classifiers could make few generalization errors by maximizing their agreement over the unlabeled data. Unfortunately, such a requirement can hardly be met in most scenarios. Goldman and Zhou [2000] proposed an algorithm which does not exploit attribute partition. This algorithm requires using two different supervised learning algorithms that partition the instance space into a set of equivalence classes, and employs cross validation technique to determine how to label the unlabeled examples and how to produce the final hypothesis. Although the requirement of sufficient and redundant views is quite strict, the co-training paradigm has already been used in many domains such as statistical parsing and noun phrase identification [Hwa et al., 2003][Pierce and Cardie, 2001][Sarkar, 2001][Steedman et al., 2003].
It is noteworthy that previous research mainly focuses on classification while regression remains almost untouched. In this paper, a co-training style semi-supervised regression algorithm named COREG, i.e. CO-training REGressors, is proposed. This algorithm employs two k-nearest neighbor (kNN) regressors, each of which labels the unlabeled data for the other during the learning process. In order to choose appropriate unlabeled examples to label, COREG estimates the labeling confidence through consulting the influence of the labeling of unlabeled examples on the labeled examples. The final prediction is made by averaging the regression estimates generated by both regressors. Since COREG utilizes different distance metrics instead of requiring sufficient and redundant views, its applicability is broad. Moreover, experimental results show that this algorithm can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes the COREG algorithm. Section 3 presents an analysis on the algorithm. Section 4 reports on the experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes and raises several issues for future work.

2 COREG
Let L = {(x1, y1), и и и , (x|L|, y|L|)} denote the labeled example set, where xi is the i-th instance described by d attributes, yi is its real-valued label, i.e. its expected realvalued output, and |L| is the number of labeled examples; let U denote the unlabeled data set, where the instances are also described by the d attributes, whose real-valued labels are unknown, and |U | is the number of unlabeled examples.
Two regressors, i.e. h1 and h2, are generated from L, each of which is then refined with the help of unlabeled exam-
ples that are labeled by the latest version of the other regressor. Here the kNN regressor [Dasarathy, 1991] is used as the base learner to instantiate h1 and h2, which labels a new instance through averaging the real-valued labels of its k-nearest neighboring examples.
The use of kNN regressor as the base learner is due to the
following considerations. First, the regressors will be refined
in each of many learning iterations. If neural networks or re-
gression trees are used, then in each iteration the regressors have to be re-trained with the labeled examples in addition to
the newly labeled ones, the computational load of which will be quite heavy. Since kNN is a lazy learning method which
does not hold a separate training phase, the refinement of the kNN regressors can be efficiently realized. Second, in order
to choose appropriate unlabeled examples to label, the label-
ing confidence should be estimated. In COREG the estimation
utilizes the neighboring properties of the training examples, which can be easily coupled with the kNN regressors.
It is noteworthy that the initial regressors should be diverse
because if they are identical, then for either regressor, the unlabeled examples labeled by the other regressor may be
the same as these labeled by the regressor for itself. Thus, the algorithm degenerates to self-training [Nigam and Ghani, 2000] with a single learner. In the standard setting of co-
training, the use of sufficient and redundant views enables the
learners be different. Previous research has also shown that
even when there is no natural attribute partitions, if there are
sufficient redundancy among the attributes then a fairly rea-
sonable attribute partition will enable co-training to exhibit advantages [Nigam and Ghani, 2000]. While in the extended
co-training algorithm which does not require sufficient and redundant views, the diversity among the learners is achieved through using different learning algorithms [Goldman and Zhou, 2000]. Since COREG does not assume sufficient and
redundant views and different learning algorithms, the diver-
sity of the regressors should be sought from other channels.
Here the diversity is achieved through utilizing different distance metrics. In fact, a key of kNN learner is how to
determine the distances between different instances. The
Minkowsky distance shown in Eq. 1 is usually used for this
purpose. Note that different concrete distance metrics can be
generated through setting different values to the distance order, p. Roughly speaking, the smaller the order, the more
robust the resulting distance metric to data variations; while
the bigger the order, the more sensitive the resulting distance
metric to data variations. Therefore, the vicinities identified
for a given instance may be different using the Minkowsky distance with different orders. Thus, the kNN regressors h1

and h2 can be diverse through instantiating them with different p values. Such a setting can also bring another profit, that is, since it is usually difficult to decide which p value is better
for the concerned task, the functions of these regressors may
be somewhat complementary to be combined.

In order to choose appropriate unlabeled examples to la-
bel, the labeling confidence should be estimated such that the
most confidently labeled example can be identified. In classi-
fication this is relatively straightforward because when mak-
ing classifications, many classifiers can also provide an esti-
mated probability (or an approximation) for the classification,
e.g. a Naive Bayes classifier returns the maximum posteriori
hypothesis where the posterior probabilities can be used, a
BP neural network classifier returns thresholded classification
where the real-valued outputs can be used, etc. Therefore, the
labeling confidence can be estimated through consulting the
probabilities of the unlabeled examples being labeled to dif-
ferent classes. For example, suppose the probability of the instance a being classified to the classes c1 and c2 is 0.90 and 0.10, respectively, while that of the instance b is 0.60 and 0.40, respectively. Then the instance a is more confident to be labeled (to class c1).
Unfortunately, in regression there is no such estimated
probability that can be used directly. This is because in con-
trast to classification where the number of class labels to be
predicted is finite, the possible predictions in regression are
infinite. Therefore, a key of COREG is the mechanism for
estimating the labeling confidence.
Heuristically, the most confidently labeled example of a
regressor should be with such a property, i.e. the error of
the regressor on the labeled example set should decrease the
most if the most confidently labeled example is utilized. In
other words, the most confidently labeled example should be
the one which makes the regressor most consistent with the
labeled example set. Thus, the mean squared error (MSE)
of the regressor on the labeled example set can be evaluated
first. Then, the MSE of the regressor utilizing the information provided by (xu, y^u) can be evaluated on the labeled example set, where xu is an unlabeled instance while y^u is the real-valued label generated by the original regressor. Let u denote the result of subtracting the latter MSE from the former MSE. Note that the number of u to be estimated equals to the number of unlabeled examples. Finally, (xu, y^u) associated with the biggest positive u can be regarded as the most confidently labeled example.
Since repeatedly measuring the MSE of the kNN regres-
sor on the whole labeled example set in each iteration will be time-consuming, considering that kNN regressor mainly uti-
lizes local information, COREG employs an approximation. That is, for each xu, COREG identifies its k-nearest neighboring labeled examples and uses them to compute the MSE. In detail, let  denote the set of k-nearest neighboring labeled examples of xu, then the most confidently labeled example is identified through maximizing the value of xu in Eq. 2, where h denotes the original regressor while h denotes the

The pseudo code of COREG is shown in Table 1, where the function kN N (Lj, k, pj) returns a kNN regressor on the labeled example set Lj, whose distance order is pi. The learn-
ing process stops when the maximum number of learning iterations, i.e. T , is reached, or there is no unlabeled exam-
ple which is capable of reducing the MSE of any of the re-
gressors on the labeled example set. According to Blum and Mitchell [1998]'s suggestion, a pool of unlabeled examples smaller than U is used. Note that in each iteration the unlabeled example chosen by h1 won't be chosen by h2, which
is an extra mechanism for encouraging the diversity of the regressors. Thus, even when h1 and h2 are similar, the exam-
ples they label for each other will still be different.

3 Analysis
This section attempts to analyze whether the learning process of COREG can use the unlabeled examples to improve the

regression estimates. In order to simplify the discussion, here the effect of the pool U is not considered as in [Blum and Mitchell, 1998]. That is, the unlabeled examples are assumed as being picked from the unlabeled example set U directly.
In each learning iteration of COREG, for each unlabeled example xu, its k-nearest neighboring labeled examples are put into the set . As mentioned before, the newly labeled exam-
ple should make the regressor become more consistent with
the labeled data set. Therefore, a criterion shown in Eq. 3 can be used to evaluate the goodness of xu, where h is the original regressor while h is the one refined with (xu, y^u). If the value of u is positive, then utilizing (xu, y^u) is beneficial.

In the COREG algorithm, the unlabeled example which maximizes the value of xu is picked to be labeled. There-
fore, the question is, whether the unlabeled example chosen

according to the maximization of xu will result in a positive u value or not.
First, assume that (xu, y^u) is among the k-nearest neighbors of some examples in , and is not among the k-nearest

neighbors of any other examples in L. In this case, it is obvi-

ous that utilizing (xu, y^u) will only change the regression estimates on the examples in , therefore Eq. 3 becomes Eq. 4.

Comparing Eqs. 2 with 4 it can be found that the maximiza-

tion of xu also results in the maximization of u.

Second, assume that (xu, y^u) is not among the k-nearest neighbors of any example in . In this case, the value of xu is zero, therefore (xu, y^u) won't be chosen in COREG.
Third, assume that (xu, y^u) is among the k-nearest neighbors of some examples in  as well as some examples in L - , and assume these examples in L -  are

(x1, y1), и и и , (xm, ym). Then Eq. 3 becomes Eq. 5.

(5)

Maximizing xu will maximize the first sum term of Eq. 5, but whether it can enable u be positive should also refer the second sum term. Unfortunately, the value of this sum term

is difficult to be measured except that the neighboring relationships between all the labeled examples and (xu, y^u) are
evaluated. Therefore, there may exist cases where the unlabeled example chosen according to the maximization of xu may decrease u, which is the cost COREG takes for using xu that can be more efficiently computed to approximate u. Nevertheless, experiments show that in most cases such
an approximation is effective.

It seems that using only one regressor to label the unlabeled

examples for itself might be feasible, where the unlabeled examples can be chosen according to the maximization of xu .

While considering that the labeled example set usually con-
tains noise, the use of two regressors can be helpful to reduce
overfitting. Let  denote the subset of noisy examples in L. For the
unlabeled instance xu, either of the regressors h1 and h2 will identify a set of k-nearest neighboring labeled examples for xu. Assume these sets are 1 and 2, respectively. Since h1 and h2 use different distance orders, 1 and 2 are usually different, and therefore 1   and 2   are also usually different. Suppose xu is labeled by h1 and then (xu, h1(xu)) is put into L1, where h1(xu) suffers from 1  . For another unlabeled instance xv which is very close to xu, its k-nearest neighbors identified by h1 will be very similar to 1 except that (xu, h1(xu)) has replaced a previous neighbor. Thus, h1(xv) will suffer from 1   more seriously than h1(xu) does. While, if the instance xu is labeled by h2 and (xu, h2(xu)) is put into L1, then h1(xv) will suffer from 1   only once, although xu is still very close to xv.

4 Experiments
Experiments are performed on ten data sets listed in Table 2 where "# attribute" denotes the number of input attributes. These data sets have been used in [Zhou et al., 2002] where the detailed descriptions of the data sets can be found. Note that the input attributes as well as the real-valued labels have been normalized to [0.0, 1.0].

For each data set, 25% data are kept as the test set, while
the remaining 75% data are partitioned into the labeled and
unlabeled sets where 10% (of the 75%) data are used as la-
beled examples while the remaining 90% (of the 75%) data
are used as unlabeled examples.
In the experiments, the distance orders used by the two kNN regressors in COREG are set to 2 and 5, respectively, the k value is set to 3, the maximum number of iterations T is set to 100, and the pool U contains 100 unlabeled examples
randomly picked from the unlabeled set in each iteration.
A self-training style algorithm is tested for comparison, which is denoted by SELF. This algorithm uses a kNN re-
gressor and in each iteration, it chooses the unlabeled example which maximizes the value of xu in Eq. 2 to label for itself. Moreover, a co-training style algorithm, denoted by
ARTRE, is also tested. Since the experimental data sets are
with no sufficient and redundant views, here an artificial re-
dundant view is developed through deriving new attributes

from the original ones. For example, on 3-d Mexican Hat two new attributes, i.e. x3 and x4, are constructed from x1 + x2 and x1 - x2, and then a kNN regressor is built on x1 and x2 while the other is built on x3 and x4. In each iteration, each kNN regressor chooses the unlabeled example which maximizes the value of xu in Eq. 2 to label for the other regressor. The final prediction is made by averaging the regression estimates of these two refined regressors. Besides, a kNN re-
gressor using only the labeled data is tested as a baseline for
the comparison, which is denoted by LABELED. All the kNN regressors used in SELF, ARTRE, and LA-
BELED employ 2nd-order Minkowski distance, and the k value is set to 3. The same pool, U , as that used by COREG is
used in each iteration of SELF and ARTRE, and the maximum
number of iterations is also set to 100.
One hundred runs of experiments are carried out on each
data set. In each run, the performance of all the four algo-
rithms, i.e. COREG, SELF, ARTRE, and LABELED, are eval-
uated on randomly partitioned labeled/unlabeled/test splits.
The average MSE at each iteration is recorded. Note that
the learning processes of the algorithms may stop before the
maximum number of iterations is reached, and in that case,
the final MSE is used in computing the average MSE of the
following iterations.
The improvement on average MSE obtained by exploiting
unlabeled examples is tabulated in Table 3, which is com-
puted by subtracting the final MSE from the initial MSE and
then divided by the initial MSE.

Table 3 shows that SELF and ARTRE improve the regression estimates on only five data sets, while COREG improves on eight data sets. Moreover, Table 3 discloses that the improvement of COREG is always bigger than that of SELF and ARTRE. These observations tell that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled examples to improve regression estimates.
For further studying the compared algorithms, the average MSE of different algorithms at different iterations are plotted in Fig 1, where the average MSE of the two kNN regressors used in COREG are also depicted. Note that in each subfigure, every curve contains 101 points corresponding to the 100 learning iterations in addition to the initial condition, where only 11 of them are explicitly depicted for better presentation.
Fig. 1 shows that COREG can exploit unlabeled examples to improve the regression estimates on most data sets, except that on Friedman #3 there is no improvement while on Plane

the performance is degenerated. While, SELF and ARTRE degenerate the regression estimates on five data sets, i.e. Friedman #1 to #3, Multi, and Plane. Moreover, the average MSE of the final prediction made by COREG is almost always the best except on Friedman #1 where ARTRE is slightly better and on Plane where LABELED is the best while all the semisupervised learning algorithms degenerate the performance. These observations disclose that COREG is apparently the best algorithm in the comparison.
Pairwise two-tailed t-tests with 0.05 significance level reveal that the final regression estimates of COREG are significantly better than its initial regression estimates on almost all the data sets except that on Plane the latter is better while on Friedman #3 there is no significant difference. Moreover,

the final regression estimates of COREG are significantly better than these of ARTRE on almost all the data sets except on Friedman #1 where the latter is better. Furthermore, the final regression estimates of COREG are significantly better than these of SELF and LABELED on almost all the data sets except on Plane where LABELED is better and on Friedman #3 where there is no significant difference. These results of t-tests confirm that COREG is the strongest among the compared algorithms, which can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve the regression estimates.
5 Conclusion
This paper proposes a co-training style semi-supervised regression algorithm COREG. This algorithm employs two k-

nearest neighbor regressors using different distance metrics. In each learning iteration, each regressor labels the unlabeled example which can be most confidently labeled for the other learner, where the labeling confidence is estimated through considering the consistency of the regressor with the labeled example set. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of both the refined kNN regressors. Experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve the regression estimates.
In contrast to standard co-training setting, COREG does not require sufficient and redundant views, which enables it have broad applicability. However, this forces COREG generate diverse initial regressors with specific mechanisms. In this paper the diversity is obtained by instantiating the Minkowski distance with different distance orders. It is obvious that using completely different distance metrics may be more helpful. Moreover, trying to obtain the diversity of the initial regressors from channels other than using different distance metrics is an issue to be investigated in future work. Note that although this paper uses kNN regressor as the base learner, an important idea of COREG, i.e. regarding the labeling of the unlabeled example which makes the regressor most consistent with the labeled example set as with the most confidence, can also be used with other base learners. Therefore, designing semi-supervised regression algorithms with other base learners along the way of COREG is another interesting issue to be explored in the future. Furthermore, designing semi-supervised regression algorithms outside the co-training framework is also well-worth studying.
