TN many signal processing applications, the long-term dynamic range of the signal is too large to be accommo-
dated using practical A/D converters. The use of automatic gain control (AGC) prior to A/D conversion is commonly used in this situation to reduce the long-term dynamic range. Short-term signal variations must still, of course, be within the range of the A/D converter.

using this component in an AGC loop is shown in Fig. 1. Here a digitally controlled attenuator is formed by using the MDAC in the feedback loop of an op-amp. The attenuation sequence that controls the MDAC is computed from the input samples using some algorithm.

Fig. 1. Block diagram of signal processing system with digital AGC.

II. ANALYSIS Fig. 2 shows an envelope equivalent block diagram of a discrete-time AGC amplifier where x(n) is the input and y(n) the output. For convenience, the inputs and outputs are assumed to have been scaled to a reference of unity with no other gain factors appearing in the loop. An error sequence e(n) is derived by subtracting the reference from the output and is filtered by an accumulator. The accumulator output b (n - 1) controls a nonlinear attenuator which is represented by the function f(b) and a divider. An alternative configuration of Fig. 2 could, of course, be arranged by replacing the divider with a multiplier and replacing f with l/f. The function f is assumed to be a continuous, strictly monotonically increasing function.' The system of equations describing the model is given by

y(n) = x(n)/a(n - 1)

(la)

a (n) = f[b (n) ]

(ib)

b(n) = b(n - 1) + e(n)

(lc)

and

e(n) = y(n)-1

(1d)

The time index n for these variables implies discrete samples taken every T seconds.
It can be shown by linearization that for a nominal trajectory x== = x and yn 1, the normalized smallsignal transfer function of Fig. 2 is given by [1]

where

H(z) = Z - aE *-

(3)

and

K = f'f[E ()]/x > 0.

(4)

The "loop gain" K and hence the transfer function are seen to vary according to the average input level x. A

'Alternatively, a monotonically decreasing function can be used if the polarity of the error signal is reversed, i.e., e(t) = 1 - y(t).

small-signal time constant is defined as

T = -T/lna, for <O a < 1.

(5)

As can be seen from the transfer function, the AGC amplifier is stable in a small-signal sense provided that a < 1, i.e., the incremental loop gain satisfies the condition O < K < 2.
As in the continuous case, it is noted that for exponential feedback f(b) = exp (yb), the loop gain K = y is constant and hence the small-signal response is independent of input level [1]-[3]. This is a desirable characteristic for many applications. Besides maintaining a levelindependent frequency response, exponential feedback also affords an extra measure of protection against conditional instability since the loop gain is constant.
For exponential feedback, (lb) and (lc) can be combined as

a(n) = a(n - 1) exp [Eye(n) ].

(6)

This suggests the alternative configuration shown in Fig. 3
which is equivalent to Fig. 2 for g(e) = f(e) = exp (,ye).
Since a constant error would give rise to a geometric attenuation sequence, this configuration is deemed "geometric feedback." The function g is required to be strictly positive, monotonically increasing, and in addition g(O) = 1.
For steady-state conditions, it is easy to see that the incremental loop gain is given by

K = g'[g-(1)]

(7)

and the small-signal relationships (2), (3), and (5) all hold with (4) replaced by (7). It is significant that (7) is independent of signal level, a desirable property as pre-
viously mentioned. If g(e) = f(e) = exp (eye), then (4)
and (7) are of course equivalent. The significance of the geometric feedback configura-
tion is that the function g can be tailored to give the desired large-signal transient response while the smallsignal response remains independent of input level.
An alternative configuration of Fig. 3 could be arranged by replacing the divider with a multiplier and replacing g with i/g. This configuration may be more desirable for implementation in some cases.

where yo = y(0) specifies the initial output level and is equal to the ratio of the input step transition. Equation (12) is plotted in Fig. 4 for various input levels. As can be seen convergence is faster for yo < 1 but slower for yo > 1 as would be expected since exp (ye) > 1 + ye.

In practice, it is necessary to limit 1 + ye so that g >
gqin > 0, for all e. A plot of normalized error is shown in
Fig. 5 and demonstrates the asymptotic exponential behavior predicted from the small-signal theory.
For other choices-of g, the response will generally involve a nonlinear difference equation. Methods for analyzing this situation using the discrete Volterra series are described in [1].
III. CONCLUSIONS A new digital AGC algorithm has been developed which is called "geometric feedback." This algorithm has the desirable property that the small-signal response is independent of input level. This property holds independent of the particular nonlinearity used. Therefore, the nonlinearity can be tailored to give the desired large-signal

transient response while preserving level invariant smallsignal response.
In the simplest form, a linear feedback function results in a linear difference equation which can be solved in terms of an arbitrary input. Level-invariant small-signal response was demonstrated by illustrating the asymptotic convergence of the error to an exponential decay.
Other types of nonlinearities in the geometric feedback algorithm are a subject for future investigations.

System Fault Diagnosis: Closure and Diagnosability with Repair
JEFFREY D. RUSSELL, MEMBER, IEEE, AND CHARLES R. KIME, MEMBER, IEEE

Abstract-Determination of the detectability and diagnosability of a digital system containing at most t faulty system components is considered. The model employed is to an extent independent of the means used to implement diagnostic procedures, i.e., whether the tests are accomplished via hardware, software, or combinations thereof. A parameter, called the closure index, is defined which characterizes the capability for executing valid tests in the presence of faults. The closure index can be thought of as the size of the smallest potentially undetectable multiple-fault in the system as modeled. On the basis of this parameter, results are presented which permit the determination of t-fault detectability and t-fault diagnosabiity with repair for the system. Examples are presented to illustrate the application of the model for systems close to those encountered in actual practice.

INTRODUCTION SEVERAL studies [1]-[9] have been concerned with
system-level fault diagnosis and have had as an objective the determination of conditions for diagnosability. Interest in this topic is motivated by the need for highly available digital systems that can continue operation, perhaps at reduced capacity, when multiple hardware failures occur. The approach to such systems via reconfiguration or standby sparing requires that the presence of malfunctioning elements be detected and their location determined to within a system module, i.e., the system must be diagnosable. Moreover, initial diagnosis to the level of large replaceable modules can reduce system downtime in those cases in which manual repair is performed.
Most of the previous models for system-level diagnostic analysis have considered the system to be partitioned into a number of disjoint subsystems under the assumption that each subsystem can be completely tested by some combination of the other subsystems. Each test so defined involves the controlled application of stimuli to the subsystem under test and the analysis of the ensuing responses, resulting in the evaluation of the tested sub-
