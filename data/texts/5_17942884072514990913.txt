An Anatomical Database Providing Three-Dimensional Geometric Representation of Lower Limb Structures
Alan Barr and David Hawkins
An anatomical database was constructed containing three-dimensional geometric representations of the structures comprising the lower extremity. The database was constructed by digitizing 100 high-resolution digital photographic images supplied from the National Library of Medicine's Visual Human Male (VHM) project. These images were taken of sequential transverse cross-sectional slices of the leg. Slices were located 1 cm apart between a location approximately 3 mm below the superior aspect of the ilium and approximately 2 mm below the distal end of the fibula. Image Tool Software (v. 2.0) was used to manually digitize the perimeters of muscles, tendons, and bones of the pelvis, thigh, and shank from the right leg of the VHM. Additionally, the perimeter of the leg and the inner aspect of the superficial fat layer were digitized. The pelvis was digitized as a hemi-pelvis. Tissue perimeters were characterized using between 10 and 151 nodes within each slice; the number of nodes varied depending on the tissue's size. Transverse cross-sectional slice number, structure identification, node number, and the two-dimensional coordinates of each node were stored in a data file. The information contained in this file is unique and provides a database that researchers can use to investigate questions related to tissue anatomy and movement mechanics that cannot be considered using existing musculoskeletal data sets.

Introduction
Musculoskeletal modeling is an important aspect of human movement studies. Musculoskeletal models vary in sophistication depending on the objectives of the study. Models of limb segments and the joints connecting these segments are required in order to quantify intersegmental forces and moments. More sophisticated models that include the line-ofaction of individual tissues and their material properties are required in order to investigate individual tissue forces or create muscle-based forward simulations of human movement.
Several investigations have been conducted to determine tissue specific data for use in musculoskeletal modeling. Muscle architecture and muscle line-of-action have been estimated from cadaver, Computerized Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance

Imaging (MRI) data. Yamaguchi et al. (1990) provide a comprehensive summary of these approaches. Studies of muscle architecture generally provide estimates of muscle volume, fiber pennation angle, muscle length, fiber length, and muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA; Alexander & Vernon, 1975; Wickiewicz et al., 1983). These data are needed to estimate the force generating characteristics of the muscle. Studies of muscle line-ofaction typically identify the location of muscle-bone attachment sites relative to coordinate systems fixed within segments and assume a straight line-of-action from origin to insertion (Dostal & Andrews, 1981; Brand et al., 1982; Kepple et al., 1998). These data are needed to determine the moment arm of a muscle about a joint.
The data sets described above are valuable for quantifying the forces induced in individual tissues during movement and for facilitating forward simulations of human movement dynamics, but they provide limited information for the biomechanist interested in detailed analyses of the interaction between limb anatomy and limb dynamics. The data sets mentioned above provide only a few data points to represent the path of each muscletendon unit and only a few parameters (e.g., PCSA, volume, and muscle length) to describe each muscle's geometry. They do not provide information pertaining to the geometry of individual muscles throughout the limb or the spatial interaction between muscles. Such information is fundamental for understanding how individual tissues contribute to limb inertial properties, intersegmental loads, and the spatial limitations affecting muscle action and growth.
The purpose of this study was to create an anatomical database containing threedimensional geometric representations of the structures comprising the lower extremity. This data set, when combined with appropriate mathematical models and computational techniques, provides the user the opportunity to manipulate tissue morphology throughout the leg, and to investigate questions related to tissue anatomy and movement mechanics that cannot be considered using existing musculoskeletal data sets.
Methods
The anatomical database was constructed from high-resolution photographic images taken from the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Visual Human Project (VHP) <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html>, and specifically the Visual Human Male (VHM). The VHM was constructed from the cadaver of a 39-year-old male having a height and weight of 1.8 m (5'11") and 885 N (199 lbs.), respectively. The photographic images used in this study were taken from transverse sections of the right lower extremity located between approximately 3 mm below the superior aspect of the ilium and 2 mm below the distal end of the fibula. Sequential images were separated by 1 cm. One hundred images of the VHM were downloaded from Dr. John McNulty's "Visible Human Cross Sections" website <http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/vhp/ Visible.htm>. The images were in JPG format, with the following image characteristics: resolution from 1,760 pixels  1,024 pixels to 1,344 pixels  832 pixels, red/green/blue color planes with 8 bits per plane, and a maximum of 16 million colors. The variation in resolution resulted from differences in image cropping. One of the NLM's VHM images (Image #2090) is shown in Figure 1. This image was taken from the mid-thigh. The right leg is shown on the left side of the image. The cross-section is viewed from a distal to proximal perspective, with the anterior aspect of the body being toward the top of the image. There are two slices missing from the lower extremity VHM data set. Slice #2020 and #2430 are missing due to "saw kerf," the thickness of the blade used to cut the subject into three major sections as needed for handling and slicing.

The right thigh is shown on the left side of the image. The image is shown as viewed from a distal to proximal perspective, the person's feet would be out of the page and the anterior surface of the body is toward the top of the image.

The perimeter of every muscle, tendon, and bone appearing in the cross-sectional images of the pelvis, thigh, and shank were manually digitized using Image Tool Software (v. 2.0), developed by Don Wilcox et al. at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (UTHSCS; available from the internet by anonymous ftp from maxrad6.uthscsa.edu). Additionally, the perimeter of the leg and the inner aspect of the superficial fat layer were digitized. The pelvis was digitized as a hemi-pelvis. A calibration ruler, present in each image, was used to convert the units of measurement within each image from pixels to centimeters (conversion factor: 31 pixels = 1 cm). Figure 2 illustrates the digitized representation of the right leg shown in Figure 1. The x and y coordinates of each digitized node were saved to a file. An identifier was used to associate all nodes representing a specific structure. Each structure was digitized in a clockwise manner, with an average spacing between nodes of approximately 5 mm. Node spacing for bone was considerably less (2­3 mm). The number of nodes used to represent a given structure varied depending on the size and curvature of the structure. Image analysis was performed on a Dell Dimension XPS D333 computer, with a 53.34 cm (21") monitor set at 1,600 pixel  1,200 pixel resolution and high color. The combination of high-resolution images and a high-resolution monitor was necessary to clearly identify structures and to accurately digitize their perimeters.
Several efforts were made to ensure that the digitizing process provided an accurate representation of each tissue. The NLM's Atlas of the Visible Human Male: Reverse Engineering of the Human Body by Spitzer and Whitlock (1998), was used as an aid to identify anatomical structures within each slice of the leg. The book contains small pictures of every transverse slice of the VHM data set along with labeled full-page color images of approximately every 10th slice. Twelve tissues within slice #2110, which corresponds to a midsection of the thigh, were digitized on three separate occasions over a 4-day period to test the repeatability of the digitizing process. Some muscles within this slice have boundaries that were somewhat unclear and thus provided the worst-case test for repeatability. Tissue area was calculated using algorithms developed by Nagurka and Hayes (1980). An area coefficient of variation (CV) was determined from the three repeat trials for each tissue [CV = 100 · SD / mean].
Node spacing was selected to represent the tissue's perimeter while using a minimum number of nodes. The appropriateness of the node spacing was tested by comparing the area calculated for the vastus medialis muscle, using the number of nodes used in creating the data set, with the area calculated for the same tissue represented using approximately seven times as many nodes. The vastus medialis was selected for this test because, as shown in Figure 2, it has a unique shape and curvature. The vastus medialis perimeter was digitized three times using the normal node spacing and three times using the reduced node spacing. The difference in average tissue area between the two-node spacing methods was calculated.
Muscle volumes were determined for the quadriceps muscles by summing crosssectional areas across all slices in which a muscle appeared and then multiplying this area by the slice thickness (1 cm). These volumes were compared to previously reported cadaver data. A computer program written using Visual Basic (v. 5.0) for Windows was used to view the anatomical data set and to identify any gross digitizing errors.
Results
The resulting data file was organized as follows: column one contains the slice number, column two contains a structure identifier number, column three contains the node number,

column four contains the x coordinate of the node, and column five contains the y coordinate of the node (see Table 1). The file contains x-y coordinate data sorted by slice (beginning at the ilium and ending distal to the fibula), structure, and node, respectively. The data set describes 41 muscles, 21 tendons, 6 bones, the patellar ligament, an infrapatellar fat pad, the outer leg perimeter, and the inner perimeter of the superficial fat layer. If a single structure appeared in a slice as two separate bodies, then it was assigned two separate identification numbers. The proximal end of the femur presented a portion of the femoral head and the greater trochanter separately in a single slice. The femoral condyles appeared as two distinct structures in a single slice at the distal end of the femur. The intercondylar eminence and the lateral condyle appeared separately in a single slice within the proximal end of the tibia. The distal end of the flexor hallucis longus muscle appeared split by its tendon. The adductor hiatus located in the adductor magnus muscle caused this muscle to appear as two structures within a single slice. The gluteus medius muscle appeared split at the level of the femoral head. Several slices through the pelvis contained separate sections of the pelvic bones. The final data set contains 86 indexed structures and 59,193 rows of data. The entire data set is freely available from Human Kinetics <http://www.hkusa.com/resources/legdata.zip>.
The digitizing process used to represent each structure was repeatable and accurately characterized the tissue geometry. The coefficient of variation in the area calculated for the 12 muscles digitized on three separate occasions was between 0.1% and 1.2% (see Table 2). The difference in tissue area for the vastus medialis calculated using the normal node spacing and the reduced node spacing was less than 0.3%. This suggests that the selected node spacing was appropriate for accurately representing the tissue geometry.

The VHM had muscle volumes 14 to 50% larger.
An illustration of a portion of the lower limb anatomical data set, created by the software used to visualize and check the gross features of the data, is shown in Figure 3. The data set provides clear geometric representations of the lower extremity structures.
Discussion
An anatomical database was constructed containing three-dimensional geometric representations of the structures comprising the lower extremity. This database is unique compared to other databases developed previously for musculoskeletal modeling and simulation

applications. Previous databases typically contain three-dimensional coordinates of only a few points, selected to represent the attachment locations and contact points between muscle-tendon units and bones (Brand et al., 1982; Dostal & Andrews, 1981; Kepple et al., 1998). These databases have proven useful for standard dynamic analyses of human movement, but they do not provide the user the opportunity to examine the detailed geometry of muscles throughout the leg and the spatial relationships between muscles. They do not allow users to make their own interpretation of muscle attachment locations, and they do not provide the user with data that can be used to simulate a variety of tissue morphologies throughout the leg. These capabilities are needed to study many questions related to the spatial orientation of structures and the borders between structures, how these borders may change in response to muscle disease, trauma, disuse, and overuse, and how tissue morphology affects limb inertial properties and limb dynamics. The current database provides the user with much greater anatomical information than is currently available.
Great care was taken to ensure that the data accurately reflect tissue boundaries within the VHM leg. Commercial software packages such as ANALYZETM (Mayo Medical Ventures, Rochester, MN) could have been used to automatically identify tissue boundaries. However, these packages identify tissue boundaries based on image contrast, which was not a reliable indicator for many tissues within the VHM leg. For this reason, the database was constructed using labor intensive hand digitizing combined with extensive referencing of anatomical texts and cadaver specimens. Despite these efforts, there were still some muscle boundaries that were unclear and open for interpretation by the person digitizing. These included the border between vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius, and the border between extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL).

The major limitations of the database are the single subject sample size and the spacing between transverse slices. Though the data accurately represent the geometry of the structures within the VHM lower limb, they do not indicate how this geometry varies across the population. Muscle volume data presented in Table 3 indicate that there is considerable variation in muscle structure even between people of similar age and size. Fortunately, many general concepts can be tested using data from a single subject. Further, these data provide the user the opportunity to create customized limb anatomy that can be used in musculoskeletal modeling and movement simulation. Specific limb anatomical features can be created by manipulating tissue node locations.
The 1-cm spacing between slices limits the data set in regions where there are abrupt transitions occurring between tissues. This is clearly seen in the region of the knee, where it is evident that the tissues are only grossly represented, and thus the data would not be suitable for constructing an anatomically detailed knee model. The 1-cm spacing also makes it difficult to clearly identify the exact location of some muscle-tendon attachment sites.
Despite these limitations the database provides a unique resource to facilitate new areas of biomedical and biomechanical research not previously attainable.
