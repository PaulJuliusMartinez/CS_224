z "Fuzzy theory is wrong, wrong, and pernicious. I can not think of any problem that could not be solved better by ordinary logic."(Professor William Kahan, 1975)
z "Pattern recognition analysis and fuzzy logic analysis of breath VOCs independently distinguished healthy controls from hospitalized patients with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity." (Dr. Michael Phillips, 2007)
z "Because of this sophisticated functionality and performance realized by fuzzy logic, the number of sale of our Omron's blood pressure meter in all over the world is over 8,000,000 per year now." (Hiroshi Nakajima, 2007)

z Rationale A: fuzzy logic is designed to deal with ipsystems.
z Rationale B: if a p-system is associated with a tolerance for imprecision, then the tolerance for imprecision may be exploited through deliberate imprecisiation which reduces cost. Imprecisiation is followed by precisiation of meaning (fuzzy logic gambit).

THE CONCEPT OF A FUZZY SET
z In the real world, most classes have unsharp boundaries and transition from membership to nonmembership is gradual rather than abrupt. Informally, a fuzzy set is a class with unsharp boundaries. A fuzzy set is associated with a membership function which assigns to each object its grade of membership in the fuzzy set.

FUZZY SETS AND NATURAL LANGUAGES
z Basically, a natural language is a system for describing perceptions. Perceptions are intrinsically imprecise (fuzzy), reflecting the bounded ability of human sensory organs, and ultimately the brain, to resolve detail and store information. Imprecision of perceptions is passed on to natural languages.

z The concept of a fuzzy set is a simple, almost obvious concept. There is a compelling need for this concept for construction of better models of reality. It is this need that motivated my 1965 paper on fuzzy sets.
z When I wrote my first paper on fuzzy sets my expectation was that the concept of a fuzzy set would gain rapid acceptance. This is not what happened. What I encountered was skepticism, derision and hostility.

"I would like to comment briefly on Professor

Zadeh's presentation. His proposals could be

severely, ferociously, even brutally criticized

from a technical point of view. This would be

out of place here. But a blunt question remains:

Is Professor Zadeh presenting important ideas

or is he indulging in wishful thinking? No doubt

Professor Zadeh's enthusiasm for fuzziness has

been reinforced by the prevailing climate in the

U.S.--one of unprecedented permissiveness.

`Fuzzification' is a kind of scientific

permissiveness; it tends to result in socially

appealing slogans unaccompanied by the

discipline of hard scientific work and patient

In a similar vein, my esteemed colleague Professor William Kahan--a man with a brilliant mind--offered this assessment in 1975.

Dear Prof. Zadeh:

My name is Hidemitsu Ogawa, I am the official engineer of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japanese Government. I am making research in pattern recognition at the Electrotechnical Laboratory.

I read with very interest your paper on "Fuzzy Sets" in Information and Control. I will tell you my impression. I think that the concept of a fuzzy set is very important for problems of pattern recognition and information processing. In these fields, the notion of a fuzzy set provides us with good visibility."

FUZZY LOGIC--KEY POINTS
z "Fuzzy logic" is not fuzzy logic z Fuzzy logic is a precise logic of
approximate reasoning and approximate computation

The principal distinguishing features of fuzzy logic are:

a) In fuzzy logic everything is, or is allowed to be graduated, that is, be a matter of degree

b) In fuzzy logic everything is allowed to be granulated

34 /79

LAZ 4/28/2008

FUZZY LOGIC--KEY POINTS
z More specifically, fuzzy logic is a precise system of concepts and techniques aimed at formalization/mechanization of two remarkable human capabilities (a) to converse, reason and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information and partiality of truth; and (b) the capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks (e.g., driving a car in city traffic, without any measurements and any computations).

z In bivalent logic, BL, truth is bivalent, implying that every proposition, p, is either true or false, with no degrees of truth allowed
z In multivalent logic, ML, truth is a matter of degree
z In fuzzy logic, FL: z everything is, or is allowed to be, to be graduated, i.e., a matter of degree z everything is, or is allowed to be, granulated (linguistic)

37 /79

LAZ 4/28/2008

CONTINUED z Fuzzy logic is much more general than
traditional logical systems. The greater generality of fuzzy logic is needed to deal with complex problems in the realms of search, question-answering decision and control. Fuzzy logic provides a foundation for the development of new tools for dealing with natural languages and knowledge representation.

ACCEPTANCE OF FUZZY LOGIC

z In the evolution of science a time comes when alongside the brilliant successes of a theory, T, what becomes visible are classes of problems which fall beyond the reach of T. At that point, the stage is set for a progression from T to T*--a generalization of T
Among the many historical examples are the transitions from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics; from linear system theory to nonlinear system theory; and from deterministic models to probabilistic models in economics and decision analysis

Fuzzy logic is a better approximation to reality
LAZ 4/28/2008

CONTINUED
z In this perspective, a fundamental point-- a point which is not as yet widely recognized-- is that there are many classes of problems which cannot be addressed by any theory, T, which is based on bivalent logic. The problem with bivalent logic is that it is in fundamental conflict with reality­ a reality in which almost everything is a matter of degree. To deal with reality what is needed is fuzzy logic.

z what we are beginning to appreciate--and what Lord Kelvin did not--is the fundamental importance of the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations.

COMPUTATION WITH INFORMATION DESCRIBED IN NATURAL LANGUAGE

z Representing the meaning of a proposition as a generalized constraint reduces the problem of computation with information described in natural language to the problem of computation with generalized constraints. In large measure, computation with generalized constraints involves the use of rules which govern propagation and counterpropagation of generalized constraints. Among such rules, the principal rule is the deduction principle (Zadeh 1965, 1975).

68 /79

LAZ 4/28/2008

EXTENSION PRINCIPLE (POSSIBILISTIC)
z X is a variable which takes values in U, and f is a function from U to V. The point of departure is a possibilistic constraint on f(X) expressed as f(X) is A where A is a fuzzy relation in V which is defined by its membership function A(v), vV.
z g is a function from U to W. The possibilistic constraint on f(X) induces a possibilistic constraint on g(X) which may be expressed as g(X) is B where B is a fuzzy relation. The question is: What is B?

CONCLUSION
z Existing scientific theories are based on bivalent logic--a logic in which everything is black or white, with no shades of gray allowed
z What is not recognized, to the extent that it should, is that bivalent logic is in fundamental conflict with reality
z Fuzzy logic is not in conflict with bivalent logic--it is a generalization of bivalent logic in which everything is, or is allowed to be, a matter of degree
z Fuzzy logic provides a foundation for the methodology of computing with words and perceptions
