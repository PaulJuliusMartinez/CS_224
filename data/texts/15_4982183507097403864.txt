Abstract Introduction: Natural scaffolds have been shown to induce T helper 2 (TH2)-specific immune responses in host tissues; however, the precise mechanisms that underlie this immune response are unknown. Using a porcine animal model, we evaluated the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and matrix remodelling in the implantation of bladder acellular matrix (ACM) grafts and ACMs fortified with biomimetic materials. Materials and Methods: Bladders were decellularized with detergent and treated in 3 different ways prior to implantation: ACM alone, hyaluronic acid (HA)-ACM and HA-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-ACM. Animals were sacrificed at 4 or 10 weeks post-implantation and total gene expressions for TH2 (IL-4), TH1 (IFN-), TLR2, TLR4, and TGF-1 were analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. Using histology (H&E and Masson's trichrome) and immunohistochemistry (uroplakin, -smooth muscle actin, CD31 and factor VIII) the regenerative capacity was correlated with the gene expression of different proteins. Results: IL-4, TLR2, and TLR4 gene expression were markedly decreased at 4 and 10 weeks in both the HA-ACM group and the HA-VEGF-ACM group compared to ACM alone. IFN- expression was negligible in all groups and time periods. TGF-1 expression was highest in the HA-

and VEGF-treated grafts. Recellularization was inversely pro-

portional to TLR and TH2 expression but proportional to

TGF-1. Conclusion: ACM alone grafts demonstrated stron-

ger TLR4 expression which may promote a distinct TH2 im-

mune response and a reduced regenerative capacity in

grafts. Treatment of grafts with HA and VEGF may help regu-

late host immune responses by reducing TLR4 and IL-4 and

increasing TGF-1.

Introduction
The urinary bladder is a highly compliant organ that functions as a reservoir for the storage and emptying of urine. While the dynamic function of the bladder is primarily attributed to its smooth muscle cell component and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), its impermeability is dependent on the urothelium and glycosaminoglycans. Many diseases affecting the bladder such as congenital anomalies and chronic inflammation may lead to a disruption of bladder wall function, limiting its overall performance and invariably requiring surgical bladder augmentation or replacement [Khoury et al., 1992].
The traditional incorporation of bowel segments in urinary bladder substitution has been associated with serious complications, including various systemic changes such as cancer, making this approach less than ideal [McDougal, 1992; Lawrenson et al., 2001]. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine represent an alternative therapeutic approach for the regeneration of damaged or diseased organs [Atala, 2004]. Bladder tissue engineering involves the use of implantable, compliant, and biodegradable scaffolds with inherent mechanical properties to augment the urinary bladder. We have identified a biocompatible bladder acellular matrix (ACM) that retains a native bladder ECM collagenous composition and intrinsic mechanical properties [Brown et al., 2002]. We further enhanced its impermeability with the incorporation of hyaluronic acid (HA), a major glycosaminoglycan component, which plays a key role in cell growth and migration [Cartwright et al., 2006a]. Reconstitution of the ACM with HA was not only effective in providing a functional barrier against urine seepage, but also enhanced the matrix's ability to retain growth factors and improved its in vivo characteristics [Farhat et al., 2003]. Additional incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) demonstrated an enhanced vascularization of the implanted grafts, and overall improved bladder tissue regeneration and development [Cartwright et al., 2006a].
Although ECM-like grafts are thought to serve as natural bioscaffolds for organ-specific tissue engineering, there is limited knowledge on the role of the immune system upon implantation of grafts. Naturally implanted scaffolds are thought to elicit an upregulation of host CD4+ T helper 2 (TH2) immune response [Allman et al., 2002], a characteristic of graft acceptance. However, this study also demonstrated that a T cell-dependent TH2specific immune response was not required for graft ac-

ceptance or remodelling [Allman et al., 2002], suggesting that other immune cells, including macrophages (M), are present in response to biological scaffolds. Macrophage polarization (analogous to TH cell polarization) is fundamental in the immune and healing process. M2 macrophage polarization has been associated with degradation and healing during ACM implantation [Badylak et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2009; Valentin et al., 2009]. In this study, we sought to examine factors that may contribute to polarization of the host immune response toward a specific cascade during the implantation of ACMs.
The innate immune system plays a significant role in driving the adaptive immune response toward a specific TH cascade [Goldstein and Tesar, 2004; Krutzik et al., 2005; Netea et al., 2005] triggering alloantibody secretions, the inhibition of macrophage function, and the promotion of fibrosis and tissue remodelling [Libby and Pober, 2001; Allman et al., 2002]. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) belong to a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize various ECM molecules including biglycans [Schaefer et al., 2004], fibronectin [Kulka and Metcalfe, 2006], and urine-derived glycoproteins [Saemann et al., 2005]. TLRs have shown a potential to influence TH polarization in the adaptive immune response [Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000; Ohashi et al., 2000; Li et al., 2001; Termeer et al., 2002; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004; Saemann et al., 2005]. An upregulation of TLR activity has been observed with the implantation of various tissues [Goldstein et al., 2003; Goldstein and Tesar, 2004; Methe et al., 2004]. However, the precise role of TLR activity, specifically in the context of natural acellular scaffolds, in directing and triggering the adaptive immune response has not yet been investigated.
We hypothesize that ACM implantations may stimulate TLR expression and promote TH2-specific immune responses and that the incorporation of biomimetic molecules, HA and HA+VEGF, into grafts may help to modulate TLR and TH2 activity. In this study, we assessed the graft-generated immune response by examining the expression of TH1 and TH2 cytokines, TLR2, and TLR4. In addition, we measured the expression of transforming growth factor-11 (TGF-1), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that has been documented to modulate TLR activity [McCartney-Francis et al., 2004; Mou et al., 2004] and promote normal bladder tissue growth and development [Baskin et al., 1996]. The regenerative capacity of the implanted grafts was assessed histologically and immunohistochemically (IHC) using bladder tissue-specific markers.

Materials and Methods
Urinary Bladder Decellularization Fresh urinary bladders were harvested from 20- to 50-kg pigs [Brown et al., 2002]. Briefly, bladders were placed in hypertonic solution for 48 h at 4°   C and washed with 1! Hanks' balanced salt solution containing Benzonase (2 U/ml) overnight at 37 ° C. Bladders were then transferred to a 0.25% solution of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) to solubilize membrane proteins. ACMs were repeatedly washed with sterile dH2O and stored in 70% ethanol prior to use. Acellularity was confirmed using H&E staining.
HA and HA+VEGF Construct Preparation ACM was cut into 4 ! 4-cm sections, weighed, and immersed in gradually increasing concentrations of ethanol for full dehydration. It was lyophilized for 24 h, and then rehydrated with increasing concentrations of HA (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/100 ml; H5388, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., USA). Alcian blue staining was used to confirm HA incorporation. HA-ACMs were dehydrated in alcohol, lyophilized, and rehydrated with VEGF121 (V3388, Sigma) 2 ng/g lyophilized ACM for 48 h prior to implantation. ELISA was used previously to confirm VEGF uptake [Cartwright et al., 2006a].
Graft Implantation Eighteen pigs (25­50 kg) were fasted overnight. On the day of surgery, anaesthesia was administered with akmezine and maintained with 1.5% halothane and oxygen on automatic ventilatory support with endotracheal intubation. Intravenous penicillin was administered on induction. ACM, HA-ACM, and HA+VEGF ACM constructs were implanted intraperitoneally onto the anterior and lateral bladder wall through a lower midline incision. Anterior cystectomy was performed and the resultant defects were repaired using ACMs of equivalent size. The corners of the ACMs were marked using non-absorbable sutures (3-0 Prolene). The abdomen was closed in 2 layers, and animals were allowed to recover from anaesthesia and returned to animal pens. Animals were then administered a veterinary antibiotic preparation of penicillin and streptomycin intravenously, and analgesia in the form of Temgesic for 1 week post-operatively. The concentration for penicillin/streptomycin was 100 U/100 lb and that of Temgesic was 0.05­0.1 mg/kg. All doses were administered intravenously. The experimental design consisted of 3 groups: ACM (no HA/ VEGF) as the control group (n = 6 samples), and HA-ACM (n =

6) and HA+VEGF ACM (n = 6) as the experimental groups. Implanted ACMs were recovered after 4 weeks (a time traditionally used to assess immune reactions in acellular grafts) [Gulati and Cole, 1994; Meyer et al., 2005] to examine immune responses, and at 10 weeks to assess cellularity and bladder-specific regeneration [Reddy et al., 2000]. In each group, 3 pigs were designated for week 4, and 3 for week 10.
Recovery of Grafts and Evaluation Pigs were euthanized at 4 and 10 weeks post-implantation. The grafts were harvested from the pig bladders together with a bladder-surrounding margin. The implants were then divided into 2 parts: the centre which represents the ACMs, and the junction which includes the acellular matrix and bladder (ACM-bladder junction). Sections from each part were placed in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Canada) for RNA extraction and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, and fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin for sectioning and IHC staining. The bladder portion of the ACM-bladder junction was used as a reference to compare cellularity, fibrosis, and the regenerative capacity of experimental grafts (ACM, HA-ACM, and HA+VEGF ACM) to normal bladder. This step was carried out to ensure all collected data, including those of normal bladder, were obtained from porcines that underwent surgical implantation. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Hospital for Sick Children, and they were in compliance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care.
Real-Time RT-PCR We assessed immune responses by examining the expression of TH2-specific cytokine IL-4, TH1-specific cytokine IFN-, TLR2, TLR4, and TGF-1 using real-time RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from, approximately, 2 ! 2-cm ACM-bladder junction sites using TRIzol (Invitrogen). All RNA samples were subjected to DNAse treatment prior to RT to reduce endogenous genomic DNA contaminations. RNA concentrations were quantified using UV spectrometry. cDNA was constructed from RNA samples using M-MLV RT (Invitrogen) and oligo-d(T) primers (Ambion). Endogenous genomic DNA contaminations were ruled out using 2% agarose gel and RT­ reactions (without the addition of reverse transcriptase) on various random samples. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) in 20-l reaction wells (Applied Biosystems). All primers used for this study are listed in table 1. Primers were designed using Primer

Expression 2.0 (Applied Biosystems) and porcine-specific sequences were retrieved using GenBank (NCBI). For most of the genes assayed, the intron-exon structures have not been described; therefore, human and mouse sequences were used to assess the homology of the junction sites [Royaee et al., 2004]. All samples including no-template and RT­ controls were run in triplicate. Ct values were extrapolated using an eGFP standard curve and normalized using the geometric means derived from the 2 house-keeping genes, -actin and GAPDH.
Histology and IHC Sections from the ACM were used to assess cellularity, fibrosis and regenerative capacity, while samples from ACM-bladder junctions were used to assess immune response. Three samples from each group (ACM, HA-ACM, and HA+VEGF ACM) underwent histological and IHC staining. We assessed TLR4 response and the regenerative capacity of the grafts using IHC staining for uroplakin III, alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA), and factor VIII (von Willebrand factor). Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometre-thick sections (3 sections per graft) were cut, deparaffinized, and hydrated through xylene and graded concentrations of alcohol. Microwave pretreatment was performed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 3% H2O2/dH2O. For TLR4 sections, non-specific background staining was blocked using 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10% normal donkey serum. The rest of the sections were blocked using an Avidin-Biotin kit and incubated overnight at 4°   C with the following primary antibodies: anti-TLR4 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc12511), uroplakin III mouse anti-bovine (1:200; RDI, PRO65110), -SMA mouse anti-human (1:100; Dako, M0851), and factor VIII anti-human (1:200; Dako, A0082). Sections were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary biotinylated antibodies for 1 h at room temperature as follows: for TLR4, donkey anti-goat (1:400; Santa Cruz, sc-2042); for uroplakin III and -SMA, donkey antimouse IgG (H+L) (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 715-065-151); for factor VIII, goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:150; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Inc., 111-065-003). Slides were washed with PBS and Mix Elite ABC stain (Vector Labs, Burlington, Ont., Canada). The signal was visualized using DAB (Vector Labs). Sections were counter-stained with haematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. High-resolution images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Inflamed porcine bladder was used as a positive control. Negative controls were obtained by staining with secondary antibodies alone. A second negative control for TLR4 was carried out by using 100 l of TLR4-blocking peptide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-12511P) added to 20 l of TLR4 antibody in 380 l PBS, and mixed with 500 l PBS containing 2% BSA to reach a final concentration of 4 g/ml of TLR4 in 1% PBS/BSA29. H&E was used to evaluate cellularity in the ACM, HA-ACM and HA+VEGF ACM groups. Masson's trichrome staining was used to examine the grafts' fibrosis.
CD31 Immunofluorescence Cryosections were cut at a 100-m thickness, treated with DMSO and finally incubated with 10% normal goat serum in 4% BSA/PBS. Three samples from each group (ACM, HA-ACM, and HA+VEGF ACM) were used for immunofluorescence analysis. Tissues were incubated overnight at 4 ° C with primary mouse an-

ti-rat CD31 antibody (1:30; BD Pharmingen, 550300) followed by Alexa Fluor 594 chicken anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:200; Molecular Probes, A-21201) for 2 h at room temperature. Fluorescent mounting medium (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Calif., USA) was used to mount the slides.
Immunofluorescence Scoring CD31 immunostaining images were taken using a Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 confocal scanning microscope (LSM 510 software version 3.2). Simple PCI (Compix, Inc., Sewickley, Pa., USA) was used to estimate microvascular density (m2). A vascular index was created by dividing the microvascular density by the entire area of the tissue studied (m2). Approximately 60 random fields (at 20!) from each graft in every group were used.
Histological and IHC Scoring The grafts' cellularity and factor VIII staining were assessed semi-quantitatively using histology and IHC. Four random focal areas (at 20!, 300 ! 360-m surface area) were examined for their respective staining in all grafts at 10 weeks (4 random focal areas ! 3 grafts, for each condition). For cellularity, positive cell nuclei were scored. For angiogenesis, factor VIII-positive blood vessel stainings were quantified. Scoring analysis was done conjointly by 2 observers (S.E. and Y.L.). All values were averaged for their respective groups.
Statistical Analysis All real-time RT PCR numerical, IHC (semi-quantitative) and immunofluorescence data were analyzed using Student's paired t test (p ! 0.05).
Results
Assessment of Immune Response Using Real-Time RT-PCR Expression of IL-4, IFN-, TLR2, TLR4, and TGF-1 was examined for all 3 groups: ACM alone, HA-ACM, and HA+VEGF ACM at 4 and 10 weeks post-implantation, times traditionally used to assess immune reactions in implanted grafts [Gulati and Cole, 1994; Meyer et al., 2005]. The expression of IL-4, TLR4, and TLR2 was significantly lower in the HA- and HA+VEGF-treated groups compared to the ACM group at week 4 (p ! 0.05). HA+VEGF ACMs displayed 216- and 230-fold decreases in the expression of TLR4 and TLR2, respectively, and minimal IL-4 expression when compared to control ACMs (fig. 1a). IL-4 upregulation in grafts was seen to be correlated with increased expression of TLR4. Both IL-4 and TLR4 were highly expressed in all conditions; however, their expression was significantly lower with HA and HA+VEGF incorporation (fig. 1a). TLR4 expression was 13-, 8-, and 13-fold higher in control ACM, HA-ACM and HA+VEGF ACM grafts, respectively, when compared to TLR2.

IFN- expression was negligible in all 3 groups. Normal porcine bladders showed minimal expression of IL-4, IFN-, TLR4, and TLR2.
At 10 weeks post-implantation, elevated cytokine and TLR expression was persistent in the ACM alone group, and reduced in the HA and HA+VEGF groups; however, these results were not statistically significant (fig.  1b). Differences in TLR or IL-4 expression between week 4 and week 10 values in HA- and HA+VEGF-treated grafts were non-significant. In the ACM alone group, reduced TH2 and TLR expression was observed at week 10 when compared to week 4.
Expression of TGF-1 Was Inversely Correlated with TLR4 Expression TGF-1 was highly expressed in the HA+VEGF-treated group when compared to the ACM control and HAtreated grafts at 4 and 10 weeks. We found a 7- and 9-fold increase in TGF-1 expression in HA+VEGF groups when compared to ACM alone and HA grafts, respectively, at 4 weeks. TGF-1 expression in the HA+VEGF grafts group remained markedly higher at 10 weeks (fig. 2).

expression was observed in the HA and HA+VEGF groups at both 4 and 10 weeks (fig. 3). These results were consistent with real-time RT-PCR. TLR4 was detected in the cytoplasm and membrane of urothelial cells. No expression was observed in bladder muscles. The addition of TLR4-blocking peptide to neutralize antibody-TLR4 binding resulted in an absence of TLR4 staining in the urothelium.

Assessment of Graft Regenerative Capacity and Angiogenesis The regenerative capacity of grafts was assessed by staining for bladder urothelium (uroplakin III) and SMA (smooth muscles) after 10 weeks [Reddy et al., 2000]. Additionally, angiogenesis was evaluated by examining factor VIII at 10 weeks post-implantation [Reddy et al., 2000]. HA and HA+VEGF groups demonstrated enhanced cellularity and reduced fibrosis, relative to the ACM alone group, as indicated by H&E and Masson's trichrome staining (fig. 4, 5). As for graft regenerative capacity, a greater percentage of -SMA- and uroplakin IIIpositive staining cells was observed in the HA+VEGF and ACM alone groups, but not in the HA-ACM grafts (fig. 6). Further assessment of grafts for the endothelial cell marker factor VIII demonstrated a higher expression of factor VIII in HA+VEGF- and HA-treated groups, relative to the ACM alone group (fig. 6). Semi-quantitative analysis showed significantly greater cellularity in

HA+VEGF ACMs when compared to the HA-treated and ACM alone groups (fig. 7a) and a greater occurrence of factor VIII-positive blood vessels in HA+VEGF groups when compared to ACM alone (fig. 7c).
CD31 Vascular Index CD31 evaluation of graft angiogenesis revealed a statistically significant increase (p ! 0.05) in the vascular index of the HA and HA+VEGF groups, relative to ACM alone, demonstrating higher microvessel density (fig. 7b, 8).
Discussion
Bladder ACM grafts are ECM-derived natural bioscaffolds that promote organ-specific tissue regeneration [Brown et al., 2002]. Obtained from the de-cellularization of native bladder, ACMs are thought to harbour appropri-

ate environmental cues that trigger bladder-specific regenerative responses and therefore represent a superior alternative to bladder replacement, and may help to reduce clinical complications that arise with the current practice of gastrointestinal segment use for bladder substitutions.
There is limited knowledge on the role of the immune system upon implantation of natural scaffolds. ACMs elicit a CD4+ TH2-specific immune response [Allman et al., 2002], characteristic of graft acceptance. However, T cell-dependent TH2-specific immune cells were not re-

quired in constructive remodelling and acceptance of these grafts [Allman et al., 2002], suggesting other immune cells including M2 macrophage populations are involved in graft healing and repair [Badylak et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2009; Valentin et al., 2009]. In this study, we sought to examine factors that may contribute to the polarization of the host immune response toward a specific cascade during the implantation of ACMs.
The innate immune system plays a significant role in driving the adaptive immune response toward a specific TH cascade [Goldstein and Tesar, 2004; Krutzik et al.,

compared to ACM alone (a) (p ! 0.05). Higher vessel density was observed in HA+VEGF ACM compared to HA-ACM. Primary mouse anti-rat antibody was decteted with Alexa Fluor 594 chicken anti-mouse IgG. Scale denotes 100 m (confocal).

2005; Netea et al., 2005]. TLRs of the innate immune system can recognize various ECM molecules and have shown a potential to influence TH polarization in the adaptive immune response [Medzhitov and Janeway, 2000; Ohashi et al., 2000; Li et al., 2001; Termeer et al., 2002; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004; Saemann et al., 2005]. TLRs, present in dendritic cells, macrophages and leukocytes, are involved in initiating intracellular signal transduction pathways that result in the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-B, resulting in the expression of genes involved in inflammation [Land, 2005; Takeda and Akira, 2005]. TLRs also trigger the release of

pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, with recruitment of macrophages, neutrophils and T cells, overall activating a specific TH cascade, leading to full-scale adaptive immune responses [Takeda and Akira, 2005]. Upregulation of TLR activity has also been observed with the implantation of various tissues [Goldstein et al., 2003; Goldstein and Tesar, 2004; Methe et al., 2004]. However, the precise role of TLR activity, specifically in the context of natural acellular scaffolds, in directing and triggering the adaptive immune response has not yet been investigated.

Although bladder ACMs have shown extensive biocompatibility and re-cellularization by host-derived cells, our previous studies concluded that naturally implanted grafts remain susceptible to vigorous inflammatory reactions, a low muscle-to-collagen ratio, and interstitial fibrosis after a 22-week assessment [Cartwright et al., 2006b]. ACM fibrosis has also been observed with the implantation of various commercially modified ACMs [Badylak and Gilbert, 2008]. In this study, we intended to investigate factors that may contribute to an inflammatory response and fibrotic deposition upon implantation of original and modified grafts in a porcine model at 4 and 10 weeks. We modified our original scaffolds by reconstitution with HA to improve bladder tissue regeneration. HA is known to be completely resorbable when subjected to enzymatic degradation, expressing angiogenic properties [Slevin et al., 2002]. Previously, we have shown that HA serves as an effective biomimetic molecule in reducing matrix porosity, preventing urine leakage and possible graft inflammation [Cartwright et al., 2006b]. In addition, we incorporated VEGF into our HA-ACM constructs. VEGF is a strong angiogenic mitogen that plays a prominent role in microvascular endothelial cell migration and capillary development [Hoeben et al., 2004]. Because it regulates vascular permeability, VEGF has been used to enhance angiogenesis in tissue engineering [Murphy et al., 2000].
Our results demonstrated an extensive increase in the expression of TH2-specific cytokine IL-4, TLR4, and TLR2 in bladder ACMs at 4 weeks post-implantation. Increased IL-4 occurred concomitantly with upregulation in TLR4 expression, which may suggest that TLR4 may be a key player involved in triggering TH2 immune response [Redecke et al., 2004]. We observed minimal expression of TH1-specific cytokine IFN- among ACM alone, HA-ACM and HA+VEGF ACM groups [Allman et al., 2001, 2002]. TH2 and TLR expression was reduced at week 10 when compared to week 4 in the ACM alone group. The reduced immunological expression obtained at week 10 may correspond to the period of graft acceptance [Allman et al., 2002], characteristic of reduced remodelling and immune reactions, which may explain why we did not observe a statistically significant difference between the groups at week 10 (fig. 1b). TLR and IL-4 expression at week 10 may represent basal immune levels observed with the implantation of all natural grafts (ACM alone, HA-ACM, and HA+VEGF ACM) and of the native bladder itself [Samuelsson et al., 2004]. TLR activity may also be respon-

sible for regulating not only TH1/TH2 immune responses, but also M1/M2 macrophage polarization, which has shown to play an active role during ACM implantation [Badylak et al., 2008; Brown et al., 2009; Valentin et al., 2009]. Suppression of TLR activity may help to modulate adaptive immune responses, suggesting functionally distinct roles between the adaptive and innate immune system in response to the implantation of natural scaffolds.
Furthermore, we validated our real-time RT-PCR results using IHC. Urothelium derived from the control ACM-alone implanted grafts showed an overall stronger staining than HA and HA+VEGF-incorporated ACMs at 4 and 10 weeks, parallel with real-time RT-PCR results (fig. 3). Our observations were consistent with Samuelsson et al. [2004], demonstrating TLR4 expression in normal bladder urothelial cells and the absence of it in the muscular and submucosal regions. It is possible that reduced TLR activity with HA and HA+VEGF incorporation may negatively impact the bladder's native defence system. Allman et al. [2002] demonstrated that TH2-restricted adaptive immune response induced by xenogeneic ECM implantation did not compromise immune function and small intestinal submucosal implantation did not increase susceptibility to viral or bacterial pathogenic agents. However, modulation of the innate immune system in response to native bladder defence requires further analysis.
In addition, we evaluated the expression of TGF-1, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that can modulate TLR activity [McCartney-Francis et al., 2004] and promote normal bladder tissue growth and development [Baskin et al., 1996]. TGF-1 has also been shown to be a powerful chemoattractant that impacts cell migration, proliferation and differentiation [Faler et al., 2006; Rolfe et al., 2007]. Recently, TGF-1 has been reported to exert potent pro-angiogenic activity against human microvascular endothelial cells [Serrati et al., 2009] through multiple signal transduction pathways involving upregulation of VEGF by TGF-1 [Clifford et al., 2008]. We observed an upregulation in TGF-1 expression after 4 and 10 weeks in the HA+VEGF ACM grafts when compared to the ACM alone controls and HA grafts (fig.  2). We speculate that TGF-'s anti-inflammatory properties may provide a more dominant therapeutic outcome leading to reduced matrix deposition [Shull et al., 1992; Kulkarni et al., 1993].
Cellularity and regenerative capacity of grafts was assessed using H&E, Masson's trichrome stain and IHC staining for urinary bladder-specific markers. We noted

greater cellularity and reduced collagen deposition in the HA+VEGF ACM grafts when compared to the control groups (fig. 4, 5, 7a). Semi-quantitative analysis of histological staining revealed greater cellularity in the HA+VEGF groups when compared to HA and ACM alone (fig. 4); similar findings have been observed following local VEGF administration in sheep [Yoshikawa et al., 2006]. The expression and intensity of -SMA, uroplakin III, and factor VIII were higher in HA and HA+VEGF ACMs when compared to ACM alone (fig. 6). In addition, immunofluorescence analysis for the angiogenic marker, CD31, confirmed a significantly greater vascular index in HA-ACMs and HA+VEGF ACMs in contrast to ACMs alone (fig. 7b, 8). Higher TGF-1 expression in HA+VEGF grafts may be due to increased blood vessel development [Jennings et al., 1988; Pelton et al., 1991; Kojima et al., 2000], consistent with higher angiogenesis in HA+VEGF grafts demonstrated in CD31 immunofluorescence and factor VIII IHC and semi-quantitative scoring (fig. 7). Overall, our findings have shown that the incorporation of HA+VEGF into ACMs significantly increases the overall regenerative capacity of grafts and reduces immunological complications, leading to successful graft remodelling. Nevertheless, future work with specific temporal and spatial analysis of the implants is necessary to confirm these findings.

Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated that the incorporation of biomimetic material, HA and HA+VEGF, into bladder ACMs may help modulate host immune responses by specifically reducing IL-4 and TLR4 expression and promoting TGF-1, leading to reduced graft fibrosis and inflammation. We observed reduced collagen deposition, greater cellularity, and smooth muscle and urothelial cell regeneration, and angiogenesis with the incorporation of HA+VEGF. It is possible that HA may play a significant role in modulating immune responses, as minimal differences between HA and HA+VEGF grafts were observed with respect to an immune reaction, while incorporation of VEGF may be involved, primarily, in enhancing and promoting cellularization, regeneration, and angiogenesis. Combination of both biomimetic materials, HA and VEGF, may help them to complement each other and provide a background for optimal graft regeneration and modulation of immune reactions. The regenerative capacity of grafts was found to be inversely proportional to TLR and IL-4 expression. To our knowledge, this research was the first study to identify one possible mechanism behind host-derived immune responses following the implantation of natural scaffolds. This may be helpful in identifying methods to modulate host immune responses leading to better outcomes in different tissue engineering strategies utilizing natural scaffolds.
