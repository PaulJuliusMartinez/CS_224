SELECTED COMBINATORIAL RESEARCH PROBLEMS
bY V. Chvatal, D. A. Klarner, and D. E. Knuth
Abstract Thirty-seven research problems are described, covering a wide
range of combinatorial topics. Unlike Hilbert's problems, most of these are not especially famous and they might be "do-able" in the
--. next few years.
(Problems l-16 were contributed by Klarner, 17-26 by Chvatal, 27-37 by Knuth. All cash awards are Chva'tal's responsibility.)

Problem 1. Consider the set (2x+1,3x+1: 1) defined to be the smallest set
of natural numbers which contai.ns 1 and is closed under the operations
x + 2x+1 or 3x+1 . The set can be constructed by iterating these
operations as indicated in the following tree. I*
--6 . .
I Michael Fredman showed in his thesis that this set has density 0
i
in the set of all natural numbers; hence, S = (2x+1,3x+1: 1) does not I? L_ contain an infinite arithmetic progression. Let N denote the set of
L all natural numbers. Is it true that N\S may be expressed as a disjoint union of infinite arithmetic progressions?
Problem 2. Milner's Problem (Robin Milner at Stanford A. I. project) i Let Bn denote the set of aU binary sequences of length n .
Suppose m <- n , &Bn , ikBm , and let V(&t) denote the number of L : subsequences of 2 equal to 5 . The m-list of &Bn consists of a
knowledge of the numbers v(a,6) for all 6eB . How large must m be Lm
such that the m-lists for all elements &Bn are distinct? This is Milner's problem. Chvatal, Rivest, and Klarner have obtained some results on this problem. A related problem is the following. There are many identities connecting the V'S . For example, let Bm n
9 denote a 2m~2n matrix with b i,j defined to be V(i,j)(n-m)! where
1

f and 3 denote the binary sequences of length n and m used to

represent i and j respectively. Then it is easy to check that

Br,sBs,t

=Brt Y

.

Many other identities exist which seem to be -.

algebraically independent of these. For example, v&(11)) = (v(a;(l))) .

The problem is to find a basis for all algebraic identities relating the

numbers V&G) for fixed g , as $ ranges over all binary sequences.

c Problem 3.
Recently, Ron Rivest and David Klarner succeeded in showing that
a < 4.65 , where a = lim(a(n))+ and a(n) denotes the number of L -e. n+ao
L connected square-celled animals with n cells. In fact, we designed a procedure for calculating numbers a+~~,... such that Q < a i+l < aa1
iI for all i . We were unable to prove, but conjecture that ll. -i+mco ai=a .
I Prove or disprove our conjecture. Try to beat our upper bound a < 4.65 .

upper bound for the number of n-ominoes," CS 263, Computer Science
Department, Stanford University, February 1972.
Problem 4.
Give a "sieve formula" for enumerating planted plane trees having
- certain subtrees excluded. The n-omino enumeration problem is a special
case of this problem.

Problem 5.
More on plane trees. A famous problem in probability theory (solved, by the way) asks for the probability that a candidate always

2

has at least j/k of the votes cast. Here is a related enumeration problem. How many binary sequences (al,a2,...,akn) of length kn containing exactly jn ones satisfy the conditions

a1 + . ..+akn 1 jm "for m = l,...,n ?

When j =l, the solution is

Problem 6.
Give-a simple proof that if a rectangle is cut into three congruent n-ominoes, then the n-omino is a rectangle.
L Problem 7. c. Find the smallest number x > 0 , such that copies of the Y-pentomino
pack a 12x 5x rectangle. Klarner holds the record
FE9 with x = 16 .

Problem 8. Every 3-celled animal on the line packs some interval. An example
of a 3-celled animal and an interval it packs: c
the interval

the animal

the animal's reflection
3

Translations of the animal and its reflection are used in the packing.

Here gaps between the cells are 1 and 2 , and the length of the

smallest interval the animal can pack has length 1(1,2) = 18 . If .
the gaps between the cells are m and n in a three-celled animal, it

L can be shown that the length of the smallest interval the animal can
pack e(m,n) is bounded above by l+3m+n . This proof depends on the

following algorithm: Suppose m < n , let A denote the animal with

t gap m on the left, and let B denote the animal with gap m on the

right. We pack a one-way infinite strip of cells as follows. Fill the
c

first cell with the left-most cell of A . Fill the left-most unfilled

i L

cell in thestrip with the left-most cell of A , if there is overlap

1 remove A and try B . It is an interesting exercise to show that this procedure results in a packing of an interval whose length is not
I fr;reater than 1-t 3m+n . Let a(m,n) denote the length of the interval

packed by this algorithm. Give a nice upper bound on R(m,n) , and find

out if it satisfies some kind of recurrence relation.

Problem 9.

Does every b-celled animal in the plane pack the plane? Does every

?-celled animal in the plane pack the plane? There is at least one

-

1 G-celled animal that does not pack the plane, namely,

.

k!l

A 3n-celled animal like this one can be constructed which does not pack En . Thus, if every n-celled animal packs Ek , then n < 3k e Improve this upper bound if possible.

the x- or y-axis. Let a(S) denote the area covered by the union of suchaset S. Is it true that"

Problem 12. An extremal problem (see problem 5728 of Amer. Math.
--.
Monthly, 1970).
The "octahedron" in En has 2n-l different pairs of parallel i hyperplanes spanned by two n-sets whose union comprises the vertex set
of the octahedron. Prove that the octahedron is an optimal configuration L of 2n points in En having the property that the points span many lil pairs of parallel hyperplanes.
Problem 13.
CL R. C. Read (J. London Math. Sot., 1963, 99-104) enumerated classes
of isomorphic self-complementary linear graphs with 4n vertices and classes of isomorphic self-complementary directed graphs with 2n
c- vertices. It turns out that these numbers are equal. Give a "natural"
one-one correspondence between the two sets.

c Recently, Klarner showed that the set S = (m1x1 + . ..+mrxr: 1) L
(that is, the smallest set of natural numbers which contains 1 and is
C closed under the operation "1x1" . ..+mrxr where ml,...'m, are given c natural numbers) is a finite union of infinite arithmetic progressions
c provided (i) r 2 2 , (ii) (m+;'m,) = 1 , and
(iii) (ml...mr,ml+ . ..+mr) = 1 . Does the conclusion still follow
c if we drop hypothesis (iii)?

fb- Problem 17.
The ordinary game of tic-tat-toe is an instance of a positional game played on a hypergraph H = (V,E) . Here V (the set of vertices of H )
Lb is a finite set and E (the set of edges of H ) is a set of subsets
of v . Two players take turns to claim a previously unclaimed vertex of H . If a player claims all the vertices of an edge of H , he wins. i If all the vertices of II have been claimed but no one has yet won then the game is a draw. An easy argument (Hales and Jewett, "Regularity and
7

r,

positional games," Trans. Amer. Math. SOC. 106 (1963), 222-229) shows

that the second player cannot have a winning strategy. Besides, if the

game results in a draw then there is a partition V = Vl U V2 such that

L no V.1 contains an edge (in tha< case, H is called 2-colorable). Q Given positive integers n , k with k 5 n we define a hypergraph
L W(n,k) by setting V = {1,2,...,n} *and letting a set A c V to be an

element of E if, and only if, 1 A 1 = k and the elements of A form
c- an arithmetic progression. Van der Waerden (Beweis einer Baudetschen

Vermutung, Nieuw Archief v. Wiskunde 15 (1928), 212-216) proved that given

any k there is always an n such that W(n,k) is not 2-colorable.

Let N(k) -be the smallest such n . It is easy to show that N(2) L- j

and N( 3) = 9 ; one has N(4) = 35 (see Chvatal, "Some unknown van der

Waerden numbers," Combinatorial Structures and Their Applications (R. K. Guy

et al., Eds.), Gordon and Breach, New York, 1970). As far as I know, the

value of N(5) is still unknown. The existing upper bounds on N(k) are

beyond the range of algebraic expressions. The existence of N(k) implies
L the existence of the smallest n = n(k) such that the first player has

a winning strategy on

W(n,k)

l

Obviously, we have n(k)-<N(k) . One

has n(3) = 5 and n('l) = 15 (ccc ChvjLal, "Hypergraphs and Ramscyian
L
theorems," Thesis, University of Waterloo, 19'70). Apparently, N(k) is

a rather poor upper bound for

n(k)

l

What is the value of n(5) ? Can you find a decent upper bound
i
for n(k) ? Is n(k) always odd? If so, is $ (n(k)+l) a winning

first move? Is there a winning strategy for the first player on W(n,k)

for all n >- n(k) ?

Problem 18.
i A k-graph is a hypergraph (V,E) with IA! = k for all AeE . Let
L
m(k) be the smallest IEI in a k-graph which is not 2-colorable.
i Obviously, m(2) = 3 . It is no+, difficult to show that m(3) = 7 ; e the edges of the corresponding 3-graph are the lines of a projective
plane of order two. One has 2k(l+ 2k-l)-' < m(k) < rk2 2k ev2 log 2/(1+ (1+2p))l .

(Herzog and Schijnheim, "The Br property and chromatic numbers of generalized graphs,'* J. Combinatorial Theory 12 (1972), 41-49, improving 2k-l < m(k) < k22k+1 due to Erd&.)
C- -=.
Erd'ds repeatedly asks for the value of m(4) . Perhaps a computer would help.
Problem 19. A graph G is called hypohamiltonian if it contains no hamiltonian
circuit (that is, a circuit passing through all the vertices of G ), but given any vertex u of G , the vertex-deleted subgraph G-u has a hamiltonian circuit. The smallest hypohamiltonian graph is the Petersen graph.
9

He=, Duby and Vig& ("Recherche Syst&natique des Graphes Hypohamiltonians,"
Q Theory of Graphs (P. Rosenstiehl, Ed.), 1966) used a computer to search
L.
for hypohamiltonian graphs with 11 or 12 vertices and found that

there are none. However, they discovered one with 13 and another one

with 15 vertices. Since then, the existence of hypohamiltonian graphs

with n vertices has been demonstrated for all n ->13 except for
n = 14, 17, 191 2% 25
e- (see Ch&al, '*Flip-flops in hypohamiltonian graphs,'* to appear in

Canad. Math. Dull.). Perhaps it is time to settle at least the case

n = 14 (computers could help).
c- The h~ohamiltonian graphs offer a number of amusing questions. It

seems that these graphs never contain a circuit of length three or four.
L
However, so far no one has found any graph F such that no hypohamiltonian
5 graph contains F . I offer $5.00 for an example of a planar hypo-

hamiltonian graph or a proof that there is none.

L Problem 20.

A graph G is called t-tough if deletion of any m points from G

results in a graph that is either connected or else has at most m/t

L components. It is not difficult to see that every hamiltonian graph

lis l-tough but the converse is not true (the Petersen graph is 3-4 -tough).

I offer $10

& for the proof that every t-tough graph is hamiltonian

and $10 lt+1m for an example of a t-tough graph (t > 35) which is not

hamiltonian.

Fleischner ("Square of a block is hamiltonian," to appear in J.

Combinatorial Theory) proved that the squares of a 2-connected graph is

always hamiltonian. (The square G2 of a graph G is defined to be the

10

graph having the same vertices as G ; vertices u , v are adjacent in G2 if and only if they have distance at most two in G .) Since the square of a k-connected graph is always k-tough, it is desirable to prove that every 2-tough graph is hamiltonian. An example of a
CL 23 -tough nonhamiltonian graph is obtained when in the Petersen graph,
each vertex is replaced by a triangle as indicated below.

Some results on toughness are contained in a forthcoming paper of mine, to appear in Discrete Mathematics.

Problem 21.
L
A unit distance graph is one whose vertices can be represented by points in the Euclidean plane in such a way that adjacent vertices are
L'- represented by points having distance one. Obviously, the unit distance
graphs can be characterized by forbidden subgraphs. It is easy to show
.
that the unit distance graphs contain neither K4 nor
K2,3 l
L
11

F LL
Let us denote by f(n) the largest possible number of edges in a unit
L
distance graph with n vertices. One has f(3) = 3 , f(4) = 5 J
tb
C f(6) = 9 . Obviously, if Gl = (Vl,El) and G2 = (V2,E2) are unit
distance graphs then GlxG2 (defined as (VlxV2,E) with
c- CC xlJx2)9(~l,~2)3 EE iff either x1 = yl y [x2,y2} eE2 or else
x2 = Y2 J [xl,yl] E El ) is a unit distance graph. Therefore f(mn) 2 mf(n)+nf(m) and so f(n) > cn log n . On the other hand, the absence of K in unit distance graphs implies quite easily that f(n) < cn3/2 y"Erd8s asked whether f(n) = o(n312) .
L
Klarner has observed that, for any representation of the circuit C4 of length four, the opposite edges must be parallel, and that this fact can be used to construct more forbidden subgraphs. For instance, the graph below is not a unit distance graph: xu is parallel to yv and so dist(u,v) = dist(x,y) = 1 .
Nevertheless, there are graphs with n vertices and cn312 edges
which do not contain even a c4 l These can be obtained by assigning
vertices to all the points and lines of a projective plane and joining a point-vertex to a line-vertex if and only if the line passes through the point. Thus a geometry of order m gives rise to a (bipartite)
12

graph having total of 2(m2+m+1) vertices and (m+l)(m2+m+l) edges, containing no c4 l I suspect that these graphs are not unit distance graphs but have not proved it even for m = 2 .
Problem 22. For any finite graph F (without isolated vertices) we define r(F)
to be the smallest N such that, for every graph G with N vertices,
1- either G or its complement G contains F . Obviously, r(F) L an>
where F has n vertices and Kn is the complete graph with n vertices. Hence the existence of r(F) for every F follows from Ramsey's theorem. Erd8s conjectures that Kn minimizes r(F) among L
L all n-chromatic graphs F and suggests to test this conjecture on the wheel W4 .

Among many equivalent formulations of the four-color conjecture,
L

there is a recent one which deserves special interest. Unlike in most

other cases, the proof of the equivalence is nontrivial and so it may

constitute the first step towards the solution of &X . Given any graph

G = (V,E) and a set S c V , we denote by 3s the number of edges

having exac-. tly one endpoint in S . A function w: V 3 c-2,+2) is called a balanced coloring if

as -> c w(x) xd3

for all S c V . Bondy ("Balanced colourings and the four colour conjecture," to appear in Proc. Amer. Math. Sot.) proved that the four
I, color conjecture is equivalent to the following "balanced coloring
conjecture": Every bridgeless cubic planar graph admits a balanced coloring.
c' (A cubic graph is one where each vertex meets exactly three edges; a
bridgeless graph is one which remains connected after the deletion of an arbitrary edge.) One can think of the vertices x with w(x) = -2
c as being colored blue and those with w(x) = 2 as colored red. A balanced
coloring of a cubic graph has two simple but interesting properties: (i) the number of blue vertices equals the number of red ones,
c (ii) there is no nonchromatic path with three vertices.
It would be nice to prove that every bridgeless cubic planar graph admits

14

a coloring with properties (i), (ii). Besides, it may be useful to study balanced colorings in the class of all graphs, not necessarily bridgeless cubic planar ones.

Problem 24.
c
Let dl ,> d2 > -. . . > dn be nonnegative integers. What are the
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a planar graph

with n vertices having degrees dl, d2, . . ..dn ? Thi s question appears to be quite deep. When the planarity assumption is dropped, the answer

becomes quite simple: the sum of all dils must be even and the

inequality 5. `L

Unlike the general (purely combinatorial) case, the planar problem exhibits peculiar irregularities. When dealing with the simplest case, `11 =d2 = . . . n=d =d, EUer's formula (resp. (1) with k = n )

15

forces d 5 5 and n >m12 . These conditions, together with the trivial dn = even , turn out to be sufficient apart from two exceptionalcases: d=4, n=7 and d=5, n=lk. It would be interesting to go deeper into the structure of the problem and find more
c subtle additional conditions that would exclude the two exceptional
cases.
Problem 25. A finite family F of finite sets is called an independence system if XeF,Y c X ti YEF .
A family of sets is called intersecting if it contains no two disjoint sets. It is called a star if all of its sets have at least one element in common. For example, the family
53 9 11) 9 f2) Y c33 Y 023, [1,33, [2,3]
is an independence system; its subfamily
Cl3 2 CL21 Y Cl,33
is a star (and therefore intersecting), the subfamily w4 Y CL33 I C&33
- is intersecting but not a star. I offer $10.00 for a proof or a disproof of the following conjecture. Among the largest intersecting subfamilies of an independence system, there is always a star. Naturally, I am not going to pay anything for the degenerate "counterexampler' F = [($]] . Decent as we are, we are interested in independence systems F with IFI 2 2 . Without loss of generality, we can assume that the sets in F are sets of positive integers. Then we write X <Y if, and only if, there is a one-to-one mapping
16

f:X-+Y with f(t) >t for each teX . I can prove the above conjecture
L
for rather special independence systems, namely, those which satisfy
c
XeF,Y <X 3 YeF .
In its full generality, the. . problem appears to be quite difficult. C I am rather skeptical about the use of counting arguments. It would be
Q
interesting to prove the conjecture for independence systems whose
maximal sets are lines of a projective plane.
Problem 26.
In the 193O*s, Miss Esther Klein asked whether there is a function
F(n) such that from any F(n) points in the plane (no three collinear)
one can always choose n+l of them which are the vertices of a convex
polygon. Erdiis and Szekeres ("A combinatorial problem in geometry,"
Compositio Math. 2 (1935), 463-470) proved F(n) 5 (F-T)+1 ; subsequently
Szekeres married Miss Klein. Komlo's and I proved a more general result
("Some combinatorial theorems on monotonicity," Canad. Math. Bull. 14
(1971), 151-157) which goes as follows. Let f be an arbitrary realI
L valued f'unction defined on the edges of a directed graph D which contains no directed cycles. If the vertices of D cannot be colored in (2nn-12>
L` colors then there is a directed path with n edges el,e2, . . ., en such
that the sequence f(e1),f(e2),f(e2),..,f(en) is monotone. (The specialization is clear: the points in plane can be ordered by their
L first coordinate, D becomes a transitive tournament and f is the
slope function.) The bound F(n) 5 (2nn'-:)+l is not sharp; one has
F(3) = 5 , F(4) = 9 . I wonder if the last equality carries through
c to the abstract setting. The abstract version of the problem (more
messy but more faithful than the first one) can be set up as follows.
c 17

Let f be an arbitrary real-valued function defined on the set

{(i,j): 15 i < j SN) ;
B
L perhaps we should assume

(2)

min(f(iyj)J(jyk)) <- f(W) <- m&f(i,j),f(j,k)) for all 15 i < j < k IN . By an n-gon, we shall mean a pair of sequences (i1' i2Y . . ..in> y (jlyj,y~~.,js) with r,s 2 2 such that

il < i2 < . . . < ir

and i1 = j, , ir = js , r+s-2 = n . Let G(n) denote the smallest
i
L N such that every function f defined on (2) gives rise to an

Q (n+l)-gon. Obviously, F(n) <- G(n) ; the theorem of Komlds and myself
L
shows that G(n) ,< (Flf)+l . It is not difficult to show that G(3) = 5 .

Indeed, let f be an arbitrary real-valued function defined on

L f(i,j): l_< i < j < 5) . Without loss of generality, we can assume

f&2)

-<

f(2,3)

l

Now, let us assume that f gives rise to no 4-gon.

Then we necessarily have - step by step -

L` fPY3) > f(3Y4) because of (L2Y 314) Y (L4)

f(3Y4) < f(4Y5) because of (2,5)&3,4,5)

w-,3) > f(3,5) because of (w,3,5L (lr5) L WY 4) > f(4Y5) because of (%4,5) Y (2,315)

f(W) < WY 4) because of OY5ML2,4,5)

f(L3) < f(314) because of h9%4), (1,3,4)
c
and so finally (1,3,~,5),(1,5) is a 4-gon; contradiction.

IS G(4) = 9 and, more generally, G(n) = F(n) for all n ?

that every positive or, (if you prefer, nonnegative, or arbitrary)

It is clear that if D = idly . . ..dloj has this property, then so
c- does 0 = [adl,...,~dlo] for any real a > 0 . This will be implicitly
understood below.
If OcD and all di are >- 0 then we can deduce that
D = {O,l, my93 . It is also known that D can be chosen to be
{x,x+1,x+2,...,x+93 for any x , -9<xjl.
As an instance of the latter, take the symmetric case where

Finally, it should be remarked that we require D to have ten

elements, since Ron Graham proved that if it had fewer, the set of numbers

representable as (*) is a set of measure zero. It is not difficult,

however, to construct sets D with as few as three elements which give

rise via (*T to a set of numbers dense on the positive real axis, even

if we stipulate that ak = 0 for all k < 0 . Such an example is L2

Problem 28. Sorting by Deques L The problem is to investigate the permutations that can be obtained
from a general deque starting with the permutation 1,2,...,n as input. For example, one would like to know a simple test for deciding whether
L. or not a given permutation can be so obtained. Another interesting
question is to count the number of permutations thus obtainable, by recurrence, generating function, and/or asymptotic formula.
L For a definition of deque, related problems, and a description of
techniques that have been found useful in attacking them, see Section 2.2.1 and the following problems in D. Knuth "Fundamental Algorithms" (p. 234).*

obtainable if and only if it contains none of these special permutations.
Problem 29. Dragon Curve The "dragon design" is obtained by repeatedly folding a sheet of
paper in on--.e direction and then unfolding it so that each of the creases forms a fixed angle 8 . For a more precise definition and many interesting properties of this curve, see the article: *Number representations
and dragon curves ' by Chandler Davis and D. E. Knuth, J. Recreational Math. 3 (197o)y 66-81, 133-149.
It is experimentally observed that there is a greatest angle Q. ,
L between 90" and 100' , such that for Q. < 0 -< 180' the dragon curve
does not have any self-intersections. The problem is to determine Q. . Some experimentation indicates that the "crucial points", where
L self-intersection is likely, OCCUT at the B(5*2n) and $(ll02~) .
Problem 30. Posets and Permutations We consider a partially ordered set P , such as the one drawn below.
where we use arrows to indicate the ordering relations. 21

L We also label the points of P in a particular way, consistent

fb with their relative order with the integers l,...,n ; that is, we
L
require that if i --) j , then i <- j .
The problem now is to find-.an efficient algorithm for determining

the permutation of the labels 1,2 ,...,n which gives a labelling

still consistent with the partial order of P , but which has a maximal

number of inversions. (An inversion of a permutation p1 . ..pn is two

For the above example we easily find that the desired permutation

is uniquely pl . ..p = 147258369 . 9
Another way to veiw this problem (obtaining the inverse permutation,

which has the same number of inversions) is to consider any method of i removing the points of the graph one at a time, never removing a point

until its predecessors have been removed. The idea is to maximize the number of inversions in the output. The example

LL shows that it is not sufficient simply to remove the largest possible element first (1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4 has more inversions than 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6 ). [This problem was inspired by computer sorting.]

Problem 32. Counting leftist trees
.-
In what follows we consider only binary trees (with left distinguished

from right); a leaf node has no sons, and a nonleaf node has 2 sons.

We assign to each vertex of a binary tree a weight by proceeding as

L- follows. We first assign 0 to all leaves. Then we climb up the tree by the rule that if the two sons of a node have been given weights x

and y , the node itself receives the weight min(x,y)+l .

Now such a weighted binary tree is called leftist if for each node,

the son situated to the left has a weight at least as great as the son

situated to the right. The constraints can be symbolized by

L 1. x -> y .

L 23

The picture below shows a leftist tree.

: i/+ Intuitively leftist trees are characterized by the fact that to go from rc` any node to the nearest leaf it suffices to proceed always to the right.
The problem then is to compute the asymptotic growth of an , the number
i
of leftist trees with n leaves.

i
A similar problem can be asked about the situation where we modify
I the above as follows. If the two sons of a node have weights x and y ,
i then the node itself has weight max(x,y)+l . A binary tree so weighted
L is called balanced if the weights of the two sons of any node differ by I at most one. Thus, the constraints now are

L I x-yI 51 .

It is known that the "Fibonacci trees" are the balanced trees with
L the minimal number of nodes for a given height h . (The height of a
tree is the weight at the root.) The Fibonacci trees Tn are given by

To=. , Tl =

and Tn =

Also the number of distinct balanced trees with height h is known c to grow as C 2h where C is a positive (unknown) constant. (Balanced
trees are sometimes known by the less desirable term "AVL trees".) What is the asymptotic number of balanced trees with n leaves?

Problem 34. A basic equivalence relation on graphs.
Find an efficient algorithm for computing the weak components of a

Problem 37. Random growth of 3-2 trees.
Analyze the probability that various numbers of splits will occur during; random insertion into (3,2) trees as the trees become large.
c A (5,2) tree is a tree in which every node may be a leaf or else it has 2 or 3 sons. One may write (3,2) trees as follows:

leaving a node indicate possible results of comparing another data item with those in a node. For example, a node containing only one item x can yield only two results for new incoming y , either y < x or y>x. In a node of form Yw Fe aTs s u m e x1 <x2 . A l s o ,
a bC all items y in subtree a are smaller than x1 ; in b they are between x1 and x2 ; and in c they are larger than x2 l Similarly
all items in subtree a are smaller than x1 and ab all items in subtree b are larger than x1 . Now, we consider only (3,2) trees with this ordering on their items and whose leaves are all at the same level. We insert by introducing items randomly at the positions of the leaves. (The leaves represent equiprobable gaps between existing items.) We insert by a sequence of operations local to various nodes along the path to the root. For example, to insert x' in place of leaf a in
_-_- -< . . - ___x__-.

ab we get
