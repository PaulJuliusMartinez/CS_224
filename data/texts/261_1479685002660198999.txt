from 20 to 85%, depending  on the species compared, possibly 
explaining  the  observed  overlap  in some  of  their  biological 
and immunological properties  ( N i d  et al., 1973). DNA com- 
(Seeburg  et  al.,  1977), human  GH 
plementary  to  rat  GH’ 
(Martial et  al.,  1979), and  human  CS  (Shine et  al.,  1977) 
mRNAs  have  been  cloned  and  sequenced  recently.  More 
homology  was found  between  the  nucleic  acid  sequences  of 
hGH and hCS, than between those of hGH  and  rGH  (Martial 
et al., 1979). These  studies  supported  the hypothesis that  the 
genes coding for  these  hormones originated  from a  common 
precursor  by  gene  duplication  and  that  the 
CS-GH  gene 
duplication  occurred at some  time after  the  separation of the 
human  and  rat species (Bewley et aZ.,  1972; Niall et al., 1971). 
Although  a  fragment of  DNA  complementary  to a portion of 
rPrl mRNA  has been  cloned  and sequenced  (Gubbins et  al., 
1979), the  complete  nucleotide  sequence of a  Prl  structural 
gene has been missing from these comparisons. 

Prolactin  (Prl),  growth  hormone (GH), and chorionic 
somatomammotropin (CS) form a set  (the ‘Trl set”) of 
mammalian  hormones which is  thought  to  have evolved 
from a common ancestral gene. Until now this  assump- 
tion  was  based  on  similarities  in 
their  amino  acid  se- 
quences, on  their  often  overlapping biological and im- 
munological properties,  and  on nucleic  acid  sequence 
data for  two  members  of  the  set  (GH  and CS).  In the 
current  study, we report  the amplification in bacteria 
and  the  sequence  analysis  of  DNA  complementary  to 
rat  Prl mRNA. Two independent clones were  obtained, 
one of which contained 823 bases  including the  entire 
sequence coding for rat prolactin  and  its signal  peptide 
and  parts of  the 5‘-  and 3”untranslated  regions  of  the 
mRNA.  The  nucleotide  sequences  of  the  two  cloned 
DNAs  differ  by  three  nucleotides.  In  addition,  both 
predicted  amino  acid  sequences  also  differ  by  about 
14%  from  the  published  amino  acid  sequence  of  the 
protein.  Although  technical  problems  cannot  be 
ex- 
cluded for  each of these  discrepancies, the  data  suggest 
possible 
a  revised  structure  for  the  protein  and  the 
existence of distinct nonallelic Prl genes. The results of 
this  study  have  allowed us to compare  the nucleotide 
sequences of the  structural  genes coding for  each of the 
hormones of the  Prl set.  The  codons for  rPrl mRNA do 
not show the  marked  preference  for GMP and CMP in 
the  third  position  observed  in 
and  hCS 
mRNAs.  rGH  and  rPrl mRNAs show 39% nucleic acid 
homology in the coding  portion,  but  little homology in 
the  untranslated  regions.  This  differs  from  the  compar- 
ison between hGH and hCS where  the  same  degree of 
homology (about  93%) was  found  in  both 
the  coding 
and  noncoding regions.  Ten per  cent  of the codons of 
rPrl  and rGH are identical, and 26% differ by only  one 
base.  Of  the  latter,  only  58%  result  in  amino  acid 
changes, which most  often are conservative.  These re- 
sults  strongly  support  the  hypothesis that  the  Prl  and 
GH  genes  derive from  a common precursor.  The  data 
allow  us  to  suggest  a  date  for  this 
gene  duplication 
event at around 380 million years ago. 

rGH,  hGH, 

A cloned Prl cDNA would be useful along  with the GH and 
CS cDNAs  for  studying  the  differential  expression  of  these 
related genes. Both  Prl  and GH genes are expressed predom- 
inantly  in  the  pituitary,  whereas  the  CS  gene  is  expressed 
predominantly in the placenta. The  Prl  and  GH genes are also 
expressed in several lines of  cultured  rat  pituitary  tumor cells 
(Dannies  and  Tashjian, 1973) which can be manipulated by a 
variety of agents to favor their differential  expression (Martin 
and  Tashjian, 1977; Vale et al., 1973). Thus, cloned cDNA to 
Prl  mRNA would be a useful probe for studying the molecular 
mechanism of this regulation.  In  addition, this  cDNA consti- 
tutes  the probe  needed  to isolate the genomic Prl sequences 
from  chromosomal DNA. 

We  report  here  the  cloning  in  bacteria  and  the  complete 
nucleotide  sequence  of  the  structural  gene  coding  for  rPrl. 
These  data enable us to propose  a revised amino acid  sequence 
for rPrl, including  its signal  peptide.  While the  data  demon- 
strate some homology between rPrl  and  rGH  supporting  the 
evolutionary  relatedness of the two genes, they also document 
major differences  in  the  structures  and  codon  choices.  The 
data  are  consistent  with  the possibility  that  Prl  is the most 
primitive  molecule  in  this  “Prl  set”  of  related  polypeptide 
hormones. 

The polypeptide  hormones  prolactin (Prl), growth hormone 
(GH),  and  chorionic  somatomammotropin  (CS) are  closely 
related (Catt et al., 1967;  Li et al., 1969; Shenvood, 1967; Niall 
et  al.,  1971). Their  amino  acid  sequence  homologies  range

EXPERIMENTAL  PROCEDURES 

Animals-Female  Sprague-Dawley  (Wistar)  rats  were  anesthe- 
tized  with  Equithesan  (pentobarbital  1%.  ethanol  11.5%. chloral hey- 
drate 456,  MgS04 2%. propylene  glycol 44%  in  sterile  water)  and  the 
medial  basal hypothalami  destroyed using a modified Halasz  knife as 
previously  described  (Cheung  and Weiner,  1976). At  the  same  time, 
40-mm silastic  capsules filled with  Ili~-estradiol were implanted  sub- 
cutaneously.  Twenty-three  days  later  the  animals 
were  killed  by 
decapitation,  the  pituitaries  removed,  and  trunk  blood  collected  for

to 1 x 10’  colonies/pg of supercoiled  plasmid  in the various  transfor- 
mations.  In  the fmt experiment  in which  the  DNA was  ligated  into 
the Hind111 site of pBR322, the clones  were screened for ampH kt’. 
Plasmid  DNA  was  isolated  from  the  positive  clones,  digested  with 
Hind111 (New  England  Biolabs),  analyzed  by  electrophoresis  on  1% 
agarose  gels and hybridization  (Southern, 1975) using  a [‘”PIcDNA  to 
the  rPrl-enriched  mRNA  as  probe  (see below). In  the second  experi- 
ment in which the cDNA was  inserted  into  the Pst  I site of  pBR322, 
amp’  tetR colonies  were  replica-plated 
onto  Whatman  540  paper 
(Grunstein  and  Hogness,  1975) and  screened  with  the  cDNA  probe 
described  above.  Plasmid  was  isolated  from 
the  positive  clones, 
cleaved  with Pst I and analyzed by agarose gel and  Southern  hybrid- 
ization  using the  nick-translated plasmid  containing the  rPrl486-base 
pair  insert. 

Hybridization Probes-cDNA  probes were prepared  in  100-pl re- 
actions  containing  60  mM  NaC1,  10 mM  dithiothreitol, 50 m~  Tris- 
HCI, pH 8.3, 6 m~  MgCI,,  1.5  pg  of  oligo(dT)r~.l+ 1.5 pg of  mHNA, 40 
units of reverse  transcriptase, 400 rnM  each  dATP,  dTTP,  dGTP,  and 
11 p~  [a-,’”P]dCTP  dried  under  N,.  Incubation  was  at 37°C  for  60 
min.  Reactions  were  stopped  with  addition  of  EDTA  to  10  mM 
followed by phenol  and chloroform  extraction  and  fractionation  over 
Sephadex  G-50  as  described  above.  The  ethanol-precipitated  void 
volume  peak  was taken  up  in 0.4 N NaOH, 5 mM  EDTA,  heated  to 
37°C for 60 min, and  then neutralized  with  HCI. Incorporation of 10” 
cpm/pg  of  DNA was obtained  routinely. 

Nick-translated  probes were prepared  as described (Maniatis el al., 

1975); 10‘ cpm/pg of  DNA were obtained  routinely. 

DNA  Gel  Electrophoresis-Electrophoresis  on 

4.5  to  10% poly- 
acrylamide  slab  gels  was  performed 
in  Tris/borate/EDTA  buffer 
(Peacock and  Dingman, 1967) at 30 mA/gel. Electrophoresis on  0.8 to 
2%  agarose  horizontal  gels  was  performed 
in  Tris/acetate/NaCI/ 
EDTA buffer  (Peacock  and  Dingman, 1968) at 50 V/gel. 

DNA Sequence Analysis-5”Ends  were  labeled  with polynucleo- 

tide  kinase  (Boehringer-Mannheim)  and  [y-’”PIATP  (Amersham, 
4200  Ci/mmol)  after  previous  dephosphorylation of  the  DNA  with 
alkaline  phosphatase  (Enzo  Biochemicals).  3’-Ends  were  labeled  by 
E. coli DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment  (Boehringer-Mannheim) 
and  the  appropriate [a-’”P]deoxynucleoside triphosphate. The chem- 
ical cleavage technique  (Maxam  and  Gilbert, 1977). with  one modifi- 
cation,’ was used  on DNA  restriction  fragments.  For chemical  modi- 
fication at  the adenine residues,  25 pl  of  formic acid  (Mallinckrodt) 
were added  to 10 p1  of  [”PIDNA  and  allowed  to  react for  10 min  at 
20°C. Reaction  was stopped with  addition of  200  pI of  0.3 M  sodium 
acetate, 0.1 mM  EDTA,  and 25 pg/ml  of  tRNA.  The  thin gel system 
was used  (Sanger  et  al., 1977). 

radioimmunoassay of  Prl.  Prl  concentrations  were  measured  using 
rabbit  antiserum  to  rPrl  provided  by  Dr. Albert  F. Parlow  through 
the  National  Institute of Arthritis,  Metabolism  and Digestive  Diseases 
rat  pituitary  hormone  distribution  program. 

Cultured  Pituitary Cells-GH, 

and  GC cells  were  grown  at 37°C 
in monolayer as previously  described (Martial  et al., 1977), in Ham F- 
10 and  MEM  Joklik  medium, respectively.  Both media  were  supple- 
mented with 15% horse  serum  and 2.5% fetal calf serum.  For  hormonal 
stimulation, GH, cells  received fresh medium containing  thyrotropin- 
releasing  hormone  (TRH,  30  nM,  Sigma)  and  estradiol 
(100  nM, 
Sigma) 48 h  prior to  harvest. Cells  were harvested with 0.058 tr.wsin 
and 0.02% EDTA. 

mRNA Preparation and Characterization-The 

frozen pituitaries 
or cell pellets were added  to a sterile  solution  containing 5 M guanidine 
thiocyanate,  50  mM  Tris-HCI,  pH  7.5,  2  mM  EDTA,  and  5% p- 
mercaptoethanol  (Chirgwin et  al., 1979). After homogenization  (Pol- 
ytron) of the  tissue,  N-lauryl  sarcosine was added  to 2%. CsCl to 0.35 
g/ml,  and  the  mixture  was  heated for  2  min  at 65°C. This  solution 
was  layered  over  a  cushion of  5.7 M CsCI, 1 mM EDTA,  and centrifuged 
in an SW 40 rotor at 32,000 rpm for 24 h at 20°C. The  resultant  pellets 
were  dissolved  in 10 mM  Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM  EDTA,  and  1% N- 
lauryl  sarcosine,  extracted with  phenol  and  chloroform  and precipi- 
tated  with  ethanol  in  the presence  of 0.3 M sodium  acetate. 

Polyadenylated  RNA was  isolated  by aftinity  chromatography  on 
a 
cell-free  system  in  the  presence  of  [:%]methionine 

oligo(dT) cellulose  (P-L Biochemicals,  type  7)  and  translated  in 
wheat  germ 
(Amersham, 600 to 1300 Ci/mmol) as previously reported  (Martial  et 
al.,  1977). Preprolactin  synthesized  in  the cell-free  system was  im- 
mune-precipitated  with  rabbit  antiserum  to  rPrl  and  the Cowan strain 
of  Staphylococcus  aureus as described  earlier  (Martial  et  al., 1977). 
”%-Proteins were  electrophoresed on  12.5% sodium  dodecyl  sulfate 
slab polyacrylamide  gels  (Laemmli, 1970) at 20  mA/gel.  Gels  were 
fmed in 50% trichloroacetic  acid  for 30 min, washed twice for  1  h  in 
7% acetic acid,  dried  on Whatman  No.  3MM  paper,  and  exposed  to 
X-ray film (Kodak,  NS2T). 

cDNA  Synthesis a n d  Construction  of  Recombinant  Plusmids- 

The cDNA  synthesis,  HindIII  linker ligation, and  recombinant plas- 
mid construction leading to  the cloning of the 486-base pair  fragment 
were as described  earlier  (Seeburg  et al., 1977), except  that  the first 
strand  cDNA  synthesis  was  for  75  min  and  endonuclease  HindIII 
(New  England Biolabs) rather  than Hsu I was used. 

For  cloning  the  full  length  rPrl  cDNA, 

21  pg  of  rPrl-enriched 
polyadenylated  RNA were  reverse  transcribed as above.  After  base 
hydrolysis of the  RNA,  phenol  and chloroform  extraction,  fractiona- 
tion  over  Sephadex  G-50, and  ethanol  precipitation,  the  ”H-labeled 
single-stranded  cDNA  (about  3 pg) was 2-dCMP-tailed  (Roychoud- 
hury  et  al.,  1976) in a  130-p1 reaction containing  140 mM  potassium 
cacodylate,  30 m~ Tris  base  (final pH 6.91,  100  p~  dithiothreitol,  1 
mM  CoC12, 50  p~  dCTP, 6.2  PM  [a-’”PIdCTP  (Amersham,  300 Ci/ 
mmol), and 28 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl  transferase  (Enzo 
Biochemicals). The reaction  was  incubated  at 37°C  for  24 min  and 
was monitored by incorporation of radioactivity  precipitated  on  DE81 
paper. The reaction  was stopped with phenol  and chloroform  extrac- 
tion  after  an  estimated 80 dCMPs were added,  then  fractionated on 
Sephadex  G-50  and  ethanol-precipitated.  Oligo(dG)le.lx (P-L Bio- 
chemicals)  was  used  to  prime  synthesis  of  the  second  strand  under 
conditions identical  with  the  first  strand  synthesis  except  that only 
cold  nucleoside  triphosphates  were  present.  Reaction  was  in  150 pl 
with 40 units of reverse transcriptase  from  avian myeloblastosis virus 
(Dr. J. W. Beard, Life Sciences, Inc.) for 90 min at 42OC. After  phenol 
and chloroform extraction,  Sephadex G-50 fractionation,  and  ethanol 
precipitation,  the  1.9 pg  of  double-stranded  cDNA  were  3”dCMP- 
tailed  in  50 p1  of 
the previously  described  buffer  with  500 pmol  of 
dCTP/S”end.  The reaction was terminated with  phenol  and chloro- 
form  extraction  after 15 dCMP residues had been  added  to  each  end 
as estimated  by incorporation  of label. The  reaction was fractionated 
on  Sephadex G-50 and  ethanol-precipitated with  1 pg of Torula  RNA 
used as carrier. 

Fifty  nanograms  of  dCMP-tailed,  double-stranded  cDNA 

were 
Pst  I  (New  England 
annealed  to  50  ng  of  pBR322  cleaved  with 
Biolabs), and tailed  with dGMPs (16 dGMPs/end) in 100p1 containing 
10 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7 4 1  m~ EDTA,  and 100 mM NaCI. The mixture 
was heated  to 80°C for  a  few minutes,  allowed  to cool gradually  to 
42”C,  incubated  overnight at 42OC, and  then cooled gradually to 4OC. 
Transformation and Colony Screening-Transformation  of Esch- 
erichia  coli x1776 with each of  the plasmid  preparations was carried 
out  as previously  described  (Seeburg et al., 1977) in accordance with 
National  Institutes of Health guidelines, The yield  ranged  from 0.15

Double-stranded cDNA  Synthesis  and Cloning-Rat  Prl 
cDNA  was synthesized and  cloned  in  two 
separate  experi- 
ments.  In  the fmt experiment, double-stranded  cDNA  was 
prepared  from  the  Prl-enriched  pituitary  polyadenylated 
RNA template using reverse transcriptase from avian myelo- 
blastosis virus (AMV) to synthesize both strands followed by 
S, nuclease  digestion of the resulting hairpin loop. Aliquots of 
this material digested  with  several restriction endonucleases 
generated  a series of  discrete  DNA  fragments separable  by 
polyacrylamide  gel  electrophoresis  (data  not  shown).  The 
presence of  prominent bands suggested that  this cDNA  was 
quite enriched in one or a few specific  DNA  species. The DNA 
complementary  to  rPrl  mRNA  was  expected to  be  among 
these species based  on the cell-free translation data. 

Chemically synthesized "P-labeled  double-stranded  DNA 
decamers containing the restriction site for Hind111 (5°C-C- 
A-A-G-C-T-T-G-G-3')  were then  ligated  to  each end  of  the 
double-stranded cDNA to  rat  pituitary  mRNA. After diges- 
tion of this product with HindIII  to remove the extra HindIII 
concatamers, the double-stranded cDNA  with a single HindIII 
cohesive terminus at each end was purified  on a preparative 
polyacrylamide gel. Double-stranded cDNA with a length of 
about 450 to  lo00  base pairs was electroeluted  from the gel 
and ligated into  the  HindIII  site of pBR322. This plasmid  was 
then used to transform E. coli strain x1776 as described under

Therefore,  the  synthesis of the second strand could be primed

ative fiter is displayed in  Fig.  3A. Of  these  25 recombinant 
plasmids, only one contained a cDNA insert  greater than 800 
base  pairs  in  length  (Fig. 3B,  the size  anticipated  for  full 
length  rPrl cDNA) which also hybridized with  the 486-base 
pair rPrl cDNA cloned in the first experiment (Fig. 3C). This 
insert was  823 base pairs in length and  had  a DNA sequence 
compatible with the one expected for rPrl cDNA. 
Nucleotide Sequence of  the Two Cloned rPrl cDNAs-The 

complete nucleotide sequences of  both the 486- and 823-base 
pair  cloned rPrl  cDNAs  were  det.ermjned by  the  chemical 
degradation method  (Maxam and Gilbert, 1977). Each cloned 
DNA  was sequenced two or more times, and in 75% of the full 
length  molecule both  the  message and  antimessage strands 
were sequenced. The 486-base pair cloned cDNA corresponds 
to  an  internal  fragment  of  the 823-base pair cloned  cDNA 
(from nucleotide 230 to 716). The double-stranded DNA se- 
quence of  the larger molecule and the location of  restriction 
endonuclease sites are shown in  Fig.  4. 

The  rPrl  mRNA  sequence  and  the  derived  amino  acid 

sequence are shown in  Fig. 5. If this assignment of amino acids 
is correct  and if translation begins with the methionine codon 
at  position  -28  as  indicated,  then  the  primary  translation 
product  of  rPrl  mRNA  is  a  protein  of  25,655.65  daltons. 
Preliminary  amino acid sequences for rPrl (Shome  and Par- 
low,  1977) and its NHderminal signal peptide  (McKean and 
Maurer, 1978) have been reported. Our predicted amino acid 
sequence agrees with  the published  sequences in  172 of  the 
197 amino acids  of  rPrl  and  in  27  of  28  amino  acids in  the 
signal peptide.  Our  sequence  does  not  contain  the  alanine 
residue  reported  at position  -20  of 
the signal peptide, sug- 
gesting that  the actual signal peptide contains 28 rather  than 
29 amino acids. Similarly, our  data indicate that  the  mature 
hormone contains 197 rather  than 198 amino acids as previ- 
ously reported, Of the remaining discrepancies, 15 are omis- 
sions or  additions,  9  are  differences in  the  reported  amino 
acid, and  4  result  from  two  inversions  of  two  amino  acids. 
Three of our changes convert the amino acid to the one found 
in  the  corresponding  position  in  hPrl  (Shome and  Parlow,

et  al., 1977). Destruction of  the medial  basal  hypothalamus 
increases  circulating  Prl concentrations while  inhibiting  the 
secretion of other  anterior  pituitary  hormones  (Bishop et al., 
1972). In  addition,  the  number of  mammotrophs  increases 3- 
fold  in  animals  with lesions.” Estrogen  treatment also stimu- 
lates  Prl  synthesis  (Lieberman et al.,  1978; Seo et  al.,  1979) 
and  causes  hypertrophy of mammotrophs  (Gersten  and  Baker, 
1970). In  the  present  study, combining these two treatments 
caused  a  greater  than  2-fold  increase  in  the weight  of  the 
anterior  pituitary  gland  (16 to 38 mg) and a 40-fold increase 
in serum  Prl  (30 to 1200 ng/ml).  Analysis  by cell-free  trans- 
lation of the  RNA isolated  from the  pituitaries of these  treated 
rats showed  that  the level  for  Prl  mRNA  was  substantially 
greater  than  that  seen in normal  rats  or in cultured  pituitary 
tumor cells (GHs cell line)  that were stimulated  with  estrogens 
and  thyrotropin-releasing  hormone.  This obviated  the need 
for further  mRNA purification and  thus  enabled  us  to  synthe- 
sue directly  cDNA  highly 
enriched  in  Prl  gene  sequences. 
Secondly,  for  synthesis  of  the  823-base  pair  fragment,  we 
devised  a  technique  to  prevent  the 
loss  of  DNA  sequences 
complementary  to  the 5’-end of  the mRNA.  This loss inevit- 
ably  occurs when S, nuclease is used to digest the  hairpin loop 
joining the two strands of DNA resulting from  the self-priming 
of  the second  strand  on  the  fist one.  In  this  technique,  an 
oligopolymeric tract of dCMPs was added to  the 3”end  of the 
single-stranded  cDNA.  This  tract was  used  as a template  to 
prime  the  synthesis 
strand  using  a 
commercial  oligo(dG)  primer.  Sequencing of the  final double- 
stranded cDNA molecule which had been dCMP-tailed again 
at both 3‘-ends, revealed  tracts of  14  and  16 dCMPs  at  each 
end,  not  the  predominance  of  dCMPs  on  the  5‘-end of  the 
message strand expected from  the initial  tailing of the single- 
stranded  DNA.  We 
deoxynucleotidyl  transferase was  contaminated  with  exonu- 
clease, and  this  may  have  caused loss of  the 3”poly(A)  tract 
and  adjacent  sequences  in  our cloned  molecule  (including the 
AAUAAA found in most  other  eukaryotic  mRNAs).  The loss 
was probably  minimal  based  on  estimates of  full length  rPrl 
mRNA as 840 f 40 bases  (Evans  and Rosenfeld, 1979). Despite 
in a longer 5”untranslated

time  of  the  fist and  second  strand  synthesis  with 
reverse 
transcriptase was extended from the usual 15 min (Seeburg et 
al., 1977; Shine et  al.,  1977) to 75 to 90 min. This was done 
after  control  experiments  with  our  enzyme  indicated  that 
[3’P]dCMP  continued  to  accumulate 
in  specific  restriction 
fragments of  the  product  for  up  to 90 min.  This  result  is in 
agreement with the  results of  Buell et al. (1978).

for amino acids  -16  to 145 previously  reported  (Gubbins  et 
al., 1979) have  nearly identical  nucleotide  sequences. The 486- 
base pair fragment differs from  the 823-base pair  fragment by 
only  three  nucleotides:  adenine  instead  of  cytosine  in  the 
second  base  of  the  codon  for  amino  acid  98  and  thymine 
instead of cytosine for  the  third base of  the  codons  for  amino 
acids  125 and  128. The  latter  two  differences  are silent,  but 
the  fist converts  asparagine  in  the  486-base  pair  clone  to 
threonine in the 823-base pair clone; both of these  amino acids 
are  members of the  same chemical  subfamily. Such  substitu- 
tions which  commonly  occur 
in  related  proteins  may  have 
little  effect on the  secondary  or  tertiary  structure  or  function 
of the  hormone (Dayhoff, 1978).

1977). A  cluster  of  18 discrepancies  occurs  between  amino 
acids 70  and  104, an  area  whose  amino  acid  sequence  was 
apparently  determined with chymotryptic digests (our conclu- 
sion by  analogy  with  the  strategy used  for  hPrl,  Shome  and 
Parlow,  1977). Since  proper  alignment  is often  difficult  with 
such digests,  the nucleic  acid sequence  may be more reliable 
in  this  case.  Also, shown  in  Fig.  5  are the nucleic  acid  and 
predicted  amino acid sequences for rGH  (Seeburg et al., 1977). 
The  amino  acid  sequence of  rGH  and  rPrl  were  aligned  by 
introducing  arbitrary  gaps in order  to maximize their  identity. 
Table I summarizes conclusions  based  on  this  comparison of 
the molecules. 

The codon  selection  in  rPrl  mRNA is nonrandom  (Fig. 6), 

as in rGH,  hGH,  and hCS.  However,  in contrast  to  these  other 
members of  the  Prl  set,  rPrl  has  no  preference  for  GMP  and 
CMP  over  AMP  and  UMP 
(Table 11).

DISCUSSION 

In  the  studies  reported  here,  analysis 

of two  different cloned 
DNA  fragments  containing  structural  rPrl  gene  sequences is 
presented. One of  the  fragments,  containing 486 base  pairs, 
was inserted  into  a  plasmid  after  addition  of  Hind111 linker 
DNA  to  blunt-ended  double-stranded  cDNA. The  other frag- 
ment which  contains  almost all of  the bases  complementary 
to  rPrl  mRNA  was  inserted  into  a  plasmid  with 
the use  of 
dGMP-dCMP  tailing.  The  nucleotide  sequence  of  these 
DNAs,  although generally  agreeing  with  that expected  from 
the  amino acid sequence  data  (Shome  and Parlow,  1977), has 
enabled  us  to propose  a substantial revision in the  preprolactin 
sequence.  The nucleic  acid  sequence was  also  compared  to 
that  previously  determined  for  rGH  (Seeburg  et  al.,  1977) 
revealing  certain  interesting  differences  in  base  composition 
and codon  selection.

Likewise, comparison of  the full length clone  with the 387- 
base pair  sequence of Gubbins et al. (1979), reveals differences 
in three nucleotides. These are: CTT (leucine)  instead of CTC 
(leucine), ATT (isoleucine) instead of ATC  (isoleucine), and 
AGC  (serine)  instead  of  GGC  (glycine) at  amino  acids  125, 
128, and 133, respectively.  Among these differences, which all 
represent a single nucleotide change  per codon, two  are silent. 
The  third  one  leads  to a serine  to glycine change which  is a 
commonly  observed  substitution  and  which  may  not  affect 
biological function  significantly  (Dayhoff,  1978). The  change 
in our  sequence at amino acid 133 results in the  addition of a 
second  Hue  I11  site  five  bases  in 
the 5‘  direction  from  the 
single  Hue  I11  site  previously  reported.  This  change 
also 
results in the  addition of  an Eco RII  site which is confwmed 
by  restriction enzyme  analysis.  Our  rPrl  mRNA  came  from 
Sprague-Dawley  rats while  the  RNA  of  Gubbins et  al. was

differences  may  represent 
allelic polymorphism  in the  Prl molecule as  has been  observed 
in bovine GH (Fellows and Rogol,  1969), or  the cloned mole- 
cules  may  represent  transcripts  from nonallelic  genes  as has 
been  shown for rat preproinsulin  (Ullrich  et al., 1977). Errors 
in reverse transcription  (Gopinathan et al., 1979) or  sequenc- 
ing cannot be excluded. Of interest in this  regard,  two-dimen- 
sional gels of  rPrl  mRNA  translation  products  have revealed 
two molecular  forms of  rPrl  (Evans et al., 1978) and  hybridi- 
zation  with rPrl cDNA to  the genomic DNA of GH,  cells has 
given a  calculated  gene copy number of  2.4 per haploid  genome 
(Evans  and Rosenfeld, 1979). Whether  the  various  rPrl  cDNA 
molecules  will  be assigned to  one  or  more  chromosomal loci 
will  depend upon  the isolation,  cloning  and  characterization 
of  all genomic Prl sequences from the  normal  rat.

Comparison  of  rPrl  and  rGH-When 

the  amino acid  se- 
quences of  rPrl  and  rGH  (Seeburg  et  al., 1977) are aligned 
with  arbitrary  gaps  to  maximize  their  identity,‘  51  of  209 
amino  acid  residues  are  identical  (Table  I)  and  118 more 
represent common substitutions of related residues  (Dayhoff, 
1978). This  degree of  identity  and  the prevalence  of conserv- 
ative differences  suggest  that  the  genes  coding  for 
the two 
hormones  arose by duplication of a  common ancestor (Bewley 
et  al.,  1972; Niall et al, 1971). Since  the  pituitaries of  birds, 
reptiles, and  amphibians all contain  distinct Prl-like and  GH- 
like  molecules,  the  Prl-GH  gene  duplication  has  been  esti- 
mated  to  have  occurred  before 
the  divergence  of  fish  and 
tetrapods, 300 to 400 million years ago  (Acher, 1976). Another 
estimate of  this  time of  divergence can be made by applying 
the “evolutionary  clock” hypothesis.  This  assumes  that  neu- 
tral changes accumulate in a given protein at a constant  rate 
expressed as unit evolutionary  period.  One unit  evolutionary 
in  millions  of  years  for  a  1% 
period  is  the  average  time 
difference  in  amino acid  sequence  to  arise between  lineages; 
for Prl, the  unit evolutionary  period is 5  (Wilson et al., 1977a). 
From  the 76% difference  between  rPrl  and  rGH (Fig. 51,  the 
Prl-GH divergence time is estimated  to  have occurred  about 
380 million years ago, in good agreement with the taxonomic 
estimate.  This significantly predates  the divergence time  that 
we  calculate  for hGH  and  hCS at 56 million years ago, using 
the  GH  unit  evolutionary  period  of 4  (Wilson  et  al., 19774 
and homology data  from  Martial et al. (1979). 

Using the  same  alignment (Fig. 5), direct  comparison of the 
nucleic  acid  sequences  indicate a 39% incidence  of  identical 
nucleotides.  As  previously  noted  when  comparing  hGH  to 
rGH  and  hCS  (Martial et al.,  1979), the nucleotide  homology 
is  greater  than  the  amino acid  homology. The drift of  silent 
and presumably  neutral  mutations in  the  comparison of  the 
two sequences  reveals  that 24  of  52 single nucleotide  changes

random  basis,  one would  expect  a rate  of  only 25%. Similar 
high  rates  of  silent  mutations  have  been  reported  between 
homologous  nucleotide  sequences from  different  organisms 
(Jukes  and King,  1979). Such high  rates of  silent  mutations 
may reflect evolutionary  pressure  to conserve certain  impor- 
tant  structural  elements  and  further  support  the 
common 
precursor  hypothesis previously  derived from  amino acid se- 
quence  data. 

Our  cloned  DNA  contains  52 base  pairs corresponding  to 
the  5’-untranslated  region  of  rPrl  mRNA.  The  number 
of 
nucleotides  still missing  from  the  complete  structure  is  un- 
known.  There is  no  striking  homology  with  rGH  mRNA 
in 
this region, and only  limited complementarity  with  the 3’-end 
of  eukaryotic ribosomal  RNA  (Hagenbuchle  et al.,  1978). In 
the  5“untranslated  region  of  rPrl,  the  sequence  GUGGU  is 
repeated  three  times beginning 47, 18, and 9  nucleotides from 
the AUG  initiation codon.  GUGG  is repeated  twice  in  rGH 
mRNA, 19 and 2  nucleotides  from AUG, once in hGH  mRNA, 
19 nucleotides from AUG, and  once in hCS  mRNA, 5’ nucleo- 
tides from AUG.‘  GUGG  is absent  from  the  5”untranslated 
region of  mRNAs for  ovalbumin  (McReynolds,  1978), human 
a-chorionic gonadotropin  (Fiddes  and Goodman, 2979), bovine 
corticotropin-j3-lipotropin (bACTH-LPH  Nakanishi  et  al., 
1979), bovine preproparathyroid  hormone  (Kronenberg et al., 
1979), and  rat preproinsulin  I and I1 (Lomedico et al., 1979). 
Fig. 7  shows  a possible secondary  structure  for  this region of 
the  rPrl  mRNA  which  leaves  the  GUGGU  unpaired  in  a 
hairpin loop. It is not known whether  the preservation  of this 
structure  at a fixed distance from the  initiation codon in these 
three  related  polypeptide  hormones is significant. The  short 
palindrome  (5’-UUCUCUU-3’) in  the 5”untranslated  region 
of  rPrl  mRNA is not  present in rGH  mRNA,  but less of the 
5”untranslated  sequence of the  latter is known. 

The  3“untranslated regions of rPrl  and  rGH  mRNAs  do  not 

show significant homology. In  this  area,  rPrl lacks the regions 
rich  in  guanine and cytosine  which are  present  in  rGH,  hGH, 
and  hCS,  and  has  a  guanine  and  cytosine  content 
of  36%, 
similar  to  the  42%  of 
total  rat  DNA  (Sueoka,  1961). The 
sequence 5’-UUCUUAAAAGUCUAUUUCUU-3’ located  in 
region  of  rPrl  may  correspond  to  the 
the  3”untranslated

unknown.

regions. Human  CS  and  hGH which, as discussed  above, may 
have  diverged  56  million  years ago,  have 93% homology  in 
both  coding  and  noncoding  regions;  hGH  and  rGH  which 
diverged about  132 million years ago have 75% homology  in 
the coding  region, 73% in the 5'- and 38% in the 3"noncoding 
regions (Martial et al., 1979); and  rPrl  and  rGH which  diverged 
380 million years ago have 39% homology  in the coding  regions 
and  about  30%'j in  the  noncoding  regions.  These  data  are 
consistent  with  the  hypothesis of  Nishioka  and  Leder (1979), 
that  two  modes  of  nucleotide  sequence  evolution  can  be 
distinguished, a slow mode  preserving sequence homology and 
a  faster  mode  in  areas where  there  are no  RNA  or protein 
sequence  constraints. 

Codon  usage  in  rPrl  is  nonrandom,  as  has  been  found in 
other  eukaryotic  mRNAs.  No  consistent  pattern  has 
emerged 
(Martial et  al.,  1979), although  one  striking  difference  has 
been  observed  within  the  Prl set. In total rat DNA as in all 
vertebrate DNA, guanine  and  cytosine  constitute 42%  of  the 
residues  (Sueoka, 1961). However,  in the  third position of the 
codons  for  rGH,  hGH,  and  hCS  there  is a strong  preference 
for  guanine  and  cytosine 
(74%, 76%, and  80%, respectively, 
Table 11)  whereas in  rPrl  the  third  codon  choice  is random 
(5056, Table It). Table I t  summarizes  the usage of guanine  and 
cytosine  in the  third position of the codons  for several  mRNAs 
of  eukaryotic  hormones. Only bovine  preproparathyroid  hor- 
mone  mRNA  has  a  lower  guanine plus cytosine  percentage 
than  rPrl  mRNA  (Kronenberg et al., 1979). The  guanine plus 
cytosine preference  is  more  marked in those  hormones of  the 
Prl  set  thought  to  be  of  more  recent  origin;  however,  the 
extent  to  which  this  trend  is  generalized  and  significant  is 
unknown. 

With  the  results of the  current  study, coding sequence  data 
for at least  one  gene  from  each of  the  entire  Prl set is now 
available,  and  there  is  clear  evidence 
for  the  evolutionary 
relatedness  of  Prl,  GH,  and  CS.  Although  nucleic  acid 
quence  data  for all three hormone genes from  one  species  are 
not  yet  available,  the  rPrl  and  rGH  genes  are  clearly  much 
more different than  are  the  hGH  and  hCS genes. The biolog- 
ical activities of  these  hormones  show  considerable  interspe- 
cies  variation.  Thus,  it  will be of  interest  to  apply  the  same 
analysis  to  this  set  of  hormones  in  a  variety  of  species  to 
determine  the  extent of intra-  and  interspecies similarities  in 
these genes.
