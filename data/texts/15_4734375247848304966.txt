Cost Analysis of Alternative Harvest and Storage Methods for Switchgrass in the Southeastern U.S. Abstract
This study evaluated the potential impacts of dry matter losses from alternative harvest and storage methods on the costs of growing switchgrass for energy production. Data from a switchgrass bale harvest and storage experiment at Milan, TN, indicate that storage losses for covered rectangular bales were greater than for covered round bales. In addition, the cost of delivered feedstock increased with longer storage times because of larger dry matter losses. Even though storage losses were higher with uncovered large round bales, production costs were the lowest because costs of storage were minimal compared to other storage methods.

Cost Analysis of Alternative Harvest and Storage Methods for Switchgrass in the Southeastern U.S.
Introduction This research evaluated the tradeoffs in the costs of large round and rectangular bales of
switchgrass delivered to a biorefinery for processing into ethanol considering dry matter losses during storage for alternative storage methods. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 mandates a minimum of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel production in the US by 2022 (U.S. Congress, 2007). To meet the aforementioned renewable fuels production goals, lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) from dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass, agricultural residues, forest resources, and other bi-products will need to be produced on a cost competitive basis with fossil fuel sources (De La Torre et al., 2007). It has been has estimated that up to 10% of agricultural land in the US could be converted to dedicated energy crop production (De La Torre Ugarte et al., 2007; Perlack et al., 2005).
Notwithstanding the potential for dedicated energy crop production, substantial technical barriers related to the production, harvest, storage, and logistics of LCB feedstocks have yet to be overcome. As part of the national effort to overcome these barriers, the U.S. Department of Energy has a goal for its research and development efforts to make ethanol from LCB sources cost competitive with petroleum by 2012 (U.S. Department of Energy, 2008). The development of a LCB feedstock supply chain will need to be regionally appropriate and one that can use offthe-shelf technologies to meet the 2012 cost goal. For example, switchgrass can be harvested using conventional hay equipment that many farmers already have at their disposal (Jensen et al., 2007). In addition, the LCB feedstock supply chain system will need to be flexible enough to incorporate new technologies as they become available, meet the feedstock quality and cost needs of biorefineries, and provide sufficient profits to feedstock suppliers to induce production.
1

Switchgrass, a warm season perennial grass native to the United States, is widely recognized as a potential leading crop for dedicated energy production (McLaughlin and Kszos, 2005). The projected time for the harvest of switchgrass is once in the fall or winter after a killing freeze (Rinehart, 2006). After a freeze, nutrients move into the root system, minimizing the harvest of nutrients and their replacement, and maximizing the harvestable LCB for conversion to ethanol. Thus, a single, late-season harvest may be a key factor in making switchgrass production a sustainable low input system. However, switchgrass is a bulky material relative to the energy contained, so it is relatively expensive to harvest, store, and transport and thus are essential determinants of the cost of ethanol derived from switchgrass. Researchers have evaluated different aspects of the feasibility and costs of harvesting, storing, and transporting LCB feedstock using currently available harvest technologies but have not evaluated the impact of dry matter losses for different storage periods and storage methods on the costs of producing switchgrass (e.g., Thorsell et al.,2004; Bransby et al., 2005; 2006; Mapemba et al., 2007; Kumar and Sokhansanj, 2007; Popp and Hogan, 2007; Perrin et al., 2008).
Two currently available harvest technologies, large round balers and large rectangular balers, may have certain advantages and disadvantages in a potential switchgrass feedstock supply chain. Large rectangular balers may have an economies of size advantage over large round bales because of the greater potential throughput per hour even though a large rectangular baler has an initial investment cost more than three times that of a large round baler (Thorsell et al.,2004; English, Larson and Mooney, 2008). Adding to the cost advantage of large rectangular balers is the estimated longer useful life relative to a large round baler (ASAE, 2000). There also may be cost advantages with the handling, storage, and transportation of large rectangular bales because more tonnage can be placed within a given area (English, Larson and Mooney, 2008).
2

However, dry matter losses from precipitation and weathering during storage may substantially diminish the quality and increase the costs of feedstock delivered to the biorefinery (Wiselogel et al. 1996; Sanderson et al. 1997). Large round bales are designed to shed water and may have an advantage over large rectangular bales (Cundiff and Grisso, 2008). This may be particularly true in Tennessee and the southeastern US where precipitation tends to be higher year-round relative to other regions and the available daylight hours for drying and harvest are less during the late fall and winter harvest period. Johnson et al. (1991) found a total handling and storage dry matter loss of 13% for switchgrass bales wrapped with twine and stored six months on sod in Indiana. Johnson et al. (1991) also found that storage/handling loss for net-wrapped bales on crushed rock was less at 5%. Wiselogel et al. (1996) and Sanderson et al (1997) also reported storage dry matter losses of 13% for round bales in Texas.
Notwithstanding the storage dry matter loss estimates for large round bales from these studies, information is lacking on storage losses over time for switchgrass harvested using either large round or large rectangular bale technology and stored using various methods. Thus, the objective of this research is to evaluate the impacts of dry matter losses from storing large round and large rectangular bales on the costs of switchgrass feedstock for ethanol production. Conceptual Framework
Epplin et al. (2007) have suggested that the development of a LCB-to-ethanol industry may follow one of two paths. One possible direction is a vertically integrated system where the bio-refinery leases (or purchases) lands and directly manages the production, harvest, storage, and transportation of feedstock. Another alternative for the processing plant is to enter into longterm production and harvest contracts with individual local farmers. Under this market scenario, the processor will likely have an interest in providing production contracts or other incentives to
3

induce farmers to supply sufficient feedstock to keep the plant operating at capacity. This

analysis assumes that the biorefinery contracts with individual farmers to produce and store

switchgrass. Thus, farmers are assumed to be price takers for inputs purchased and outputs sold

and the objective is to minimize production costs to maximize profits.

The anticipated capital requirement for a first-generation lignocellulosic refinery of a

given capacity is expected to be substantially greater than for an equivalent capacity corn ethanol

plant (Port, 2005). Given the substantial startup costs of an LCB refinery, investors and bankers

will want longer term contracts in place that assure stability of feedstock supply which represents

about half of the anticipated operating expenses of the plant (Anonymous, 2009). However, the

length of the contract will likely be shorter than for other energy companies and in the range of

five to seven years because of constraints on capital availability for LCB refinery startups

(Anonymous, 2009). Thus, the assumed contract length for determining switchgrass yields and

production costs was five years.

For this analysis, it is assumed that currently available hay equipment is used to establish,

maintain, harvest, stage, and store switchgrass on the farm before it is transported to the

processing plant. Costs of production ($/dry ton [dry ton]) include opportunity cost on land;

establishment costs incurred in the first year of production; and recurring annual costs for

nutrients, pest control, harvest, storage, and transportation to the biorefinery. Following Wang

(2009), these costs can be modeled using:

Pre-harvest costs ($/acre):

 = LAND + EST + AMC,

h = MOWh + RAKEh + BALEh ( y) + STAGEh ( y),

where h is bale type (round or rectangular); s is storage method; t is time in storage (days); LAND is land rental rate ($/acre); EST is switchgrass establishment cost amortized over the life of a contract to produce switchgrass ($/acre); AMC is annual maintenance cost which includes costs of fertilization and pest control ($/acre); y is switchgrass yield (dt/acre);MOW, RAKE, BALE, and STAGE are the labor, operating, and ownership costs of mowing, raking, baling, and handling of switchgrass before storage ($/dt), respectively;  is the dry matter loss during harvest; v is the dry matter loss during storage; w is dry matter loss during transportation;  is pre-harvest cost ($/dt);  is harvest cost ($/dt);  is storage cost ($/dt);  is transport cost to the biorefinery ($/dt); p is loss adjusted post harvest cost ($/dt); p is loss adjusted post storage cost ($/dt); and p is loss adjusted post transport cost to the biorefinery ($/dt) . Data and Methods Storage Dry Matter Losses
Dry matter loss data used in this research were from a switchgrass harvest and storage study at the Milan Research and Education Center (MREC) in Milan, Tennessee (English Larson, and Mooney, 2008). The three treatments in the study were: bale harvest method, bale storage method and bale storage time. Large round bales (5 ft ×4 ft) and large rectangular bales (4 ft × 8 ft) were the two bale harvest treatments. Bale storage treatments in the experiment

5

including covering or not covering the round and rectangular bales with a protective tarp on one

of three storage surfaces: 1) well-drained ground, 2) a gravel surface, or 3) a wooden pallet. For

the large round bales, the six storage treatments were: 1) uncovered on well-drained ground 2)

uncovered on gravel, 3) uncovered on wooden pallets, 4) covered on well-drained ground, 5)

covered on gravel, and 6) and covered on wooden pallets. For the rectangular bales, the four

storage treatments were: 1) uncovered on gravel, 2) uncovered on wooden pallets, 3) covered on

gravel, and 4) and covered on wooden pallets. The five target bale storage times in the

experiment were: 1) 100 days, 2) 200 days, 3) 300 days, 4) 400 days, and 5) 500 days.

Switchgrass bales for each treatment were obtained from plots at the MREC and from

farmer fields under contract with the University of Tennessee Switchgrass Project in Henry

County, TN. The twine wrapped bales were placed into the storage experiment on January 24-25,

2008. Each bale harvest method, storage method and storage time treatment was replicated three

times. The bales were randomly selected and placed into a treatment. The 108 large round bales

and the 78 large rectangular bales were weighed and sampled to determine dry matter as they

were placed into storage. At each storage time interval, three bales representing a particular

treatment were selected at random, weighed, mechanically separated in two halves,

photographed and proportionally sampled based on a visual estimate of up to four weathered

areas in each bale. The "wet sample weight" and "dry sample weight" were taken from weighing

the wet samples at each storage interval and later weighing the same samples after drying them.

The photograph of each bale sampled was imported into ArcGIS 9 and used to calculate the

proportion of the bale in each weathered area. The formula used to calculate the dry weight per

bale after each storage period (DWBhst) is given by:

DWB WWB  DSW= WA WSWhst

where WWB is the wet weight of the bale before sampling, WA is the proportion of the bale in

weathered area n, DSW is the dry sample weight, and WSW is the wet sample weight. The dry

weight per bale after harvest (DWBhs0) can be viewed as the dry weight per bale after 0 days of

storage. The storage dry matter loss (v) was obtained by dividing the difference between dry

weight after harvest and dry weight after storage by the dry weight after harvest, which is shown

in the following equation:

vhst

=

DWBhs0 - DWBhst DWBhs0

.

Storage Dry Matter Loss Response Function Estimation

(7)

Preliminary analysis of the switchgrass storage data suggested that the storage dry matter

losses tended to increase at a decreasing rate with time and cumulative precipitation. This

observation is consistent with Savoie et al. (2006) who indicated that dry matter losses for stored

biomass materials diminish over time and eventually stop at some point when no organic matter

is left to oxidize. In addition, the storage losses for each bale type were primarily influenced by

whether the bales were covered with a tarp or were left uncovered.

Given these observations, a quadratic-plus-plateau functional form and a Mitscherlich-

Baule functional form were used to estimate storage dry matter losses as a function of time (days

in storage) for each bale type (round or rectangular) and storage cover (tarp or no tarp). The

quadratic-plus-plateau and Mitscherlich-Baule functional forms imposed diminishing dry matter

losses as a function of time and an asymptotic dry matter loss plateau. Thus, the two functional

forms are consistent with the notion that the losses will stop at some point when no organic

matter is left to oxidize. Given that dry matter losses for each bale type and storage method were

7

assumed to be zero when bales were placed in storage, the two dry matter loss models were estimated without an intercept.
The quadratic-plus-plateau dry matter loss function as expressed in equation (8) is: (8)
where v is storage dry matter loss for bale type h, storage method s, and time in storage t (days); 1 and 2 are parameters to be estimated by regression; and t c and v p are the critical t and
plateau v, respectively. The Mitscherlich-Baule dry matter loss function as expressed in equation (10) is:
(9)
The parameter is comparable to in the quadratic-plus-plateau storage dry matter loss function representing an asymptotic plateau.
Models were estimated using the NLIN procedure in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, 2002). The NLIN procedure fits nonlinear regression models and determines parameter estimates by nonlinear least squares using an iterative convergence algorithm (SAS Institute, 2002). Starting values for the quadratic plateau model were obtained by first specifying a quadratic model and obtaining parameter estimates via OLS. For the Mitscherlich-Baule model starting values were obtained as suggested by Schabenberger and Pierce (2002). Convergence criteria were met for all models and treatments using the Newton convergence algorithm. Enterprise Budgeting
The yield assumptions and budgets for the equipment, materials, and labor used for the establishment, annual maintenance, harvest, storage and transportation of switchgrass were from budgets produced by The University of Tennessee Department of Agricultural and Resource
8

Economics (Gerloff, 2008; Mooney et al., 2008; English Larson, and Mooney, 2008; Wang, 2009). An average harvested yield of six dt/acre was used to calculate the cost per ton of producing switchgrass. The costs estimated for each budget were made in accordance with the American Agricultural Economics Association Cost and Return Handbook (AAEA 2000) and American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) Standards (2000). Labor time was assumed to be 1.25 times the corresponding machine time (ASAE Standards, 2000) and the wage for each operation was assumed to be $8.50/hour (Gerloff, 2008). The opportunity cost on land used for switchgrass production was $20/acre, the pasture land rental rate reported from 2007 by the Tennessee Agricultural Statistics Service (Tennessee Agriculture 2008).
Pre-harvest cost (). Establishment costs were amortized over an assumed contract period of five years and treated as an annualized cost. Annual maintenance cost included costs of nitrogen fertilizer and pesticides primarily for weed control. Nitrogen fertilization was assumed at the Extension recommended level of 60 lb nitrogen/acre. University of Tennessee Extension only recommends that phosphorous and potassium be applied on deficient soils and thus it was assumed that none was used in calculating costs.
Harvest cost (h.). The equipment assumed for the round bale harvest included a 5 ft × 4 ft large round baler, a mower, a rake, and a loader and a tractor. The rectangular bale harvest used a 4 ft × 8 ft rectangular baler in place of the round baler. After harvest, switchgrass bales were assumed to be transported by a tractor with a loader to the field edge for storage before being shipped to the biorefinery. The cost of equipment per acre is the product of corresponding cost per hour obtained from enterprise budgeting and machine time of the equipment. The total harvest cost per acre is the sum of the per acre costs of mowing, raking, baling and staging. Machine time of the balers were assumed to be linearly related to yield based on a throughput
9

capacity of 5.5 and 12 dts per hour, respectively, for the large round and large rectangular balers (English Larson and Mooney, 2008;Mooney et al. 2008). The machine times for mowing and raking were assumed not to vary with yield. Dry matter losses we assume to be the same for both bale harvest methods.
Storage cost (hst). The estimated costs for materials used for the storage of switchgrass bales including the sizes and prices for plastic tarps, gravel, and wooden pallets which were obtained from an informal survey from suppliers in Tennessee (Wang, 2009). Collins et al. (1997) found that the 3-2-1 pyramid design with three bales in the bottom, two in the middle and one on the top is practical and effective to shed water in the high precipitation environment found in Tennessee and the southeast United States. A 25 ft by 54 ft tarp was the assumed size used to cover both round and rectangular bales. Given the round bale size of 5 ft by 4 ft and the rectangular bale size of 4 ft by 8 ft, up to seventy-two round bales or sixty rectangular bales can be stored under one such tarp. A gravel pad with a 5-inch depth was assumed as a base for placing bales. Thus, one ton of gravel was assumed to cover 32 sq ft on the ground and an average of three round bales or 2.5 rectangular bales can be placed in that area when a 3-2-1 pyramid is assumed. Three pallets were assumed for six round bales placed in one row of the 32-1 pyramid design. Four pallets were assumed needed for one row with five rectangular bales. Given the expected contract period of five years, the tarps, gravel and pallets were assumed to have five years of useful life. Thus, the costs of tarps, gravel and pallets were amortized over five years and assumed to have zero salvage value. Wooden pallets were assumed to be replaced at a rate of 20 percent per year. Tarps and gravel pads were assumed to have a replacement rate of five percent of initial cost for each year of use. The storage cost per ton (sh) is sum of costs of the top cover, the bottom support, labor and pickup truck.
10

Transportation cost (hst). The cost of the semi-tractor trailer was obtained using the same budget procedures as used for harvest. Assuming a draw area of 50 miles in a circle surrounding a biorefinery, the average distance traveled from the farm to the plant was assumed to be 37.5 miles. The average travel speed of the semi-tractor trailer was assumed to be 50 miles/hour (Brechbill, Tyner, and Ileleji 2008). As a result, the time per round trip to the plant was assumed to be two hours. The capacity of the trailer was assumed to be 36 large round bales or 24 rectangular bales. Thus, the trailer carried 13 round bales or 6.5 rectangular bales per hour. The average bale density was assumed to be 0.4 dt/bale for the round bales and one dt/bale for the rectangular bales, so on average the trailer carried 13 tons of round bales per hour or 16 tons of rectangular bales per hour. Finally, the cost per ton of transportation (hst0) was obtained by dividing the cost per hour by tons per hour the trailer carries. Dry matter loss during transportation was assumed to be two percent for both bale types (Kumar and Sokhansanj 2007). Results and Discussion Storage Dry Matter Losses
Preliminary estimates of dry matter loss during storage are reported in Table 1. In general, estimated regression coefficients for the quadratic plateau model are statistically significant at conventional probability levels, with the exception of the squared term for both the round and square covered bale treatments. Sum of squared errors (SSE) and Pseudo R2 values are high and show little discrepancy between models for similar treatments. Estimated dry matter loss plateaus (vP in the quadratic plateau model, w1 in the Mitscherlich-Baule model) are also comparable for similar treatments across models. However, the plateau was estimated to occur outside of the range of data collected (>500 days) for both round bale treatments. While it may appear counterintuitive for the dry matter loss plateau for the round covered bale to exceed that
11

for the round uncovered bale, predicted dry matter loss estimates were lower for the range of data collected (>500).
Both functional forms provided similar dry matter loss estimates after 360 days in storage. For round bales, the estimated dry matter loss for a covered bale was about 9% compared to about 13% for an uncovered bale. By comparison, the estimated dry matter loss for a covered rectangular bale was about 30% after 360 days in storage. These results indicate that storage loss for a covered rectangular bale was greater than for a covered round bale. The estimated dry matter loss for an uncovered rectangular bale after 360 days in storage was much larger at about 46%. The uncovered rectangular bales in the Milan switchgrass bale storage experiment were often water logged and very difficult to handle without the twine breaking and the bale falling apart (English Larson, and Mooney, 2008). Thus, the use of uncovered rectangular bales was found to likely be impractical from a handling standpoint and thus must be covered.
Results also indicate that the dry matter losses increased at a decreasing rate with time as hypothesized (Figure 1). While not directly evaluated in this analysis, the primary factor influencing the rise in storage dry matter losses with time in the experiment was cumulative precipitation, which was consistent with the findings of Sanderson et al. (1997). The largest differences between the two models was observed in the first 300 days where the MitscherlichBaule function suggests dry matter losses occur more rapidly than for the quadratic plateau model (Figure 1). While such a visual comparison does not provide insight into the degree of statistical difference between these two models, further analysis will require a formal treatment of such differences.
12

Cost of Production Adjusted for storage Losses Consistent with Thorsell et al. (2004), the estimated cost per ton of switchgrass was less
with the large rectangular bale harvest system than with the large round bale system if storage dry matter losses were not considered. The cost of producing switchgrass using rectangular bale technology was estimated to be $50.66/dt if it was delivered to the biorefinery for processing immediately after harvest (Table 2). By comparison, the cost of producing switchgrass using the round bale technology was 14% ($7.16/dt) higher (Table 2. Thus, with conventional hay technology, the least cost method of producing switchgrass that would be processed into ethanol immediately after harvest was the rectangular bale system. In addition, more tonnage could be harvested in a limited harvest window with the rectangular baler than with the round baler. Assuming a four month harvest season (November through February) with a total of 53 field days (325 field hours) available considering weather (Larson and English, 2009), one rectangular baler could harvest 651 acres (3,903 dt) of switchgrass compared with 298 acres (1,789 dt) for the round baler.
As indicated previously, storage dry matter losses increased at a decreasing rate with time and cumulative precipitation as hypothesized (Figure 1). As a result, losses during storage increased the cost of feedstock with longer storage times (Table 2). Choice of storage method also had a substantial impact on the cost of switchgrass. Results indicate that the gravel storage pad with or without a tarp cover was not feasible because of the high initial cost to install the pad and the short five year contract period over which to recover the costs of the pad (Table 2). A key assumption of this analysis was that a farmer would want to fully recover the costs of storage within the prescribed contract period. A longer switchgrass production contract period may make the gravel pad storage option more cost competitive. Results indicate that storing switchgrass on
13

the lower cost pallet with the tarp cover option also was not cost effective except for a limited period after placement into storage under the quadratic plateau dry matter loss assumption (Table 2). Thus, the least cost method of producing switchgrass under Tennessee storage conditions was to harvest the switchgrass using a round baler and storing the bales without any protection. The costs of storage (equipment, materials, and labor) were greater than the value of the dry matter saved using storage. The round bales modeled in this study assumed twine wrapped bales. Round bales wrapped with mesh appear to have a more uniform shape that may facilitate handling and storage and may have lower storage losses (Johnson et al., 1991). Thus, the potential cost advantage of uncovered round bales relative to other bale type and storage methods may be greater with mesh wrapped bales. Summary and Conclusions
This study analyzed the potential impacts of storage dry matter losses for large round bale and large rectangular bale systems on the costs of growing switchgrass for energy production. Data from a switchgrass bale harvest and storage experiment at Milan, TN, indicate that storage losses for covered rectangular bales were greater than for covered round bales. In addition, the cost of delivered feedstock increased with longer storage times because of larger dry matter losses. Even though storage dry matter losses were higher with uncovered large round bales, delivered costs were lower because costs of storage were minimal compared to other storage methods. However, the rectangular bale system had the lowest cost of production after harvest and before being placed into storage.
Assuming that a biorefinery could process more than one bale type, a mixture of bale types may minimize the cost of switchgrass feedstock. Given the lower cost rectangular bales before being put into storage, a biorefinery might want to have switchgrass harvested using
14

rectangular balers and transported to the plant immediately for processing during the harvest
period. The biorefinery would then use round bales stored without protection for the rest of the
year as a feedstock in the production of ethanol.
The first important caveat for this analysis is that the potential yield of ethanol per ton dry
matter is the same regardless of storage method. Switchgrass dry matter that is not protected
from weathering may potentially reduce the yield of ethanol. The second important limitation of
this study is related to the assumption of the same dry matter loss for each storage surface. A
surface such as wood pallets that has the potential to protect the bottom of bales from dry matter
losses may have been put at a cost disadvantage.
