PATTERNS OF DIVERSITY AND ADAPTATION IN SOUTH AMERICAN HYSTRICOGNATH RODENTS

MICHAEL A. MARES AND RICARDO A. OJEDA

ABSTRACT

The distributional patterns of the hystricognath rodents of South America are analyzed in detail. Distributional maps are presented for all species and families of hystricognaths. The general adaptations of each group are described and compared to potentially equivalent species from other regions of the world. South America's hystricognaths are a diverse assemblage that fill ecological roles similar to those of several orders of mammals around the world, including the Hyracoidea and Artiodactyla.
The overall distribution of species numbers versus latitude and longitude (species density) shows that a complex group of familial distributions resulting from different biogeographic histories yields an apparently simple latitudinal species gradient. When

detailed statistical analyses (multiple regression) are applied to the data, however, it is shown that neither latitude nor longitude per se influence species number. Rather, the number of species at any particular latitude is the result of the available land area of the continent at that point.
Our results are contrasted with North American research suggesting that latitudinal gradients characterize mammalian distribution patterns. We suggest that patterns thus far elucidated can be explained either through simple areal effects or through differing biogeographic histories resulting in differential levels of adaptation to tropical and extratropical habitats.

INTRODUCTION

Among South America's more than 800 species of mammals, the hystricognath rodents comprise one of the most diversified, widespread, and least studied assemblages. Approximately 11 families, 41 genera, and 125 species are included within the hystricognaths (sensu Woods, this volume) of continental South America; they currently occupy habitats ranging from rainforest to desert, from sea lev'el to the highest puna, and are distributed across the length and breadth of South America (Table 1). Despite their ubiquity, no inclusive modern taxonomic revision has ever been done on any hystricognath species, genus, or family. As might be expected, there are many unanswered questions concerning the phylogenetic affinities of this group. Not only is the specific status of most forms known only incompletely, but many, if not most, genera are also poorly understood. Indeed, even the status of the familial categories is questionable for many groups.
The very limited data on systematics and distribution are reflected in the even more limited data on the ecology of hystricognaths. For most species, little more than anecdotal information is available on habitat selection, diet, reproduction, daily activity, behavior, and so forth. Of the 126 species, only about 10% have been examined ecologically in depth in the field (for example, Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris by Ojasti 1973; Galea musteloides, Cavia aperea, and Microcavia australis by Rood 1970, 1972; Galea spixii and Kerodon rupestris by Lacher 1981: Dasyprocta punctata by Smythe 1978 (in Central America); Lagostomus maximus by Llanos and Crespo 1952;

Lagidium peruanum by Pearson 1948; Ctenomys opimus, C. leucodon, and C. peruanum by Pearson 1959; Thrichomys apereoides by Streilein 1982a, 1982b, 1982c, 1982d, 1982e ). No species has been examined in detail in more than a single locality; thus we have no information on how particular behavioral or ecological adaptations might differ across the enormous range of biotic and climatic environments characteristic of South America.
In this report we offer a preliminary examination of the overall distribution of the hystricognath taxa and their patterns of adaptation. In a region as poorly studied as the Neotropics, it is expected that our data base is incomplete. Geographic ranges are poorly known, habitat, selection is known only at the broadest levels for most species, and the finer details of an animal's biology that allow a realistic approximation of the niche or of community structure have not yet been obtained. Nevertheless, we feel it is worthwhile to turn our attention to this group of rodents because of their pronounced degree of diversification from the ancestral stock. If any taxon exemplifies an explosive adaptive radiation, it is the hystricognaths. Many of the questions concerning coexistence, community development, adaptation across environmental gradients, and coevolution among tropically-adapted species, could be clarified through investigations on the biology of this fascinating group of mammals. We hope that this report will stimulate biologists to examine this neglected group of vertebrates.

METHODS

We have utilized as many publíshed sources as possible, plus our own field experience with many hystricognath species, to arrive at a determination of the geographic distribution of each species.---Arnong4he--more- impurtattnnagif léfirences we examined were Osgood (1912, 1943), Sanborn (1929), Tate (1935), Yepes (1935), Cabrera and Yepes (1940), Moojen (1948a, 19486), Pearson (1951), Cabrera (1953, 1960), Vieira (1955a, 19556), Roig (1962,
1965), Walker (1964), Creer (1965), Borrero (1967), Barlow (1969), Massoia (1970), Pine (1973), Mares (1973), Crespo (1974), Wetzel and Lovett (1974), Handley (1976), Husson (1978), Mann Fischer (1978), Myers and Wetzel (1979), Pine et al. (1979), Corbet
and Hill (1980), Olrog and Lucero (1981), Mares, Ojeda, and Kosco (1981), and Mares et al. (1981). We constructed a distribu-

tion map for each species based nn these and other references. The maps for all species within a family were then superimposed onto a cinglo Ettap to-arrive-zt -the famirttt ilistñbution. In addition to forming basic distribution maps for species and families, we divide(' the South American continent into 10-degree divisions of both latitude and longitude. The number of species per family occurring within each 10° block was determined and species density maps were constructed in this manner. Finally, we measured the
amount of territory of the South American continent lying within each 10° band of latitude and longitude and, usíng simple regressíon, multiple regression, and analysis of variante, examined how hystricognath species were distributed in relation to latitude, longitude, and land area.

RESULTS

THE HYSTRICOGNATHS Although the South American hystricognaths ( caviomorphs) are grouped into 11 families, such a taxonomic scheme is, at best, only an approximation of reality. Six mammalogists specializing in South American species could very easily arrive at six sepa-

rate taxonomic constructs. Newer techniques applied across many taxa and more data on these taxa will undoubtedly change the systematic listing herein presented.

Family Erethizontidae

This family of New World porcupines includes seven South American species distributed in three genera. No species has been examined in detail, either

taxonomically or ecologically. The family is distributed widely over the northern two-thirds of the continent (Fig. 1). Species density is lowest at the west-

ern, southern, and eastern margins, and highest in the central and northwestern tropical forest regions (Fig. 2). Species of the genus Coendou are the widest ranging (from southern Mexico to northern Argentina), while the other two apparently monotypic genera are limited to the mountainous regions of western Colombia (Echinoprocta rufescens) and central Brazil (Chaetomys subspinosus).
Family Caviidae The caviids form one of the highly diversified hystricognath groupings. Animals range in size from about 200 g (some Galea) to more than 15 kg (Dolichotis). This is one of the most widely distributed families, although their range in the tropical forest of central South America is not well known (Fig. 3). Their habitats include almost all major South American biomes. Most species are distributed in regions which do not support tropical rainforests, with high species densities occurring in the dry southcentral Andes (Fig. 2). Lowest species densities are found at the southern and western extremes of the cc*)ntinent. No single term describes the general role played by

these animals in any particular ecosystem. Kerodon is a rock specialist inhabiting the semiarid Caatinga of northeastern Brazil. In morphology, behavior, and general ecology, it strongly resembles the hyraxes (Procavia and Heterohyrax) of east Africa (for example, Hoeck 1975; Lacher 1981; Mares and Lacher manuscript; Fig. 4). Pediologus is the "cottontail" of the thorn scrub (Fig. 4; Mares, Ojeda and Kosco 1981), whereas Dolichotis is much like the jackrabbit of North America (Fig. 4; Mares et al. 1977). Microcavia, Galea, and Cavia are quite similar to North American ground squirrels in ecology and overall appearance (Mares et al. 1977).
Family Hydrochaeridae The single species, H. hydrochaeris, is distributed throughout tropical South America, extending at the southern range limits into northern and eastern Argentina (Fig. 16). The semiaquatic habits of this largest of rodents make it, ecologically and morphologically, a smaller version of the pygmy hippopotamus, Choeropsis liberiensis, of Africa (see for example, Bourliere 1970; Fig. 5).
Family Dinomyidae The single species in this family, Dinomys branickii, is found in the tropical forest on the lower slopes of the Andes of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Perú, Brazil, and Bolivia (Fig. 16). Ecologically, the species is practically unknown, although as Hershkovitz (1972) noted, in many of its traits it is reminiscent of the marmots (Marmota) of the Holarctic (Fig. 5).
Family Dasyproctidae We have foliowed Corbet and Hill (1980) and included the four genera, Cuniculus, Agouti, Dasyprocta and Myoprocta within this family. However, there is strong evidence that, in fact, two separate families are involved (see, for example Woods, this volume; Cabrera 1960). Under the latter scheme, Dasyprocta and Myoprocta would comprise the Dasyproctidae, whereas Agouti would subsume Cuniculus and be the sole genus of the family Agoutidae. For the purposes of our analyses however, the distribution of either the Dasyproctidae, sensu lato, or the more restrictive. Dasyproctidae and Agoutidae are similar (Figs. 2,6). Dubost (1968), Hershkovitz (1972), and Bouliere (1973) have remarked on the similarities between pacas (Cuniculus) and African chevrotains (for example, Tragulus meminna of India). Indeed, Dasyprocta is also similar to some chevrotains such as Tragulus javonicus of Java (see Fig. 5).
Family Chinchillidae This family is comprised of three genera and

perhaps six species distributed over the southern third of South America (Fig. 7). An examination of the species density (Fig. 8) shows that most species are associated with the Andean and pre-Andean mountain chains between 10° and 40° south latitude. Indeed, only the plain's viscacha, Lagostomus maximus, is found in habitats away from the mountains. Wilson (1975) comments on the ecological similarity between Lagostomus and the North American prairie dogs, Cynomys (compare for example, Llanos and Crespo 1952; King 1955). The montane genera are more like the rock squirrels of North America or Asia (Otospermophilus or Sciurotamias, respectively), particularly members of the genus Chinchilla. Lagidium, in body proportions and habits, is more like a rabbit than a ground squirrel.

Family Capromyidae The single member of this family is the nutria, Myocastor coypus which occurs over much of the southern third of South America in the lowlands (Fig. 18). Coypus are similar in body form and in overall life habits to the North American muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus, a murid rodent (Fig. 10). Swamps, lakes, rivers, and streams with nearby woodlands are the preferred habitats of the semiaquatic coypu.
Family Octodontidae This diverse family of rodents contains six genera and eight species having very restricted geographic distributions. In fact, the entire family has an Andean or pre-Andean distribution between 10° and

40° south latitude (Figs. 8 and 9). Some species are quite similar to the woodrats, Neotoma, of North America, particularly Octomys mimax (Mares et al. 1977; Fig. 10). However, Octodon degus of Chile is more like a ground squirrel in overall behavior, ecology, and diet (compare for example Fulk 1976; Cody et al. 1977). There are some similarities between some octodontids (for example Octodontomys gliroides) and the Petromyidae of Africa. Spalacopus cyanus is a largely fossorial rodent quite similar to North American gophers, family Geomyidae (for example, Reig 1970); it is known only from montane forests and shrublands of central Chile. Aconaemys fuscus is largely fossorial (for example, Walker 1964), although at times its burrow systems are more like Microtus runways (Greer 1965).
There is some question as to whether or not this family includes the genus Ctenomys (for example, Pascual et al. 1965: Reig 1970; Woods, this volume). The octodontids are probably the least studied family of South American hystricognaths. The phylogenetic relationships of the genera are not clear, almost all species are totally unstudied from the ecological standpoint, and even the exact composition of the family is in doubt. The geographic distributions of most of the species are uncertain; Massoia (1979), for

example, recently reported non-fossil skull remains of Octodon (perhaps O. bridgesi) from southern Argentina. Essentially nothing is known about Tympanoctomys barrerae.
One genus (Ctenomys) and perhaps 30 species are included within this family, which may, in fact, be a subfamily of the Octodontidae (Pascual et al. 1965). Ctenomys are fossorial rodents that strongly resemble other fossorial mammals throughout the world such as the gophers (Geomyidae) of North America (Fig. 10), or the bathyergids (Bathyergidae) of southern Africa. Members of this family are distributed south of 10° south latitude in all major habitats, although their distribution pattern in the Chao-Cerrado-forested areas of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil is not yet clear (Fig. 11). Most species are found between 10° and 40° south latitude and 55° and 70° west longitude (Fig. 8). Ctenomys occur from sea level to more than 4500 m elevation.
The systematic status of most forms is unclear. Few studies utilizing modern techniques have examined Ctenomys, although Reig and his colleagues have begun studying the genus (for example, Reig et al. 1965; Reig and Kiblisky 1968, 1969). Only Pearson (1959) has conducted a detailed ecological study of any of the species of Ctenomys. Our interpretation of the species comprising this genus (Table 1) is as open to question as any other with which we are familiar, but it in part reflects our familiarity with some species and their habitats.
Family Abrocomidae Only two species comprise the single genus Abrocoma -- A. bennettii and A. cinerea. These species are probably allopatric, with A. cinerea being a species of the high Andes of Perú, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile, whereas A. bennettii is found along the lower Andean slopes and foothills of Chile (Fig. 12). Abrocoma have not been studied ecologically in any detail, although Cody et al. (1977) remark that they are generally similar to species of North American woodrats, Neotoma. Clearly there is a strong resemblance in the external morphology of Abrocoma and Neotoma (Fig. 10).
Family Echimyidae This family of spiny rats is a diverse assemblage distributed through most of the tropical lowlands of South America between 10° north latitude and 30° south latitude (Fig. 13). They inhabit tropical rain forest, savannas, thorn scrub, and montane rain forest, although most species are found in the more mesic areas (Fig. 2). Thrichomys apereoides is the only echimyid to inhabit the semiarid Caatinga of northeastern Brazil (for example, Mares et al. 1981). Four-

teen genera and approximately 42 species comprise this family, although the taxonomic relationships of the species are poorly known. Almost none (for example, Proechimys in Panamá, Fleming 1970; Thrichomys in Brazil, Streilein 1982a, 1982b, 1982c, 1982d, 1982e) have been examined ecologically, and the geographic distribution of most species is not clear.
From what little general information is available, however, it is clear that a wide variety of niches are occupied by the members of this family. Species of Proechimys are similar to Old World Rattus or Cricetomys (Fig. 10), being primarily inhabitants of

dense forest, scrub forest, or woodlands, and having fairly broad herbivorous diets (including fruits and nuts). Euryzygomatomys and Carterodon appear to be somewhat like microtines, inhabiting tropical grasslands and savannas. Clyomys is the most fossorial echimyid and possesses adaptations characteristic of fossorial life, although these are not as pronounced as those of the ctenomyids. Thrichomys is in many respects reminiscent of woodrats, Neotoma, whereas Echimys are arboreal, nocturnal rats in some respects similar to such murids as Mesembriomys of the Australian forests.

DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS Latitudinal Patterns
Our best assessment of the geographic distribution of each of the 126 species of South American hystricognath rodents is given in Figs. 14-27 (see also Table 1). Undoubtedly the maps will have to be modified in the future as more data are obtained. Although they give only a rough approximation of actual species ranges, the maps might prove useful in orienting the student of South American mammalogy to the diversity of species of hystricognaths and to their approximate geographic location on the continent.
A comparison of all of the familial distributions discussed aboye shows that there is great variability in geographic distribution along the latitudinal gradient (Fig. 28), with some families being fairly widespread latitudinally, whereas most are much more restricted. The caviids extend over 60° of latitude, from about 5° north latitude to 55° south latitude, a distribution reflecting the available land area. Six families extend their ranges north of the equator; of these, only the caviids and the capybara extend southward into temperate regions. The echimyids, dasyproctids, erethizontids, and dinomyids are basically inhabitants of tropical forests and scrublands; none occurs south of 25° south latitude. Three of the remaining families are primarily Andean in

distribution. The chinchillas historically were found from near the equator to as far south as 45° south latitude. The Abrocomidae and Octodontidae each inhabit a 20° latitudinal band of Andean cordillera, with the former extending further northward than the latter. The ctenomyids and the capromyid each have an extensive latitudinal distribution covering approximately 40° of latitude, with the coypu being a lowland form found in the plains east of the Andes, and the burrowing Ctenomys occurring in all major habitats found south of 15° south latitude, be they lowland or montane.
The relationship between species density of all hystricognaths and latitude was examined by plotting the total number of species in each 10° latitudinal band (obtained from the maps depicting the geographic range of each family) against the degrees of latitude (Fig. 29). Clearly there are more species in the tropical portions of South America than in the extratropical areas; species density increases from the northern to the southern equatorial regions, at which point it rapidly decreases with increasing southerly latitude. Note however that maximum species density values do not occur at the equator proper, but rather are found just south of the equator between 10° and 20° south latitude.
If this pattern is dissected in such a manner that species density within non-monotypic families is examined for a relationship with latitude, it is apparent that the rather smooth curve of Fig. 30 is actually made up of a complex of different patterns. Only the Erethizontidae (and perhaps the Dasyproctidae) show a linear decrease in species density with increasing southerly latitude. The echimyids and caviids show maximum species density between 10° and 20° south latitude, with a decrease in species density both north of that region (that is, toward the equator) as well as further south. The ctenomyids do not reach maximum species density values until the 20° and 30° south latitude bands, while the octodontids actually increase in species density as southerly latitude increases.
In order to obtain a more detailed understanding of the possible relationship between latitude and species density, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the data that were utilized in forming Fig. 30 (Table 2). There is no significant association between species number and latitude per se, as is suggested by the F value of 4.57 (d.f. = I), which has a probability level lying between .10 and .05.
Longitudinal Patterns
The relationship between species density and longitude (with species density being the number of species of all hystricognaths occurring within 10° longitudinal bands) is shown in Fig. 31. Note that in general there is an increase in the number of species

with increasing longitude, with maximum species density occuring between 60° and 70° west longitude, and lower values for this parameter both east and west of this point.
To test the possible relationship between species density and longitude, an ANOVA was performed examining number of species and longitude (Table 3). The F value of 9.31 (d.f. 1) was comparable to that obtained for the latitudinal analysis and also was not significant (with P between .10 and .05).
HABITAT FACTORS South America supports a great variety of macrohabitats (Fig. 32). In Fig. 33 we examine the relationship of the numbers of genera and families regularly found within particular habitats. In the latter figure we have used somewhat more finelydivided categories than those given in the schematic map of vegetation. The greatest number of genera and families are found in tropical moist forest and in savanna habitats, the two major plant formations in South America. Most other major habitats support about the same numbers of genera and families of hystricognaths, whereas the páramo, beech forest, southern conifer forest and bamboo habitats support the fewest number of genera and families. The great diversity of habitats probably contributes to the high number of hystricognath species that are found today in South America.

Areal Patterns It was apparent to us from examining the relationships between species density and latitude, longitude and habitat selection that none of these parameters effectively explained the observed patterns of species distribution. Thus, while species density decreased with increasing southern latitude, maximum species density values occurred outside of the immediate equatorial region. Similarly, although there was a positive relationship between the number of species and increasing longitude, maximum numbers of species were found east of the highest longitudinal regions. The relationship between available land area and species density is shown in Fig. 34. Here we have plotted the number of species found in each 10° latitudinal band against the land area occurring

within each particular band. Clearly the number of hystricognath species found in any particular latitudinal band is directly related to the total land area encompassed by the particular strip. In Table 4 we examine the relationship between latitudinal area and species density. Note that area explains a significant amount of the variance in species density, with an F-value of 7.11 having a P between .05 and .025.
We attempted to obtain a finer resolution of the effects of area, latitude, and longítude on the number of species of hystricognaths by performing a multiple regression analysis (SPSS, Nie et al. 1975) of these various factors against species density (Table 5). In this analysis, the effect of each particular factor (for example, latitudinal area) is examined with the effects of the other confounding factors removed from

the analysis. Thus it is possible to remove the statistical effect of area on latitude or longitude and determine whether or not either (or both) of these factors has any independent (of area) effects on species number. As Table 5 indicates, latitudinal area

(without either latitude or longitude, per se, confounding the analysis) is highly significantly related to species number. Moreover, neither latitude nor longitude, per se, are significantly associated with species number.

DISCUSSION

It is difficult to discern exactly what sorts of adaptations the ancestral type of the South American hystricognaths might have possessed (for example, Wood and Patterson 1959: Lavocat 1973; Woods, this volume), but it is apparent that they underwent a great flowering during their period of relative isolation from other rodents, rabbits, or other potential competitors. In Figs. 4, 5 and 10 we have illustrated

some South American hystricognaths and their potential ecological equivalents in other ares of the world. Note that the hystricognaths possess various adaptations that are distributed among several orders of mammals throughout the world (for example, artiodactyls, lagomorphs, and hyraxes), and that ecological roles filled by myomorph, sciuromorph, or hystricomorph (Old World) rodents are filled in

often a very similar fashion by hystricognaths. Indeed, it is probably not mere chance alone that has resulted in the evolution of many types of largely small-bodied myomorph species in South America since their colonization of the continent from North America -- the large-bodied rodent niches were already well-filled by the hystricognaths. Small body size may have been the only workable strategy to successfully insinuate species into the South American rodent fauna.
Although the geographic distribution maps we utilized in our analyses must be considered with caution, it appears that what could easily have been interpreted as a typical latitudinal gradient in species

number (for a review of such gradients see Pianka 1966) is in fact the result of a complex set of interactions. Clearly both latitude and longitude appeared to have some relation to species number (Figs. 29, 31), but it was evident that total land area would probably play a role in the species density patterns. One reason that this was expected is because, unlike North America, South America's shape can be roughly approximated by two triangles. The first would have an approximately west northwest-east southeast base lying along the northern continental margin, with the other two legs of the triangle extending to a point at the southern most tip of the continent. Such a triangle, if area were an important factor in species density, would be expected to show a latitudinal relationship with species number, whether or not latitude itself, or some factors associated with latitude, were involved in the development of the pattern, since the area of the triangle decreases from north to south. Similarly, because the area of this triangle increases as one moves westward (as does longitude), it would be expected that areal effects would simulate longitudinal effects, whether or not longitude per se or associated factors were involved. The second triangle that can be fit to the shape of the South American continent is also a complicating factor in longitudinal analysis. If the base of a planar triangle extended at sea leve( across the continent, two legs of the triangle would meet along the ridge line of the Andes Mountains. This elevational triangle, with its highest points occurring along the western margin of the continent (where longitudinal values are also highest) would be expected to in-

fluente positively the number of species through a simple increase in habitat complexity and thus confound the effects of any purely longitudinal factors.
Using simple analysis of variance (Tables 2 - 4), we showed that land area was the primary determinant of species number, whereas neither latitude nor longitude were significantly related to species density. However, it must be remembered that this analysis was not able to consider the interactive effects of one factor on another. The multiple regression test, however, was able to examine each factor separately while subtracting the effects of the other factors. Thus we were able to establish that latitudinal area was by far the most important factor explaining species numbers, whereas longitude and latitude per se explained no significant amounts of variation in species number (Table 5).
Terborgh (1973) pointed out some very important points affecting species numbers in the Neotropics. He noted that habitats immediately north and south of the equator have similar climates and that the climate within about ± 20° latitude of the equator is fairly independent of latitudinal effects on temperature or moisture. He also reiterated the importante of the fact that, because of the spherical shape of the earth, there is more sur face area per degree latitude at the equator than in the temperate zones. Because of these facts, a higher level of species richness is ex-

pected in the tropics, whereas habitat diversity is expected to be lower due to climatic homogeneity. Thus Terborgh's analysis would suggest that, other things being equal, there should be more species, but fewer habitats, in tropical regions.
In order to definitively test the accuracy of these predictions we would need a detailed analysis of macrohabitats across South America, as well as a much finer level of understanding of the individual geographic distributions of animals. For example, our data examined the presence or absence of a species within an area of roughly 1,000,000 km 2 at the equator, which was about as fine a level of resolution as our information on the distribution patterns would allow. Even at this gross scale, however, some facts are clear.
There appears to be a greater number of habitats in South America between 20° and 30° south latitude than there are between 0° and 10° south latitude, and the extratropical habitats are of smaller areal extent. This increased number of habitats ensues even though there is less land area in the southern portions of the continent. Since increased land area has a positive effect on speciation and a negative effect on extinction (compare for example, Mayr 1965; MacArthur 1972: Terborgh 1973), it would be expected that the region immediately surrounding the equator would support increased number of species. As we

point out below, however, the pattern of the distribution of South American macrohabitats does not fit a simple tropical-temperate climatological scheme. Furthermore, our data on the hystricognath rodents do not fit the expected pattern as closely as might at first have been supposed for such an oid faunal assemblage that is presumably at or near equilibrium with its continental area.
Even a large scale view of the macrohabitats of South America (Fig. 32) indicates that there can be pronounced habitat diversity well within the actual limits of the tropics. An examination of the habitats in the region of the 15° south latitude band, for example, shows a large number of habitats that contribute a great deal to the diversity of species across the continent in this area. Here are found the semiarid Caatinga of northeastern Brazil (with its many and varied macrohabitats, see Mares et al. 1981); the Atlantic rainforest, a low aspect, but species rich, montane forest; the Cerrado, an extensive system of savannas and gallery forests; elements of the Amazonian lowland tropical rainforest; the semideciduous forest; Andean rainfortsts; high Andean Páramo habitats; xeric montane habitats; and lowland desert habitats. This great diversity of habitats lying north of the Tropic of Capricorn argues against Terborgh's suggestion of lower habitat diversity within the tropics. Given this high level of macrohabitat differentiation, however, it is easy to see its effect on species density values. There is little doubt that part of the high level of species density values noted for the hystricognaths is a result of the great habitat diversity on the continent, even within the area of the tropics. However, habitat diversity does not necessarily relate directly to total land area.
One possible interpretation of Fig. 29 would be to note that, if the species occurring between 10° north latitude and 20° south latitude were summed (to yield the "homogeneous tropical" assemblage), there would be a pronounced decrease in species numbers from the tropical to the temperate latitudes. Examination of Fig. 30, however, points out that the overall pattern is actually composed of several complex and distinctive familia! distributions. The Andean families (chinchillids, octodontids, abrocomids, and many ctenomyids) are not subject to the same climatological forces affecting species in the lowland tropics. The caviids, being primarily extratropical animals, are also not subject to the simple relationship involving climate and surface area. If our data did not extend beyond the simple parameter, number of hystricognath species, it would be tempting indeed to offer this group as an excellent example supporting Terborgh's hypothesis of tropical species richness.
The history of the South American mammal fauna is a controversia) topic (for example, Marshall 1979;

Simpson 1980; Mares 1980; Reig 1981), but there is strong evidence that the climatological changes engendered by the glacial events for the Pleistocene had a great effect on the speciation process on the continent (for example, Simpson and Haffer 1978). The very diversity of topography, microclimate, and vegetation which characterizes South America made it an ideal area for the formation of numerous Pleistocene refugia; these allowed isolation of species into different populations that then diverged from the original type (for example, Haffer 1969: Vanzolini and Williams 1970). This species multiplication system (Mares 1979) would greatly increase the numbers of species in South America as later climatic changes allowed the newly formed species to merge into more complex communities. Rosenzweig (1975) pointed out the importance of greater land area in affording opportunities for geographic barriers to form, and his reasoning can be extended to the formation of Pleistocene refugia. Because such refugia develop in areas where habitat discontinuities afford localities where particular macrohabitats can be isolated during periods of climatic change, the probability of refugial formation should be a direct function of available land mass, particularly because larger land masses allow not only more space within which barriers can form and thereafter affect topography and climate, but also allow rainfall gradients to form where weather systems must move over extensive land areas. Thus the broader the continent, the greater the probability that moisture gradients will be formed or that particular regions will be uplifted to diversity topography. These factors, coupled with the greater area in which isolated refugia may develop, make South America an ideal continent for this type of speciation mechanism to have occurred. Finally, the physical effects of glaciation in the southern portions of the continent where temperatures are lower would also result in lower levels of speciation via the refugial process. Hence, in South America we note a pronounced and significant relationship between latitudinal area and species number which probably has resulted from the well known relationship between land area, speciation and extinction (Mayr 1965) and the added factor of Pleistocene refugial effects on the continent.
A finer analysis of distribution patterns may well show that longitude has an effect on species number and there are several possible reasons for this. There are pronounced rainfall gradients in South America as one moves from east to west; these would be expected to have an effect on the number of species occurring in an area. In the immediate equatorial region rainfall generally increases as one moves westward (Eidt 1968), although there is much variation in rainfall on a microclimatic scale (Markham 1972). At about 10° south latitude there is an even more pro-

1982 MARES AND OJEDA--HYSTRICOGNATH ADAPTIONS 429

(compare, for example, Cabrera 1957; Hall and Kelson 1959). Bat species richness might be expected to increase rapidly as one approached the limits of the tropical lowlands from North America and, indeed, that is precisely the pattern described (McCoy and Connor 1980). In essence what we are seeing is the north temperate bat fauna reaching its southernmost adaptive limits in the region where the tropically-evolved fauna is extremely diverse and reaching its northernmost adaptive limits.
The situation with quadrupeds is similar, with one important exception. These species are of lower vagility. The great increase in environmental harshness (from the viewpoint of a tropically-adapted mammal) of the Central American and Mexican habitats is pronounced, perhaps more so than for animals which have evolved in temperate regions (compare, for example, Patterson and Pascual 1963; Janzen 1967; Webb 1978; Marshall 1981). There are two very distinct group of quadrupeds included in Wilson's (1974) analysis -- those that evolved in temperate North America and those that have their biogeographic history in South America (for example, Marshall 1981). The former group was adapted for the fluctuating environments and harsh climates of the north, whereas the latter was adapted to the , highly productive and climatically stable habitats of the tropical lowlands. As one proceeds southward in North America, one is moving from the habitats to which the northern species had evolved to the filter bridge (for example, Simpson 1980) of the wet forestdry forest-grassland-scrubland habitats of Central America and Mexico. Hence one moves from a region wherein the northern species are highly adapted to one where they are less adapted; correspondingly, their species numbers decrease with decreasing latitude. In the Mexican and Central American low-

land habitats, however, the great increase in tropically-adapted bats is not paralleled by as pronounced an increase in tropically-adapted quadrupeds. Many South American families of quadrupeds (for example Echimyidae, Didelphidae, Dasypodidae) are represented by only one or two species in this region. The overall result is that quadrupeds appear to have no relationship to latitude. In fact, northern quadrupeds decrease in number as do their volant counterparts. Tropical forest bats extend further north in greater numbers than do their quadrupedal equivalents, so they in fact affect the total numbers of species in Mexico and Central America in different ways; however, these patterns are not the result of different leveis of adaptation to the moist tropics, but rather are related to different degrees of mobility.
McCoy and Connor suggest that envíronmental patchiness is greater in the tropics and is related to speciation patterns. The Pleistocene climatic events may have resulted in a greater degree of habitat patchiness than is today found in temperate latitudes. Although the probability of refugial formation was greater in northern South America because of its greater land mass, an increased number of species in this region today might not be detectable as a purely areal relationship. The fact that the larger land mass supports more species than smaller portions of the continent is not surprising and probably accounts for the greatest part of the land area effect on species number that we have detected. We feel, however, that the greater number of species found today in tropical South America derives from historical causes as well as proximate spatial factors. We suggest that this pattern will hold for other organisms as data accrue on plant and animal distributions on the continent.
