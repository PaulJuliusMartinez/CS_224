Contemporary Pragmatism

1.1. The siren call of moral imagination

In my introduction, I suggested that the idea to connect imagination
with morality is not trivial and has generally met resistance in the history
of philosophy, but has become more influential today. What can explain
this success? I can think of at least the following reasons.

First, the vocabulary of moral imagination appears to be an attractive
alternative or addition to contemporary views of moral deliberation that
focus on an agent’s will, desires, principles, and reasons.1 Such views
seem incomplete and inadequate since they tend to portray moral delib-
eration as being separated from others, rely on capacities that seem
separated from other personal capacities such as feeling and imagina-
tion, and their dry2 and abstract vocabulary appears hopelessly alienated
from concrete practices and people’s own understanding of these prac-
tices. The concept of moral imagination, proposed by pragmatists (for
example Johnson 1993, Fesmire 2003), moral sentiment theorists (for
example Nussbaum 2001), and others (for example Murdoch) remedies
these handicaps. By focussing on imagination, the vocabulary of moral
imagination promises to open up new spaces of moral experience. I will
show in this book that the expectations and hopes of moral imagination
theorists are warranted, but that their approach faces serious problems
as well.

Secondly, some moral philosophers today are particularly dissatisfied
with the Kantian approach to moral philosophy and the foundation-
alist, principle-seeking tradition it stands in. Pragmatists object to this
approach3 and present their view as an alternative or at least a substan-
tial change to what they call ‘absolutism’. Johnson argues in Moral
Imagination against the view that moral reasoning consists primarily

in ‘discerning the appropriate universal moral principle that tells us
the single “right thing to do” in a given situation’ (Johnson 1993: 1),
against the Kantian dichotomy morality versus prudence and against
the view that there is ‘a single standard of human good’ (Johnson 1993:
252). And in John Dewey and Moral Imagination Fesmire argues that the
Kantian tradition has overlooked the importance of imagination and
calls for abandoning what he calls ‘the pursuit of a bedrock principle’
(Fesmire 2003: 3), ‘the hyper-rationalist quest for the grand theory or
meta-ethical principle’ (57), and ‘the faculty psychology of the eight-
eenth century’ (61). In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, I will further discuss these
claims when discussing the danger of relativism and conventionalism in
the pragmatist approach, and in Chapter 7, I will show that this picture
of Kantian and ‘absolutist’ moral theory is too one-sided and is better
accommodated for conceiving of an important and necessary moral role
of imagination than these authors suppose.

Thirdly, perhaps another normative thrust can explain the success of
theories of moral imagination. Instead of separation, these new theoret-
ical avenues seem to project the possibility of moral harmony between
persons, between personal capacities, and between theory and prac-
tice. I will show this in the next sections and chapters, in particular in
Chapter 3. I start with looking at contemporary pragmatist theory and
the role it assigns to imagination in moral deliberation.

Note that there are many ‘pragmatisms’ and pragmatists. In this part
of the book, I limit myself to Dewey and some contemporary thinkers
inspired by Dewey (including Putnam). In Part III I will discuss Mead.
This selection implies that others such as James or Rorty will receive less
attention (although I will mention them where appropriate). However,
a comprehensive discussion of pragmatism and an analysis of the simil-
arities and differences within pragmatism is not my aim in this book.
An interesting work on Dewey and his interpreters is Beyond Realism and
Anti-realism (Hildebrand 2003), to which I shall refer where appropriate.

1.2. Roles: The imagination wizard

My systematic answer to the question of the role of imagination begins
with an overview of the roles of imagination as found in the pragmatist
literature: the projection of future scenarios, the use of imagination to
put yourself in someone else’s shoes, the projection of personal and
common ideals of life, our use of moral metaphors when we reason, the
artistic expression of moral indignation, improvisation and tuning to
create an action option and to reach agreement, the projection of images

of society, politics, and technology, the projection of a moral self-image
or moral images of others, and the role of images and metaphor in
moral theory. It seems that imagination is a kind of wizard4 for moral
theory: it can do an amazing amount of tricks and it appears to open
up a new perspective on moral experience and moral reasoning. In
the next chapter, I will discuss its problems, but the magic of ‘moral
imagination’ cannot be denied. Consider the following roles. In contrast
to the literature, I will discuss these roles in a systematic way.

1.2.1. The projection of future scenarios
Future scenarios can be concerned with individual actions or collective
actions, thus we can distinguish between the projection of a personal
future and a collective future. Future scenarios are highly relevant for
moral reasoning to the extent that the consequences of our actions
matter morally. This does not imply that taking future scenarios into
account in our reasoning is consequentialist per se; there may be other
considerations we want to take into account. (Note that pragmatists put
an emphasis on consequences, which, in spite of their fierce opposition
to utilitarianism as a principle-based account, shows at least one prox-
imity to it – and to other consequentialist moral theories.) An important
and necessary role of imagination is that it allows us to explore the
consequences of our individual and collective actions. According to
Johnson, ‘we need to explore imaginatively what it might mean, in
terms of possibilities and enhanced meaning and relationships, for us to
perform this or that action’ (Johnson 1993: 187). Our projection of scen-
arios (as opposed to one single image – see below) takes a narrative form.
Since our lives themselves have a narrative structure (196), imagination
allows us ‘to explore the consequences of decisions and commitments
over an extended period of time’ (197). Following Rorty and Nussbaum,
Johnson suggests literature as a way to engage in such an exploration –
he calls fiction a laboratory in which we can explore the implications
of character and choice (199). However, this claim should not be inter-
preted as a defence of an exclusive focus on literature, but as a recom-
mendation of literary exploration as an aid to the projection of scenarios
we engage in the real, non-fictional world. When we deliberate, we test
out various scenarios in our imagination. We tell stories to ourselves to
consider the implications of our choices. I guess this is what Johnson
means with imaginatively envisioning possibilities for acting, which he
defines as ‘the ability to imaginatively discern various possibilities for
acting within a given situation and to envision the potential help and
harm that are likely to result from a given situation’ (Johnson 1993: 302).

14 Pragmatism and Technology

Thus it seems to me that at least this part of the theory of moral imagin-
ation is an interpretation of consequentialism. It seems to involve the
implicit argument that it is a moral requirement to consider the possible
consequences of our actions. However, pragmatists argue that this is
not primarily a matter of calculation, as many utilitarianists think and
many professionals such as engineers and economists practice, but of
imagination. The model for the perfect moral reasoner in this approach
is not the human computer but the artist (author, story-teller, painter,
director, and so on). Moral reasoning becomes an art:

We portray a situation, delineate character, formulate problems, and
mould events. When we act we engage in various forms of creative
making: we compose situations, build relationships, harmonise
diverse interests, balance competing values and goods, design insti-
tutional practices, and orchestrate interpersonal relations. This is not
merely an optional way of describing what we do, it is a precise
account of what morally sensitive and perceptive people must do.
(Johnson 1993: 212)

In John Dewey and Moral Imagination (2003), Fesmire endorses this view
of moral reasoning as an art, in particular the art of drama. He argues
that when we encounter a problem, alternatives ‘are tested in thought
as we imaginatively envision them carried out’ until a solution is found
(Fesmire 2003: 35). He calls this ‘creatively tapping a situation’s possib-
ilities’ (65): imagination ‘amplifies perception beyond the immediate
environment’ (66). This imagination is not the exclusive possession of
artists; non-artists are also invited to use moral imagination. For Fesmire,
as for Johnson, deliberation is deeply social. Fesmire understands delib-
eration as dramatic rehearsal: ‘To deliberate is to co-author a dramatic
story with environing conditions in community with others’ (Fesmire
2003: 78). Life narratives interplay with others, action is meaningless
in isolation. We must rely on ‘pooled, social intelligence’ (82) to solve
moral problems. Thus the normative implication of Fesmire’s descriptive
account of deliberation is that the projection of future scenarios is an
imaginative and social process and that we should cultivate this skill.

1.2.2. Putting yourself in someone else’s shoes
Following the influential work of Nussbaum we can consider another
role of imagination: empathy, defined by Johnson as ‘the ability to
imagine ourselves in different situations and conditions at past and
future times’ (Johnson 1993: 199), in particular we can put ourselves in

Contemporary Pragmatism 15

someone else’s shoes. I will say more about empathy in Part II of this
book, but it is worth looking at pragmatist discussions of the term at
this point. Johnson argues that Hume did make a too rigid separation
between reason and feeling. Instead he proposes ‘a blending of feeling,
imagination, and reason’ (200). He does not explain how this works, but
the moral role of empathy is that we learn to inhabit the world of others
(200) and therefore build a common world: moral imagination is public
and shared (201). Following Dewey, Fesmire also refers to empathetic
projection, which he defines as ‘entering by imagination into the situ-
ation of others’ (Fesmire 2003: 65). Fesmire accuses Kant of conceiving
of empathy as morally worthless. Instead he thinks it is crucial in moral
reasoning. In Kearney’s words, ‘without this imaginative ability [ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ]
to put oneself in others’ shoes, to identify oneself with their actions,
thoughts or feelings, it is difficult to see how moral sentiment or reason
could operate at all’ (Kearney 1998: 230).

1.2.3. The projection of ideals of life
Moral deliberation can be concerned not only with single decisions and
acts, but also with our personal life as a whole. And even if we deliberate
about single acts, this deliberation can be informed by personal ideals
of life. We may choose one option since it fits and confirms our ideal of
how our life should be. This ideal is in turn influenced by ideals of life
and personhood present in the culture and society in which we live. The
same holds for reasoning about collective decisions and the ideals of
collective life that may inform this reasoning. One form such collective
ideal can take is that of an utopia. These utopias need not be political, as
many people think, but concerns all dimensions of collective life. In Das
Prinzip Hoffnung, Ernst Bloch (1959) provides an overview of utopian
projects in the history of ideas. He discusses utopias in the fields of
medicine, social systems, technology, architecture, geography, art, and
what he calls ‘wisdom’. He provides examples such as Thomas More,
Bacon, Dante, and Kant (the intelligible kingdom). Again these ideals of
collective life are embedded in a social and cultural context.

The role of imagination in such ideals of personal and collective life
is that of the projection of images that illustrate, express, and construct
these ideals. For example, the catholic church has always projected
images of Christ and the life of Christ, holding up a moral ideal of life to
people. We may also think about images in commercials that express, if
not construct ways of life. Kearney refers to this role of imagination as
the ‘utopian’ and the ‘testimonial’ power of imagination (Kearney 1998:
226). According to him, the image of Christ and Christian narratives are

testimonial since they exemplify an otherwise abstract rule (230). But I
believe this claim is too weak: they not only exemplify moral rules, but
also construct an ideal of the moral life as a whole.

1.2.4. Metaphor
Images do not only enter moral deliberation as elements external to
language. Rather they are interwoven with our moral language in the
form of metaphors. When we reason, we use moral metaphors. For
example, we say of person or a moral problem that it is a ‘dirty’ person
or ‘dirty’ case. We say that a politician ‘washes his hands in blood’.
Metaphor is so much part of our moral language that we hardly notice
its role.

In Moral Imagination, Johnson (1993) argues that moral reasoning is
an imaginative activity based not on universal laws but on metaphors
in at least two ways: moral concepts are defined metaphorically, and
the way we conceptualise a particular situation depends on metaphors
(Johnson 1993: 2). Again this makes moral reasoning deeply social, since
we share imaginative structures with others. Johnson’s arguments are
based on empirical research in cognitive science and linguistics. In 1980,
he argued (with Lakoff) in Metaphors We Live By that metaphors are
not just a device of poets; rather they are part of everyday speech,
perception, and thought – moral and non-moral (Lakoff and Johnson
1980). In his 1993 book, he draws the implications for moral reasoning.
He distinguishes the following ways in which metaphor plays a role in
moral deliberation:

Metaphor enters our moral deliberation in three ways: (1) It gives
rise to different ways of conceptualising situations. (2) It provides
different ways of understanding the nature of morality as such
(including metaphorical definitions of
the central concepts of
morality, such as will, reason, purpose, right, good, duty, well being,
etc.). (3) Metaphor also constitutes a basis for analogising and moving
beyond the ‘clear’ or prototypical cases to new cases. It gives us
constrained ways to pursue these metaphorical extensions. It thus
allows us to learn from experience in a way that is necessary if we are
to grow in our moral understanding. (Johnson 1993: 10)

An example of a metaphor that is morally relevant is what Johnson calls
the ‘moral accounting metaphor’: people can accumulate moral ‘credit’
and moral ‘debt’ (Johnson 1993: 49). He also claims that our moral

language is grounded in structures of bodily experience (Johnson 1993:
61), for example, someone can be said to be ‘upright’, ‘pure’, and so on.
Johnson’s emphasis on social–cultural environment and bodily struc-
ture is shared by Fesmire. For contemporary pragmatists and their prede-
cessors, the weight is not so much on the individual, autonomous
self, but on the way environment changes, behavioural patterns,
symbolic systems, stories, beliefs, metaphors, and so on make up
our self as cultural beings. Furthermore we are at the same time
embodied. For Fesmire and others, there is no barrier between nature and
culture.

1.2.5. Art
The moral role of art in moral deliberation can be conceived of in
various ways. I already referred to the production of images as testi-
monies and expressions of ideals of life, to the narrative structure
our lives are said to have, to Nussbaum’s claim that literature can
stimulate the moral imagination, and to Fesmire’s use of dramatical
rehearsal as a metaphor for moral deliberation. To these roles we
may add at least one not considered in the literature I looked at:
the intentions of artists themselves – some artists and sometimes – to
create work of arts with a moral message. Artists may express their
moral indignation in a work of art and appeal to the public’s moral
sentiments.

1.2.6. Improvisation and tuning
Another role of imagination, discussed by Fesmire, is improvisation and
tuning to create an action option and to reach agreement. This role is
related to empathy, but is worth discussing on its own since here the
use of empathy is not understood as an individual act but as a means
to reach social harmony and agreement. To discuss this, Fesmire uses
music, not drama, as a metaphor for moral reasoning. In particular, in
his chapter on ‘The Deweyan Ideal’ he helpfully compares moral reas-
oning with jazz improvisation (Fesmire 2003: 93–6). He writes about
the ‘harmony and discord of daily interpersonal life’ and stresses the
empathetic dimension of ‘moral compositions’ (93). Why is empathy
needed? Jazz improvisation is not completely anarchic: ‘aesthetic right-
ness’ and coordination must be reached, and this is difficult. ‘One must
improvise. At our best, we skilfully respond to each other with the aim
of harmonizing interests. But coordinated impromptu thinking is diffi-
cult’ (Fesmire 2003: 94). Empathy (or sympathy, as Fesmire calls it here)

MAC/IAPS

Page-17

18 Pragmatism and Technology

is needed for all members ‘to bend for the common result’ (94). Impro-
visation is an interpersonal activity:

A jazz musician [ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ] takes up the attitude of others by catching
a cadence from the group’s signals while anticipating the group’s
response to her own signals. Drawing on the resources of tradition,
memory, and long exercise, she plays into the past tone to discover
the possibilities for future tones in the way moral imagination enables
us to see the old in terms of the possible. (Fesmire 2003: 94)

Although there is no right way to do this, it is not arbitrary. The members of
the group must listen to others. Fesmire claims that ‘it would not romanti-
cise jazz to observe that beauty in improvisation emerges as members revel
in supporting others, not when they jockey for a solo’ (Fesmire 2003: 94).
But ‘discordance is always possible’ (95). Following jazz musician Michael
Harper, Fesmire compares improvisation to a conversation: ‘The problem
is that sometimes people don’t always understand what the tone of the
conversation is’ (Harper quoted by Fesmire 2003: 95), as is the case in other
interpersonal interactions. ‘Moral-agents/patients must respond empath-
ically to each other instead of imposing insular designs, and they must
rigorouslyimaginehowotherswillrespondtotheiractions.Thisislearned,
with experience and practice’ (Fesmire 2003: 95). Fesmire and Dewey stress
‘the possibility of growth or maturation’ (98). Growing itself, then, is an
ideal, ‘a moral end’ (Fesmire 2003: 99). But since there are no separate
selves, Fesmire says, this Deweyan ideal is not one of ‘self-realisation’ since
‘there are no separate selves to realise’ (100). Rather the goal is the common
good. The imagination Fesmire and Dewey talk about is a ‘social imagina-
tion’ (106; Fesmire’s emphasis).

1.2.7. Images of society, technology, politics, (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2)
Earlier I mentioned ideals of collective life and utopia. This may falsely
suggest that imagination is only relevant in normative projections of the
unreal, non-existing or not-yet-existing. Rather imagination also has an
important descriptive role in our representation or perception of (what
we believe to be) the present, the real. When we reason about a collective
moral problem, we rely on images of society, technology, politics, and so
on. For example, if we perceive society as the sum of individuals in the
way atoms are related to each other, our moral reasoning will be different
than if we see society as an organic whole. We can distinguish between
images of a certain domain as a whole (for example technology) and
images related to the perception of particular societies, technologies, and

so on. For example, images from Hiroshima and the Chernobyl disaster
influence our perception of nuclear technology (Coeckelbergh 2006b).

Contemporary Pragmatism 19

1.2.8. Images of self and others
We also have images of ourselves and of other persons, including moral
self-images and moral images of others. These images can become the
object of deliberation. Pragmatist thinking about moral identity stresses
the role of imagination in changing our own identity. Johnson argues
that we can use imagination to change ourselves: we can imagine new
dimensions of our character, ‘stretching ourselves beyond our present
identity’ (Johnson 1993: 203). Imagination is a means of personal
change. The conceptions of ourselves are not fixed. Velleman argues in
Practical Reflection (1989) and subsequent work that agents make sense
of themselves by making up stories, by being involved in long-range
deliberation making long-term plans, and by making up self-images.
Influenced by James he writes:

Our options are as variable as the intentions that we could effectively
form; our characters are as variable as the self-images that we could
effectively endorse; and yet we can never be sure of having exhausted the
possibilities, since we can always try to invent new self-fulfilling concep-
tions of ourselves and our options. Hence the deliberative question is
not just how an agent like us should choose among options like ours
but first what we and our options should be like. We have to invent
our predicament before we can resolve it, and most of the work gets
done in the invention, not the resolution. Deliberation is a creative
and open-ended endeavour. It is the process by which we rewrite our
lives, and its principles are those of lucid composition. (Velleman
1989: 258; his emphasis)

Velleman argues that this holds not only for practical reasoning, but
for moral reasoning as well. When we ask ourselves the question ‘Is this
me?’ we are engaged in moral evaluation, and according to Velleman
sympathy is a requirement of good, rational reasoning (Velleman 1989:
305–7). Moreover he shares pragmatist views when stressing that apart
from the self-knowledge of individual, solitary people we should also
consider social self-understanding (310–13) – although he spends much
less time on the latter than on the former. Finally Velleman thinks that
‘being moral is the ultimate form of making sense’ of ourselves (318).
Although he does not explicitly mention the role of imagination here,

June 30, 2007 9:54

MAC/IAPS

Page-19

0230_55279X_05_cha01

20 Pragmatism and Technology

it is clear that the creation of self-images, of new (future) options, and
of one’s own narrative necessarily requires the use of imagination.

1.2.9. Images and metaphor in moral theory
Image and metaphor pervade moral theory. Even moral theories
that reject any connection between imagination and morality, and
emphasise reason or rationality, rely implicitly on imagination. For
example, Plato’s moral philosophy is partly based on the narrative and
metaphor of the cave. Fesmire refers to Kant’s image of a kingdom of
ends and the utilitarian metaphor of deliberation as calculation (Fesmire
2003: 60). This argument about the role of imagination in philosophical
theory deserves further development, but I need to be brief about it here
not to distract from my main line of argument. But we can learn from
pragmatist and other metaphor theories that it is illuminating to pay
attention to metaphors used in philosophical writing. For example, in
Chapter 2 I will discuss use of the terms ‘guidance’ and ‘constraint’ in
relation to the role of imagination.

1.2.10. Conclusion: imagination as moral movement
Having shown that and how imagination plays various roles in moral
deliberation, we may wonder if these roles have something in common.
I observe that the role of imagination in moral reasoning is either under-
stood in terms of the role of objects (images) or as a verb (the act of
imagination). If we say ‘the role of imagination’ in moral reasoning we
mean either the role of images in moral reasoning or the role of acts of
imagination in moral reasoning. Such acts of imagination seem to rely
on the notion of imagination as projection. And here we can distinguish
between two kinds of projection. In his famous paper ‘Imagination and
the Self’ Williams distinguishes between two modes of the imagina-
tion: imagining a certain thing distinct from myself that is such and
such, on the one hand, and imagining being such and such, on the
other hand (Williams 1973: 44). I propose to view these two modes as
corresponding to two basic moral roles of the imagination: imagining
the consequences of my actions and imagining being someone else. All
other roles discussed above either refer to the role of images or to the
role of imagining consequences or being someone else. My hypothesis,
then, is that imagination allows moral movement: it allows us to move
to the other and to the future. This is, as far as I can see at this point,
what the roles of imagination discussed here have in common. I will
return to this hypothesis later (end of Chapter 8), after I have further
developed my argument in the course of the book, to see if ‘imagination

Contemporary Pragmatism 21

as moral movement’ is indeed a helpful way of summarizing the roles
of imagination I analysed.

1.3. Implications for moral theory

If these are the roles of imagination in moral reasoning (and moral
deliberation in particular), what are the implications for moral theory?
Although pragmatists such as Johnson and Fesmire do not dismiss other
moral theories in their entirety – they claim that they can be of prag-
matic use – they reject their ‘foundationalist’ and ‘absolutist’ aspect.
Their criticisms in this respect are mainly (but not exclusively) directed
against Kant and Kantian moral theory. I will offer my objections against
parts of their interpretation of Kant in the next chapter and in Chapter 7,
but first I will summarise their arguments.

1.3.1. Against foundationalism and absolutism
Pragmatists are not opposed to principles as such, but argue that they
do not play a central and foundational role in ethics. Johnson claims
that moral reasoning is not based on universal laws and is not a matter
of deduction but, rather, based on metaphor in the way explained
earlier. In this view, moral principles do still play a role, but instead of
prescriptions they are summaries of the collective (learning) experience
of people. Following Dewey, he sees rules as guides rather than recipes
for action. Principles are the crystallisation of insights that emerge from
experience (Johnson 1993: 105). Rather than trying to find moral laws,
then, we should cultivate moral imagination (12). Imagination’s role in
relation to principles is that it allows us to imagine the implications of
taking certain principles as primary (106). According to Johnson, there
is no ultimate ordering principle but a ‘diversity of goods’5 (186). Given
this condition, we need moral imagination to explore what it means
for us to perform this or that action (187) but moral imagination would
not tell us what to do. For Johnson, this is not the task of moral theory
anyway. Its task is rather to enhance our understanding of moral prob-
lems and moral reasoning. Moral theory does not provide prescriptions
but gives ‘general guidance that comes from enhanced moral under-
standing and self-knowledge’ (199).

Johnson argues against a rigid separation of the aesthetic from the
moral. Morality is not the search for moral laws, but ‘the ongoing
imaginative exploration of possibilities for dealing with our problems’
and ‘the means for going beyond our selves [ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ] toward imagined
ideals of what we might become’ (Johnson 1993: 209). Such imaginative

22 Pragmatism and Technology

exploration requires continuous experimentation which may imply the
violation of accepted roles. We may miss some possibilities and ways of
life. Furthermore what we need morally is not a fixed procedure but skills
to cope with moral problems. Johnson concludes that moral problems
are not solved by having moral laws, but by using imagination. And if
there is an obligation, it is one to cultivate our moral imagination (215).
With his view Johnson criticises some assumptions of what he calls
‘Moral Law folk theory’ and ‘our Enlightenment conception of morality’.
Is morality objective? If there is any such thing as moral objectivity,
Johnson thinks it does not consist in having a ‘God’s eye point of
view’, ‘but rather in a specific kind of reflective, exploratory, and critical
process of evaluation, carried out through communal discourse and prac-
tice’ (Johnson 1993: 217; his emphasis). Furthermore Johnson criticises
the dichotomy ‘morality versus prudence’ if this dichotomy amounts to
the claim that most of what goes on in our deliberations is irrelevant
to the morality of our actions. Similarly, he considers the dichotomy
‘moral theory versus moral psychology’ to amount to a narrowing down
of the scope of morality as he understands it. Rather we should be
concerned with describing how people do in fact make decisions in
actual practices. Finally he does not think there exists ‘a single standard
of human good that presents itself as nothing more than a system of
obligations’ (249). Johnson instead proposes to view morality as having
a broad scope: ‘morality reaches, in varying degrees, into most aspects
of our lives’ (252). And this question of this scope must be kept open,
since our conception of morality must change with evolving experi-
ence. (Perhaps we will extend the scope to embrace other forms of life
than humans.) This does not mean that we cannot keep what Johnson
calls ‘our noblest Enlightenment Ideals’ (255), but he proposes that
we should revise them in an empirical light. For example, respect is
not an absolute duty stemming from pure reason but a requirement
for living together in harmony, moral principles encapsulate collective
wisdom derived from shared moral experience, our freedom is embodied
and imagination allows modest transformations in our experience and
identity, and criticism is possible but not from an absolute totalising
perspective (256–7). Against absolutism, Johnson offers suggestions for
what he calls a ‘humanly realistic morality’ (259). With such a morality,
we’re never sure where we will end, ‘guided only by our ideals of what
we, and others, and our shared world might become’ (260).

Fesmire echoes this criticism of moral absolutism and foundation-
alism and develops it by drawing on the classical pragmatist tradi-
tion. According to him, rather than the pursuit of a ‘bedrock principle’

Contemporary Pragmatism 23

(Fesmire 2003: 3) we need ‘a shift in the centre of gravity of ethics
from foundational principles to imagination’ (3). He starts his argument
by explaining the model of the self as found in classical pragmatism.
According to Fesmire, ‘mind is not an ontological space under the juris-
diction of free will’ (9); rather it is a function of ‘the doings and under-
goings of encultured, embodied, and historically situated organisms’ (9).
First, we are fundamentally social and cultural beings. Virtues are the
products of interaction between individuals and the social world; moral
character is ‘interwoven with one’s cultural horizon’ (12). We can and
do change our habits – customs are ‘evaluated and reconstructed in light
of circumstances’ (13) – but for Fesmire and his pragmatist predecessors
the weight is clearly on the social, cultural environment rather than on
the individual. In this view, customs possess us and not vice versa. If our
environment changes, different behavioural patterns, symbol systems,
stories, beliefs, myths, shared metaphors, virtues, and so on emerge.
Secondly, as cultural beings we are fundamentally embodied. The self
is not ‘an item in a container’ (9). Fesmire rejects using such a meta-
phor in this context. We are not a mind stuffed in a container, there
is no barrier between nature and culture. As Dewey had it, ‘biological
drives are transmuted by social life’ (23). To use the metaphor implied
in the phrase ‘raw, animal natures’ (23) – a metaphor that expresses
the nature–nurture dualism of his opponents – I suggest that Fesmire
thinks that our desires are not ‘raw’ basic biological drives, but are always
culturally ‘cooked’.

The implication of this view of the self is a rejection of views that
base morality on transcendental reason, ‘a non-social, emotion-free view
from nowhere’ (Fesmire 2003: 27). Kant made a distinction between
moral reasoning and prudential reasoning. Fesmire claims that all reas-
oning is prudential, that there is no such thing as ‘Reason itself’, that
reason is not separable from cultural, historical conditions and feelings.
Under changing conditions we are stimulated to readjust our habits.
Fesmire believes that the question for moral theory is not the search
for a bedrock such as universal laws of reason, principles, or divine
commands. Resisting what he calls the ‘siren lure to the hyper-rationalist
quest for the grand theory or meta-ethical principle that will systemat-
ically unify, without sacrificing robustness, competing ethical theories’
(57), he argues that there is a plurality of factors in moral situations
(as elsewhere, he follows Dewey here; see my discussion in the next
chapter). Principles, rules, and procedures are granted a role in moral
judgment and theory (58), but they cannot be defined in advance and
are summaries of moral wisdom that should not pretend to be more

than ‘guiding hypothesis that help open situations to inquiry’ (59).
They are to be tested. That
this
view of morality, while rejecting a ‘bedrock’, does not entail radical
relativism. Moral beliefs are hypothesis which can be confirmed or
falsified; moral reasoning is in that sense comparable with scientific
inquiry.

is why, according to Fesmire,

1.3.2. Against Kant
Given such a view of self and morality, it is unsurprising that Kant
is seen by the pragmatist defenders of ‘moral imagination’ as a main
opponent. Many of the arguments I summarised earlier are applicable,
or thought by Fesmire and Johnson to be applicable, to Kant. It is worth
looking at other arguments about and against Kant’s moral theory not
mentioned so far.

Johnson argues that a Kantian good will is not enough, we need
imagination to envision potential help and harm that may result from
our actions (see the consequentialist argument discussed in Section 1.2).
He also points out that we need imagination to interpret Kant’s categor-
ical imperative: ‘we cannot know what it means to treat someone as an
end-in-himself, in any concrete way, unless we can imagine his experi-
ence, feelings, plans, goals, and hopes’ (Johnson 1993: 200). I will take
up this argument in Chapter 7 (‘Kant and Kantians’) when discussing
interpretations of the categorical imperative.

Fesmire provides a more systematic criticism of Kantian moral theory.
He starts opposing Kant’s definition of imagination as a kind of thing:

The question What is the imagination? is loaded with the implication
that there is such a ready-made thing. Imagination is thus conceived
as an autonomous mental power – a primitive force instead of a func-
tion – whose task is to do specifiable things such as form images.
Such reification6 flowered in the faculty psychology of the eighteenth
century. Imagination’s job, the dominant story ran, is to synthesise
sensations from Perception into reproducible images (Kant’s repro-
ductive imagination) and relate them to the Understanding, which
classifies and schematises the images (what Kant called the productive
imagination) as instances of universal concepts (a process of judg-
ment). Understanding then passes these on to Reason, which decides,
perhaps consulting Memory, what to do about that matter. Reason
orders Will to attend to it, hopeful that Will is strong enough to
subdue the disruptions of Feeling. Imagination, on this view, is
usually a trusty crafter of images but is given to mischief. Thus Kant’s

Page-24

Contemporary Pragmatism 25

suspicion. Imagination as free reflective play is essential to aesthetic
judgment, for Kant, but in morals it is too self-indulgent. (Fesmire
2003: 61)

Fesmire claims that such a view of imagination has little relevance to
practical issues. He criticises contemporary philosophers who somehow
retain the Kantian split between self-contained faculties. Imagination,
then, is given a limited role in morality (he refers to Larmore, Hare, and
Werhane). Fesmire prefers Dewey’s view that imagination is an integral
part of human activity, including morality. Rather than proposing a
definition of imagination such as ‘the formation of mental images’ he
distinguishes two modes of imagination and their moral role empath-
etic projection and creatively tapping a situation’s possibilities (see
Section 1.2 above). Fesmire accuses Kant of conceiving empathy as
morally worthless since Kant would think that ‘it infuses feeling into
motives for action instead of subjecting oneself to the command of
reason alone’ (Fesmire 2003: 67). It may be the case that we are preju-
diced in favour of what or who is near and dear, but this is avoided if
empathy is accompanied by a wide survey of the situation. He concludes
that imagination is perhaps not sufficient but surely necessary to all
moral judgment.

Both Fesmire and Johnson argue that action is meaningless in isola-
tion, without context. They understand this to be an argument against
Kant, whose procedural and principled moral reasoning seems to be
a model for reasoning in isolation. Another argument related to their
stress on the social aspect of moral reasoning is that just following
formal rules is autistic rather than ideal. ‘If morality were reducible to
following rules or codes, high-functioning autism would be the moral
ideal’ (Fesmire 2003: 72), since the brains of autistic persons inhibit
normal empathy. If Kant’s moral theory does not rely on empathy at all,
but stresses following rules, it seems that it is close to such an autistic
‘ideal’. Moral imagination, on the contrary, is social since it allows us
to grow together: ‘Moral imagination can be artfully developed only
through a socially responsive imagination that skilfully perceives paths
of mutual growth’ (Fesmire 2003: 126). According to him this implies
that calculation and disengaged judgment are not responsible enough
(Fesmire 2003: 129).

1.3.3. Morality as art: the moral imagination revolution
How far does Fesmire stretch the metaphor of morality as art? His view
should not be confused with what he calls ‘the familiar thesis that art

June 30, 2007 9:54

MAC/IAPS

Page-25

0230_55279X_05_cha01

26 Pragmatism and Technology

affects moral imagination’. If art really is a metaphor for morality, then
what are the consequences? Fesmire is careful enough to discuss simil-
arities as well as differences between art and morality.7 His proposal to
replace the metaphor of business transactions by the metaphor of art
is promising. Rather than focus on isolated actions of atomistic indi-
viduals, his view allows us to see ourselves as improvising stage players
with ‘interlocking’ (111) acts and stories, challenged to ‘respond to any
new feature that the scene brings forward’ (Nussbaum quoted by Fesmire
2003: 112), and ready to take on the role of others (Fesmire 2003: 112).
And contrary to moral theories that focus on rule-following, this concep-
tion of morality as art brings in the possibility for personal creativity,
while accommodating for the social and cultural dimension of our self-
hood and moral agency. Such a view draws our attention to the skills
we need to act morally. We need to be able to forecast responses of
others and to take into account the actual responses of our ‘audience’.
We get a picture of the moral life as a dynamic, ongoing exploration
of new possibilities, a continuous interaction and perhaps struggle with
new situations.

Johnson’s and Fesmire’s claims are revolutionary in the sense that
the normative aspect of their discussions of ‘moral imagination’ as a
descriptive theory of moral reasoning is not the desire and the proposal
merely to adapt existing ‘absolutist’ and ‘foundationalist’ theories. In
order to respond to the complexity of moral experience, they want to
reform prior theories in a more radical way by removing their absolutist
and foundationalist assumptions and by shifting their central focus to
imagination. Consider Fesmire’s thesis about the role of imagination in
moral deliberation:

[Imagination] is at the foreground of deliberation and so must be
central, not merely supplementary, to moral judgment and know-
ledge. Piecemeal adjustment to contemporary moral philosophies
cannot accommodate this. [ (cid:2) (cid:2) (cid:2) ] Yet a Copernican shift centring ethics
on imagination can accommodate what is of pragmatic worth in these
philosophies. (Fesmire 2003: 68)

Thus Fesmire neither rejects nor dismisses existing moral philosophies,
and he does not deny that principles play a role in moral deliberation –
to deny this would indeed be ‘preposterous’ (Fesmire 2003: 58). Rather
he admits that they are ‘often indispensable’ (58). His point is that rules
should be taken as guides, as tools ‘to be tested and confirmed’ (59).

June 30, 2007 9:54

Page-26

0230_55279X_05_cha01

Contemporary Pragmatism 27

The Copernican shift Fesmire proposes, then, is that imagination, not
principles, should occupy the centre of moral deliberation:

If there must be a central focus in ethical theorizing, as convention
dictates, we should consider imagination for this role, and not merely
as a minor supplement to a theory of rules. (Fesmire 2003: 60)

Although Fesmire suggests in this passage that to speak of a ‘centre’ in
relation to ethics is not the most creative or most appropriate way of
speaking – at one point he remarks that ‘there is no central component’
(60) and that a ‘Copernican revolution’ implies a fixed centre – he goes
on to defend a ‘Copernican shift’ (60) in conjunction with his claim that
‘imagination intervenes deeply in moral life’ (68). Is such a Copernican
shift necessary or desirable? The thesis of this book is that it is neither
necessary nor desirable, but that we should further explore the relation
between imagination and principles. I will argue that neither imagina-
tion nor principles must be ‘central’, but that both are equally neces-
sary and important. Fesmire’s imagination-centred pragmatism and the
principles-centred view he opposes share a centre-periphery schema. We
must move beyond this way of thinking. In the course of the book,
this claim will be given substance and argumental support. For now, I
conclude that we meet in contemporary pragmatist theory an attractive
view that opens up new possibilities for moral theory. The accounts of
‘moral imagination’ Johnson and Fesmire provide shed new light on
what it is to engage in moral reasoning. I will further discuss the implic-
ations for moral reasoning and theories of moral reasoning in the next
chapter.
