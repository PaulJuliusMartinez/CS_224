Manipulating the Mouse Embryo
A LaboratoryManual, SecondEdition
By Brigid Hogan, Vanderbilt University Medical School; Rosa Beddington, National Institute for Medical Research, London; Frank Costantini, Columbia University; Elizabeth Lacy, Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center
The 1986 publication of Manipulating the Mouse Embryo catalyzed the interaction between molecular biology and mammalian embryology. For the first time, detailed instructions on how to begin applying recombinant DNA technology to important questions about mammalian embryonic development were made available to a broad audience. The gathering pace of such studies in recent years has brought improvements to existing methods and fueled the creation of new and powerful technologies. The second edition of this classic manual has been completely revised and expanded to incorporate these advances. It contains new sections on the production and analysis of transgenic mice, the manipulation of preimplantation embryos to generate chimeras, the culture and manipulation of embryonic stem cells, including gene "knockouts," and techniques for visualizing genes, gene products, and specific cell types. As before, included with the protocols is a summary of current understanding of mouse development at a molecular level. In its new edition, this manual of proven distinction is again an authoritative and comprehensive source of technical guidance for experienced investigators and an essential resource for newcomers to mammalian genetics and embryology.

Targeted Mutagenesis in Mice: A Video Guide
By Roger A. Pedersen, University of California, San Francisco; Virginia Papaioannou, Columbia University; Alexandra Joyner, Mount Sinai Hospital and University of Toronto; Janet Rossant, Mount Sinai Hospital and University of Toronto
Embryonic stem (ES) cells are important vehicles for transfer of genes into mice. When combined with normal pre-implantation embryos and transferred to foster mothers, ES cells contribute to the development of many different tissues, including the germline. When these cells are genetically manipulated, this approach discloses much about the function of specific genes.
Detailed methods for using ES cells are described in the manual Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition (see left column).
l-his video guide provides step-by-step demonstrations of the following procedures required for making mutant mice.
Demonstration 1: Startingembryonicstem (ES)cell lines
