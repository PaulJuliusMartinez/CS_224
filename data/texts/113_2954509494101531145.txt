Myofiber size is dynamically regulated, increasing and decreasing depending on muscle use. Hypertrophy is defined by increases in myofiber cross-sectional area and mass as well as myofibrillar protein content. Myofibers contain many hundreds of nuclei each of which has a nuclear domain. A nuclear domain is the volume of cytoplasm within the myofiber regulated by the gene products of a single myonucleus. Skeletal muscle hypertrophy is accompanied by proportional increases in both myofiber volume and myonuclei such that the ratio of myonuclei /cytoplasm, or nuclear domain, remains relatively constant (23). As myonuclei are terminally differentiated, myonuclear addition during skeletal muscle hypertrophy is dependent upon activation of a local pool of quiescent muscle precursor cells. Satellite cells are located between the basal lamina and cell membrane of each myofiber. Satellite cells are also responsible for myonuclear addition during postnatal muscle growth and new myofiber formation during regeneration. Below we discuss the evidence that supports hypertrophy of myofibers is dependent upon satellite cell proliferation and fusion with myofibers. Central to our viewpoint is that muscle hypertrophy is a continuum characterized by different molecular phases. Early responses to hypertrophy include enhanced transcriptional and translational activities. This is followed by myonuclear addition in a satellite cell-dependent manner. As discussed below, the recruitment of myonuclei to growing myofibers occurs at later times after application of a hypertrophic stimulus and contributes to muscle growth at later phases. The temporal regulation of muscle hypertrophy is integral to our viewpoint on the role of satellite cells in hypertrophy.
Hypertrophic stimuli enhance satellite cell proliferation. Satellite cells reenter the cell cycle in response to various hypertrophic stimuli including synergist ablation (3, 24, 26), testosterone (25), clenbuterol (27), stretch overload (16, 30) and exercise (13, 15). This satellite cell activation occurs in both slow and fast muscles as well as in rodents, birds and humans. Enhanced satellite cell proliferation is observed as early as 1-2 days after application of a hypertrophic stimulus (24, 30) and continues up to 7 days at least (26). Thus, satellite cells begin to expand in number prior to significant increases in myofiber growth.
Inhibition of myonuclear addition prevents hypertrophy. To ablate satellite cells, local gamma irradiation of rodent hindlimbs is performed prior to application of a hypertrophic stimulus. Subsequently, either muscle mass or myofiber cross-sectional area is measured. Satellite cell

activity can be assessed in multiple ways including enumeration of satellite cell numbers, bromodeoxyuridine labeling, myoD expression and increases in myonuclear number. Although irradiated cell populations may undergo 1-3 additional cell divisions (29) irradiation may also inhibit satellite cell differentiation and fusion (8, 28). The DNA lesions induced by gamma irradiation may occur either in satellite cells themselves or in non-muscle cell types that may prevent these cells from secreting factors that regulate satellite cell activity. Key to the interpretation of any satellite cell ablation study is the use of an effective local method to prevent increases in myonuclear number. The drawback to using pharmacologic DNA synthesis inhibitors rather than irradiation is that these drugs are administered systemically with potential indirect effects on muscle growth and in addition may incompletely inhibit cell proliferation (7). Ablation of satellite cells and inhibition of myonuclear addition using gamma irradiation totally prevented hypertrophy in adult rodent EDL, soleus and plantaris muscles following synergist ablation (1, 20, 21) and in adult plantaris muscles subjected to voluntary running (15). In contrast, gamma irradiation decreased only 50% of the muscle hypertrophy in response to either IGF-1 gene delivery (2) or reloading after hindlimb suspension-induced atrophy (18). Thus, satellite cells are required for hypertrophy in response to various stimuli. Differing degrees of growth inhibition following irradiation indicate the cellular mechanisms regulating increases in myofiber size may differ depending on the hypertrophic stimulus. The relative importance of satellite cell activity vs. increased protein synthesis within myofibers may vary depending on the stimulus used to induce muscle growth.
Is gamma irradiation merely exerting a non-specific toxic effect on muscle growth? Attenuation of muscle growth is not likely due to a general toxic effect of gamma irradiation on skeletal muscle with the 1800-3000 rads used in the studies cited above. No adverse effects on myofiber permeability as measured by release of creatine kinase were observed with 1800 rads (9) indicating that the inhibition of muscle growth is not merely due to gross myofiber defects. Indeed, doses between 12,000 and 18,000 rads are required for myofiber damage and necrosis (14). Importantly, transcriptional and translational activities are sustained in irradiated muscle subjected to hypertrophic stimuli (1, 15, 20, 21). For example, adaptive changes in myosin heavy chain expression that occur in response to synergist ablation (1, 20, 21) or endurance exercise (15) occurred normally following irradiation. In addition, irradiation had no significant impact on the increase in CD31+ endothelial cells with endurance exercise suggesting that inhibition of angiogenesis did not contribute to the inhibition of muscle growth. Furthermore, myofiber cross-sectional area increased 50% at early stages of reloading in both control and irradiated soleus muscles after hindlimb suspension-induced atrophy (18). Thus, low doses of irradiation do not elicit widespread toxic effects on muscle tissue that would non-specifically inhibit myofiber growth.
Different molecular phases of myofiber growth are temporally regulated. The initial phase of myofiber hypertrophy is characterized by enhanced transcription and translation (4) leading to enhanced protein accretion and a small expansion of the myonuclear domain. In the later phase, fusion of satellite cells also occurs with growing myofibers to re-establish the ratio of DNA/cytoplasmic volume (22, 23). Thus, small increments in myofiber cross-sectional area and cytoplasmic volume can be supported by increased transcriptional and translational activity of myonuclei but a threshold or "myonuclear domain ceiling" exists such that further increases in myofiber cross-sectional area require myonuclear addition. Accordingly, satellite cell-

Page 3 of 12
independent and -dependent phases of myofiber growth occur as shown by analyzing irradiated soleus muscles at multiple time points after a growth stimulus (17). As distinct phases of muscle growth exist, multiple time points are necessary to conclusively determine the role of satellite cells in any hypertrophic model. Although some studies concluded that satellite cells are not required for hypertrophy (6, 7, 16) their analyses were limited only to early times points after the application of a growth stimulus.
What about human muscle hypertrophy? Mechanistic studies can only be performed in animal models where anti-proliferative treatments can be administered or in transgenic models displaying defects in satellite number or function. Thus, human studies are limited to demonstrating correlative changes in myonuclear number with increases in myofiber size (5, 11, 19, 25). Myofiber hypertrophy in humans independent of myonuclear addition (10, 12, 19) may be due to not having reached a set myonuclear domain ceiling. A theoretical myonuclear domain ceiling of ~2000 m2 has been recently proposed beyond which myonuclear addition occurs (19). In summary, we believe satellite cell myogenesis is necessary for muscle hypertrophy at later phases of growth to maintain a constant myonuclear domain.

Counterpoint: Satellite cell addition is not obligatory for skeletal muscle hypertrophy
John J. McCarthy and Karyn A. Esser

The stated point for this debate is that satellite cell addition is obligatory for skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The definition of the word "obligatory" is important for our argument and we interpret it to mean mandatory, necessary or essential. Thus, as the counterpoint to this position, we will provide evidence of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in the absence of satellite cell addition.
Our position, that skeletal muscle is capable of hypertrophy without the addition of satellite cells, is supported by a large number of studies investigating the effect of 2-adrenergic agonists, such as clenbuterol and cimaterol, on skeletal muscle mass (1, 3, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22-25, 29). These studies have been performed in a number of species, including mice, chicken, sheep,

Page 6 of 12
and have convincingly shown administration of 2-adrenergic agonists can induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in the absence of any increase in DNA content or increases in myonuclear number (1, 6, 8, 9, 15, 19, 20, 23, 25). Thus one can look at muscle mass/DNA, protein content/DNA or fiber diameter/DNA and the result for all of these variables is that there is a significant increase in the ratio following 2-adrenergic agonist treatment.
Early studies by Maltin and Delday (13) treated rats with clenbuterol and analyzed protein content, total DNA content and the number of myonuclei per fiber in the soleus muscle. They reported a 15% increase in protein content with no change in total DNA or myonuclear number/fiber. Rehfeldt et al., found that clenbuterol treatment in rats resulted in a 24-28% decrease in the ratio of nuclei/cytoplasmic in the EDL muscle (23). More recently, Sharma et al., reported that mice administered clenbuterol showed a 26% increase in muscle mass with no change in total DNA content (25). They also documented that clenbuterol treatment induced hypertrophy with increases in muscle fiber cross sectional area in both red (i.e. type I or IIA) and white (i.e. type IIX or IIB) fibers. Many of these studies have shown that while total DNA content does not increase with 2-adrenergic agonist treatment, there is a robust increase in total RNA and this likely reflects an increase in ribosomal RNA and protein synthetic capacity (5, 18). In fact, several studies have shown that rates of protein synthesis are increased in skeletal muscle while rates of degradation are decreased in response to 2-adrenergic agonist treatment (2, 7, 10, 12, 14, 19, 26). Collectively, these studies provide strong evidence that 2-adrenergic agonists promote skeletal muscle hypertrophy by enhancing protein synthesis with no requirement for the addition of satellite cells.
In addition to the pharmacological studies, contractile activity has also been shown to induce hypertrophy of skeletal muscle in the absence of increases in DNA content. In a series of studies by Wong and Booth (27, 28) skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to a controlled training paradigm was tested in both the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GTN) muscles of rats. The eccentrically loaded TA muscle exhibited a 30% increase in muscle mass and 28% increase in protein content with no change in total DNA per muscle. Curiously enough, the concentrically loaded GTN muscle did exhibit an increase in total DNA content with no significant change in mass or total protein after 10 weeks of training. Increases in total DNA and nuclear content without muscle growth have been documented previously in studies of skeletal muscle in response to low frequency chronic stimulation (16, 21). Thus these results from the trained GTN muscle add to the literature demonstrating that increases in DNA/nuclear content are not sufficient to induce skeletal muscle growth.
The other set of studies that argue for skeletal muscle growth in the absence of satellite cell addition are studies in which DNA replication was inhibited either pharmacologically or by irradiation. In these studies, the inhibition of DNA replication was not sufficient to prevent skeletal muscle growth. Fleckman et al., treated male Sprague Dawley rats with hydroxyurea and/or cytosine arabinoside to inhibit DNA synthesis following synergist ablation and found no difference in the magnitude of growth in the treated and untreated rats (4). They also demonstrated that the increase in muscle weight was the result of an increase in myofibrillar protein content. More recently, Lowe and Alway exposed Japanese quails to -irradiation prior to applying stretch overload to the Anterior Latissimus Dorsi (ALD) muscle (11). As reported in the paper, the ALD muscle in both the control and irradiated quails exhibited the same

Page 7 of 12
magnitude of growth with 100% increases in mass and protein content. In addition, the authors report that there was no increase in total DNA and no increase in BrdU incorporation in the hypertrophied ALD of the -irradiated quail. Zeman et al, (29) also found that -irradiation of the mdx mouse did not block growth of the EDL or gastrocnemius muscles in response to clenbuterol treatment. Thus, we feel that these studies provide an additional line of support for our position that skeletal muscle can hypertrophy in the absence of satellite cell proliferation and/or addition.
In summary, we have provided evidence from studies of pharmacological and contraction induced skeletal muscle growth in which satellite cell addition does not occur as measured by DNA content or nuclear number. We also present studies in which inhibition of satellite cell proliferation does not inhibit skeletal muscle growth. We believe that the evidence we provide clearly makes our argument that satellite cell addition is not obligatory for skeletal muscle growth.

We believe to critically evaluate the contribution of satellite cells to hypertrophy the following conditions need to be fulfilled: 1) analysis of a complete spectrum of timepoints (early and late) after application of a hypertrophic stimulus, 2) sufficiently large increases in myofiber crosssectional area or diameter; 3) enumeration of myonuclear number using a method to clearly delineate the sarcolemma, and 4) to show cause and effect rather than correlation, ablation of satellite cell activity. The papers cited by McCarthy and Esser in various models of hypertrophy fail to satisfy one or more of these criteria and therefore, do not provide conclusive evidence against the necessity for satellite cells in hypertrophy. For example, the vast majority of the clenbuterol literature only analyzes muscle weight and content of total protein, RNA and DNA. Muscle weight and total protein are non-specific measures including both muscle and nonmuscle components of the tissue. Total DNA is an inaccurate measure of myonuclei including fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, etc. Kim et al analyzed myonuclear number in response to

Page 10 of 12
clenbuterol but only at 14 days using inappropriate methods (3). In contrast, myonuclear number was appropriately analyzed in some studies (5, 6) but only at early timepoints before the myonuclear domain ceiling of the existing myonuclei was likely to be exceeded. The timepoints chosen for study in the synergist ablation (2) and stretch overload (4) studies were too early in the hypertrophic process for appropriate interpretations on the role of satellite cells. Not commented upon by McCarthy and Esser is that one of their cited studies (1) demonstrated preferential increments in DNA content rather than RNA or protein accretion during the later stages of cimaterol-induced hypertrophy thus suggesting a role for satellite cells. The limitations inherent in utilizing DNA content as a measure of satellite cells must be kept in mind though. In summary, we believe the evidence generated from various models of muscle growth in multiple species support our contention that muscle growth may be viewed as a continuum of temporally regulated responses. We believe that muscle growth consists of multiple phases including accelerated transcriptional and translational responses followed by satellite cell addition during the later stages of hypertrophy. Satellite cell addition is necessary only if a certain threshold myofiber size is reached.

One of the fundamental arguments O'Conner and Pavlath use to support their position for satellite cell addition is that skeletal muscle fibers maintain a relatively fixed myonuclear domain (MND) which is defined as the ratio of cytoplasmic volume per myonucleus (6). However, we believe that MND is not a strong rationale for satellite cell addition because the data supporting a relatively fixed MND are equivocal. For example, Aravamudan et al., reported a poor correlation between cross-sectional area and myonuclear number across all fiber types (r2 = 0.08 to 0.001) with MND values ranging 3-fold, from 12,000-35,000µm3/myonucleus (1). These findings confirm elegant work by Wada et al. (2002) in which MND values ranged 2-fold with atrophy, from 7000-14,000µm3/myonucleus (9). These are just two examples that demonstrate that MND cannot be assumed to be relatively fixed in skeletal muscle. Thus, we feel that MND is a weak foundation for arguing that satellite cell addition is required during hypertrophy.
The other set of data presented in support of a satellite cell requirement come from studies in which -irradiation was used as a method to inhibit satellite cell activity (6). While these studies have shown that -irradiation treatment can inhibit growth of skeletal muscle they do not provide sufficient data to conclude that the lack of growth is due to effects only on satellite cells. Our primary concern is that -irradiation is a very messy experimental intervention that is known to produce deleterious effects to all cell types through both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms (2-5). We are not aware of any studies, including the ones cited, that assess the potential contribution of the non-genomic effects such as mRNA:polysome interactions or free radical mediated mitochondrial disruptions (3, 4). In addition, O'Conner and Pavlath do not provide much evidence that the growth potential of skeletal muscle, following irradiation, is due to genomic effects specific to satellite cells only. They cite only one study that reported no change in a single marker of endothelial cells (CD31 staining) to argue that only the satellite cell population is impaired by irradiation (6). We feel that analysis of only one marker for one cell type is very limited and does not come close to demonstrating that satellite cells are the only cells within skeletal muscle that are affected by irradiation. Consideration of other cell types is important as recent studies have implicated the contribution of macrophages as well as endothelial cells to skeletal muscle growth (7, 8).
