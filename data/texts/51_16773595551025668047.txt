Personal exposures, indoor and outdoor concentrations, and questionnaire data were collected in three retirement center settings, supporting broader particulate matter ( PM ) - health studies of elderly populations. The studies varied geographically and temporally, with populations studied in Baltimore, MD in the summer of 1998, and Fresno, CA in the winter and spring of 1999. The sequential nature of the studies and the relatively rapid review of the mass concentration data after each segment provided the opportunity to modify the experimental designs, including the information collected from activity diary and baseline questionnaires and influencing factors ( e.g., heating, ventilation, and air - conditioning ( HVAC ) system operation, door and window openings, air exchange rate ) measurements. This paper highlights both PM2.5 and PM10 personal exposure data and interrelationships across the three retirement center settings, and identifies the most probable influencing factors. The current limited availability of questionnaire results, and chemical speciation data beyond mass concentration for these studies, provided only limited capability to estimate personal exposures from models and apportion the personal exposure collections to their sources. The mean personal PM2.5 exposures for the elderly in three retirement centers were found to be consistently higher than the paired apartment concentrations by 50% to 68%, even though different facility types and geographic locations were represented. Mean personal - to - outdoor ratios were found to 0.70, 0.82, and 1.10, and appeared to be influenced by the time doors and windows were open and aggressive particle removal by the HVAC systems. Essentially identical computed mean PM2.5 personal clouds of 3 g / m3 were determined for two of the studies. The proposed significant contributing factors to these personal clouds were resuspended particles from carpeting, collection of body dander and clothing fibers, personal proximity to open doors and windows, and elevated PM levels in nonapartment indoor microenvironments.

Introduction
Background The National Research Council ( NRC, 1998 ) reviewed the PM2.5 ambient air standard adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA ) ( USEPA, 1997 ) and recommended that further studies be conducted relating particulate matter (PM ) exposures to health consequences, especially for populations known to be at highest risk. In response to the NRC recommendations, the EPA instituted a multifaceted, PM -research program to developing a more thorough understanding of how sensitive subpopulations such as the elderly are exposed. As part of this program, three successive panel studies were conducted that included

PM personal exposure components for elderly populations, in parallel with assessments of selected health indicators. These studies incorporated design elements for population PM exposures that considered geographic location (East and West Coasts of the U.S. ), seasonality ( warm and cold weather ), longitudinal sampling schedules, and microenvironmental intercomparisons (parallel ambient, indoor, and personal measures ). The integrated design of these studies allowed both exposure and health components to be conducted reasonably independently, linked by the (confidential ) participant identification codes. Prompt gravimetric analyses and preliminary reviews of the mass concentration data between studies provided the opportunity to make adjustments and additions to the study designs to facilitate more robust data base development.
An important consideration in these studies was the focus on elderly retirement center settings, compared to studies conducted in individual private residences. Previously reported studies have addressed personal exposures for the general populations (e.g., Ozkaynak et al., 1996; Pellizzari

Rodes et al.

Personal PM exposures in retirement centers

et al., 1999 ), whereas more recent studies are addressing PM exposures for sensitive subpopulations thought to be at greatest risk (e.g., children by Rojas -Bracho et al., 1999; elderly by Bahadori, 1998 ). The present paper summarizes personal PM exposures for elderly residents living in retirement centers. While the elderly typically reside in private residences at retirement age, they become more likely to live in assisted -living retirement communities as they become older. From an exposure study point -of -view, the practical advantages to considering this housing scenario include a centralized pool of potential participants from which to obtain volunteers, and the ability of a single, nearby residential outdoor sampling location to spatially represent the ambient PM concentrations. In order to link PM exposures in retirement centers with those in private residences, it is prudent to collect supporting information to characterize the facility characteristics known to have a significant influence on the indoor PM microenvironmental concentrations.
Panel Study Designs Important focuses of the three exposure study designs discussed here were: (1 ) development of relationships of personal exposures with outdoor and indoor microenvironmental concentrations, ( 2) providing information to understand the differences between measured personal PM exposures, and those estimated based on a simple time weighted microenvironmental model, and (3 ) estimating the proportions of personal exposures attributed to aerosols of ambient origin. The latter objective is critical to understanding the relationships between personal exposures, influenced by both ambient and indoor air sources, and historical epidemiological associations reported between health indicators and fixed -location, ambient measurements. Two different facility styles were proposed for study ( high - rise and campus) , in two different U.S. locations ( Baltimore, MD and Fresno, CA ). Two seasons ( cold and warm weather ) were studied in Fresno. The specific experimental designs of each exposure study are reported in greater detail elsewhere ( see Evans et al., 2000; Williams et al., 2000a,b ) .
The general design for all exposure studies was to conduct sampling over 28- day periods, with concurrent personal, apartment, and residential outdoor sampling made on a Monday through Saturday basis. Only residential outdoor sampling was conducted on Sundays. The relationships between the residential outdoor sites and nearby, regional - scale ambient air monitoring locations are discussed elsewhere. Indoor apartment concentrations for each study participant were monitored daily ( except Sundays ), by placing a sampling system at a central location within each participant's apartment. Simultaneous PM2.5 and PM10 sampling was conducted in each apartment, along with

scheduled collocated duplicates to establish precision. A subset of participants were selected to carry personal monitors. In Baltimore, 20 participants wore the personal monitor every day, except Sundays, for 25 sampling days, providing a total of 289 personal exposure observations. In Fresno 1, a total of 5 participants wore personal monitors every day except Sunday for 12- day periods, providing a total of 56 personal exposures. In Fresno 2, 16 participants wore personal monitors every day except Sundays for 12 sampling days, providing 190 personal exposures. All three studies consisted of 28- day sampling periods to provide a longitudinal component for personal exposures.
Personal exposure, indoor and outdoor concentration, physical factor, and questionnaire data were collected in three retirement center settings in support of parallel PM health studies of elderly populations. While the overall objective of the broader studies was to define associations linking health indicators with PM concentrations, robust exposure components were included with each study scenario to understand how and why the PM personal exposures occurred for this population class. The sequential nature of the studies and the relatively rapid review of the mass concentration data after each segment provided the opportunity to modify the experimental designs, including the information collected from activity and baseline questionnaires and physical factor measurements [ primarily heating, ventilation, and air- conditioning ( HVAC ) system operations, door and window openings, and air exchange rates (AERs ) ]. Modest differences in available resources between studies were partially accommodated by adjustments in the total number of participants and/ or the number of longitudinal sampling days for each participant.
The three retirement center studies varied geographically and temporally, with elderly populations studied in Baltimore in the summer (Jul / Aug ) of 1998, and Fresno in both the winter (Feb Ð designated Fresno 1) and spring /summer ( Apr /May Ð designated Fresno 2 ) of 1999. All the Baltimore study participants were housed in a single 18 -story high -rise building, whereas the participants of both Fresno studies (conducted in the same setting ) lived in detached apartment clusters in a campus -like setting. The Baltimore facility incorporated dining and recreation centers within the single structure, whereas the Fresno campus utilized separate buildings for these facilities. This affected activity patterns, in that the Baltimore residents did not have to leave the building, and thus were potentially less exposed to ambient aerosol.
The HVAC operations in the Baltimore facility were accomplished by (a ) a separate commercial system for all the common areas ( hallways, dining hall, etc. ), and ( b) individual apartment HVAC units providing individual apartment heating and air conditioning. The Fresno facility was conditioned by commercial units for the common areas (e.g., dining facility ), with small residential units for each

apartment. Another significant difference between facilities was the outside location of the individual apartment HVAC units in Fresno, such that accidental in - leakage on the suction side of these outdoor units provided an unplanned ingress for ambient air to move indoors.
This paper is the first of an expected series of papers addressing the personal exposure components of these rich data bases. The specific objectives of this paper are to ( a) briefly describe the personal exposure methodologies, ( b) describe the elements of the three panel studies expected to influence personal exposure relationships, (c ) present personal exposure measurements summaries that intercompare the three studies, (d ) discuss personal exposure relationships between microenvironmental scenarios (e.g., personal - to -outdoors, and personal -to - apartment ratios) , ( e) provide recommendations for additional work, and (f) summarize the key findings. Some of the data presented are noted as preliminary estimates, since the data bases for these studies are still under development, especially the compilation of the participant questionnaires and the subsequent chemical analyses of the integrated samples.

Experimental methods

Personal Exposure PM Sampling The primary 24 -h integrated measurement system for size specific aerosol sampling in all three studies was a miniature, battery - powered package developed by the Research Triangle Institute for PM -exposure studies. The system utilized 2.0 - and 4.0 -lpm personal exposure monitor (PEM ) model 200 inlets manufactured by MSP ( Minneapolis, MN ) to provide size - specific collections for PM2.5 and PM10. The shape of the PM2.5 cutpoint curve for the PEM inlets had been demonstrated (see Figure 1) to be virtually identical to that required by EPA for the FRM sampler. Note that an upstream pre -stage was included with the PM2.5 impactor to minimize potential overloading problems if high concentrations ( e.g., from ETS exposures) were encountered. The balance of the integrated sampling system was developed at the Research Triangle Institute ( RTI ) to provide controlled flow from 1.5 to 4.5 lpm (  5% ) and a record of key quality control parameters (e.g., pressure drop across the filter, inlet air temperature, battery voltage) in an extremely low -physical -burden package. Also collected, but not reported here, were data from a capacitance - based personal activity level sensor ( patent pending ) that senses the motion of the sampling system relative to the participant's body. This allows both an indication of the participant's activity level, as well as the degree of compliance with the monitor- wearing protocol. The system performance data are can be recorded for periods up to 168 h and are accessible via an RS -232 connection to a computer.

Figure 1. Comparison of 2.0 - lpm MSP Model 200 PEM inlet performance with the EPA FRM for PM2.5.
Key sampling system performance parameters include: (a ) sampling times up to 168 h with one set of four AA alkaline batteries, ( b) an unobtrusive package weighing only 900 g and having a noise level of < 40 dBA at 1 m, and (c ) an assortment of system housing types to allow personal exposure with the inlet at either waist or breathing -zone level, indoor, fixed -location sampling allowing one to three simultaneous, parallel channels, and an outdoor rain shield and support stand for either rooftop or backyard sampling. Outdoor, 24 -h concentrations were also measured using an EPA federal reference method ( FRM ) PM2.5 sampler to establish the accuracy of the residential PEM -based outdoor samplers.
The personal sampler version used in these studies for elderly participants was designed around a cotton vest, with the inlet located near the breathing zone, and the pump, data logger, and battery pack located in the pockets at the waist (see Figure 2 ). The vest was exchanged each day with study participant between 8 and 9 AM, to provide 24- h integrated collections. This period was consistent with the health indicator measurements for the participants.
Initial and final flow checks were made with a calibrated orifice that attached to the face of the MSP size -selective inlets. Postsampling performance data were downloaded for every collected personal exposure sample and reviewed as

part of the sample validation process. The Baltimore and Fresno 1 personal exposure collections were PM2.5, whereas Fresno 2 24 -h sampling periods were alternated daily between PM2.5 and PM10. This alternating - day sampling approach was necessary because the burden imposed by the dual - channel version of the personal sampler (1800 g) was considered excessive for the elderly participants. Indoor sampling was conducted in an unoccupied apartment in each retirement center (designated the in -central site ) to provide a relatively consistent indoor measurement with no windows or doors opened for extended periods (more than a few minutes ) at any time. Apartment indoor sampling was also conducted for each participant at a centralized location (the primary living area ) for PM2.5 and PM10, concurrent with the personal exposures. Residential outdoor sampling was conducted at one location at each facility to represent the atmospheric concentrations to which the facilities were ``exposed.'' The residential outdoor site for Baltimore was a 3rd floor roof of a building immediately adjacent to the participant's high - rise structure. The outdoor site for both Fresno studies was immediately outside the in - central apartment in the adjacent yard, with inlets elevated to 2 m about ground level. Outdoor sampling was also concurrently conducted with the personal exposure for both PM2.5 and PM10.
All filter -collection substrates were 37 mm diameter, 3 m porosity Gelman Teflo1 filters, which were pre - and postweighed after conditioning, using a Mettler AT20 microbalance. The balance was located in a constant temperature (  18C ) and relative humidity (  5% ) chamber. Filters were hand- carried to the laboratory from the field -sampling locations, Important considerations during the gravimetric analysis procedures were described by

Lawless and Rodes ( 1999 ). The precisions ( standard deviations ) of the 20th filter reweights were found to be better than  2 g for all gravimetric analyses. Evans et al. (2000) , reported a method detection limit ( MDL ) of 1.4 g/m3, and a mean standard deviation for collocated apartment sampling of 2.3 g/ m3 for these systems. The identical samplers and analytical procedures were also used to assess personal exposures using a vest, suggesting that the same MDL would apply. Although not specifically determined for these studies, personal exposure precisions (based on unpublished RTI data ) could be expected to be approximately 25% to 50% poorer than fixed location measures, or $2.9 to 3.5 g / m3.
Air Exchange Rates AERs were measured during Fresno 2 (only ) in two ways: integrated over 24 h in parallel with each apartment sample using both perfluorocarbon tracers ( PFTs) and CO release/ decay methodologies. The PFT sources were located through each participant's apartment in sufficient numbers (typical 2 to 4 ) to provide adequate concentration levels for acceptable precision. The collection tubes were located on the sampling cart, adjacent to the aerosol -sampling inlets. The PFT tube analyses and data reductions were performed by Brookhaven National Laboratories (Upton, NY ) following the methodology of Dietz et al. (1986 ). Controlled experiments were conducted in selected apartments using CO releases ( 5 ppm compressed cylinder mixture ), compartmental fan mixing, monitoring ( unoccupied spaces ) using calibrated CO monitors, and exponential decay regression fitting. The CO decay rates were typically monitored computing 1- min averages for 10- to 60 -min periods, depending on how rapidly the decay process occurred.

HVAC System Characterization The particle -removal capabilities of the HVAC systems and their influence on microenvironmental concentrations were recognized upon reviewing the lower- than - expected indoor ±outdoor concentration data from Baltimore apartments. Although resources were not available to return to Baltimore to study the HVAC system performance, several tests of the system performance were incorporated into the Fresno studies. The first was an assessment of the system flowrate to determine the number of apartment air volumes processed per hour. The total volumetric flowrate was determined by first mapping the velocity grid on an equal area basis at the face of the system cold air return plenum, using an anemometer probe. The mean volumetric flow was then computed based on the area -averaged face velocities. Similarly, the volumetric flowrate of the bathroom exhaust fan was determined using the same vent area mapping approach.
The duty cycle (fraction of time ON ) of selected HVAC systems was determined by using a miniature thermistor data logger (Smart Reader, ACR Systems, Surrey, British Columbia ) monitoring the HVAC vent output air temperature. As the system cycled ON and OFF, the temperature recording over the 24- h sampling period could be evaluated for the fraction of time in the ``shifted'' state (low for air conditioning, high for heating ).
The performance of the particle filter in the HVAC systems can have a substantial effect on the indoor microenvironmental PM levels, if either the particle removal performance of the filter is elevated, or the volumetric flowrate of the system is large, relative to the apartment volume. The performance of both clean (unexposed ) and dirty ( in place for 7 days ) filters was determined as a function of particle size at RTI using the procedure of Hanley et al. ( 1994 ) .
Questionnaires /Activity Diaries Information was collected for each 24 -h exposure from self - reported baseline questionnaires and activity diaries developed by the National Exposure Research Laboratory at EPA and completed by each participant. The short, 10 question baseline questionnaires addressed the sources

and situations expected to be most significant in potentially elevating PM exposures. Specific categories addressed included: number of apartment residents, type and duration of cooking and cleaning, presence of candles or incense, whether air cleaners were used, number of hours doors and windows were open, and duration of ETS exposure. A simple, two -page, self -reported activity diary was used to indicate the time - of- day and duration that the participant was in selected microenvironments. The time resolution was 15 min. The specific microenvironments included: indoor at home, outdoor at home, indoor away from home, outdoor away from home, at work, and in - transit.
Results
PM Concentration Relationships Understanding differences in PM exposures, concentrations and microenvironmental ratios requires concurrent consideration of the influencing factors, and their relative importance across studies, microenvironments, and particle size. Some of the most important factors affecting personal exposures to PM are the microenvironmental concentrations, the time spent in each microenvironment, the presence of and proximity to localized sources, the ability of outdoor particles to penetrate indoors, and the propensity for clothing fibers and body dander to be sampled. Indoor microenvironmental concentration are influenced by several processes, including: local particle generation from personal activity sources ( e.g., cooking, resuspension from carpeting ) ; relatively rapid particle -removal mechanism (e.g., HVAC filtration, air cleaners ); and relatively slow particle removal mechanisms (e.g., settling, surface deposition). The outdoor microenvironment provides concentration levels and particle -size distributions, depending on consistent sources (e.g., gasoline and diesel vehicles, power plants ), seasonal sources (e.g., wood stoves ), and seasonal meteorology changes that can affect local source dilution and influence long - range transport.

The personal exposure, apartment, and residential out-
door concentrations means and standard deviations across
all three panel studies are shown in Table 1 for both PM2.5 and PM10. Detailed plots of daily PM concentrations are given elsewhere by Williams et al. ( 2000b ) for Baltimore
and Evans et al. (2000 ) for the two Fresno studies.
Although the number of personal exposure observations for
Fresno 1 is significantly smaller than the other two studies,
the mean personal PM2.5 concentrations are very similar, ranging from 11.1 to 13.3 g / m3. The consistency of
concentrations across studies is also reflected in the
participant apartment means, which range from 8.0 to 10.5 g/m3. Participants in Fresno 2 had the smallest
standard deviation for both personal exposure and apart-
ment concentrations. The outdoor PM2.5 concentration means were very similar for Baltimore and Fresno 1, at 20.5 and 22.0 g / m3, but $50% lower in Fresno 2 at only 10.1 g/ m3. Again, the Fresno 2 data exhibited a
significantly smaller variability about the population mean.
The consistent mean personal exposures and apartment
concentrations for all three studies, despite the $50%
decrease in outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in Fresno 2 was somewhat surprising, given the variations in geographic
locations and seasons. Baltimore and Fresno 1 personal and
apartment PM2.5 data were undoubtedly similar because of the coincidentally similar outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in both locations and apparently similar air exchange and
particle loss rates. The windows in Baltimore (high - rise
facility; Summer season ) and in Fresno 1 (apartment

facility; Winter season ) were rarely opened during these studies, providing similar AERs. The warmer temperatures in Fresno 2 ( compared to Fresno 1) and the observed more frequent openings of doors and windows in Fresno 2, produced similar personal, outdoor, and apartment concentrations. Supporting this observation is the significantly warmer mean daytime temperature in Fresno 2 of 19.48C during the April /May study period, compared to 11.18C during the February period for Fresno 1. To date, only the Fresno 2 baseline questionnaires have been completely reduced, indicating that the mean length of time for doors and window to be open was 5.1 h.
The mean personal exposure concentration for PM10 in Fresno 2 was 26 g / m3 higher than that for PM2.5. The apartment PM10 concentrations for all three studies were very similar, ranging from 13.5 to 16.7 g/ m3, as were the outdoor concentration, which ranged from 28.2 to 30.1 g / m3. Again, the variability about the means was by far the lowest for Fresno 2.
The PM2.5 / PM10 concentration ratios are given in Table 2 and show that the outdoor size fraction ratios were nearly identical in Baltimore and Fresno 1, but 50% lower in Fresno 2. This shift from Fresno 1 to Fresno 2 is consistent with Fresno historical data in which the outdoor ratio historically decreases from February to April /May, as the smaller particles produced from wood - stove operations in nearby neighborhoods ( the odor of wood smoke was often apparent in the neighborhood during Fresno 1 ) ceases during the warmer weather. The drier spring conditions also provide a significantly greater contribution of coarse dusts blown from the adjacent San Joaquin valley. The apartment PM2.5 / PM10 ratios were more consistent across studies, with Fresno 2 exhibiting a modest 10% to 20% lower ratio than Fresno 1. Compared with the ratio change that occurred simultaneously outdoors between sampling studies, this smaller change at first seems inconsistent with the apartment ratios. Note, however, that based on the mean PM2.5 concentration levels observed, that the 20% represented only $3 g / m3. At least two contributing processes must be considered: (1 ) the generation of particles that the participants produce from indoors personal activity sources, and (2 ) a potentially higher removal efficiency of the

HVAC system for larger particles. Both processes are discussed subsequently.
The microenvironmental ratios of apartment - to - outdoor concentrations are shown in Table 3 for both particle - size ranges, along with the ratios of personal -to - outdoor, and personal - to -apartment. The most striking feature of this table is the consistent ratio of personal exposure -to apartment concentrations across all three studies for PM2.5. The mean daily personal - to - apartment ratios are shown in Figure 3, with one standard deviation range bars for each day reflecting the variability across participants. Note also the consistent increase in apartment - to - outdoor and personal - to -outdoor ratios from Fresno 1 to Fresno 2 for PM2.5, consistent with more frequently opened doors and windows. Conversely, there was essentially no change observed for apartment - to - outdoor PM10 ratio, suggesting that this fraction does not penetrate through open doors and windows as readily, and /or the contribution from resuspension to PM10 indoors from personal activities is fairly consistent across seasons. Given the relative consistency of the apartment concentration across studies shown in Table 1 and the somewhat variable outdoor concentration, these PM2.5 ratios suggest a fairly consistent personal cloud.
The mean PM2.5 personal - to - outdoor ratios shown in Table 3 ranged from 0.70 in Baltimore to 1.1 in Fresno 2. The relatively consistent coefficients of variation about the means for Baltimore and Fresno 2 of 11% and 13% suggest that these two measures must be reasonably well correlated. To provide more detail as to the temporal variability of these

residential outdoor concentrations for one of the participants is shown in Figure 5, and shows a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78. The mean correlation coefficient for all participant - days in Fresno 2 was 0.80. These data could be compared with the data of Rojas - Bracho et al. ( 1999 ) , who found a longitudinal correlation coefficient of 0.60 for 18 COPD patients. Interestingly, the 3.4 g / m3 intercept of the regression in Figure 5 is coincidentally consistent with the $3 g/m3 personal cloud value estimated previously for all participants, even though the intercept is not statistically different from zero.
Personal Cloud Computations The potential influence of a personal cloud (PC ) on exposure estimates was suggested by Rodes et al. (1991) . It is computed as the increase in particle mass collected by a personal exposure sampler, over and beyond that estimated from a simple time - weighted compartmental average, utilizing the self -reported, activity diary information. The average utilizes the apartment concentration as the applicable concentration for all indoor microenvironments, whether at home or away. Positive PC values indicate excess personal collections for ( either PM2.5 or PM10 ) from sources not significantly influencing the participant's apartment sample. Table 4 provides the computations for two of the three studies. Computations of the PC in Baltimore were conducted on an individual participant -day percent time and concentration basis, and then summarized into a composite mean. Only the first week of the laborious manual data reduction was accomplished, however, for the activity diaries for Fresno 2. The minimal variability in Fresno 2 personal exposure concentrations and the consistent daily temperatures across all days, suggested that a single week should be reasonably representative of the entire study period. Fresno 1 activity questionnaires have not yet been reduced. The simple PC computational model of Bahadori ( 1998 ) was used. The collection of both PM2.5 and PM10 personal exposures in Fresno 2 permitted computation of PCs for each size fraction.
As shown in Table 4, the PM2.5 PCs for the two studies were estimated to be virtually identical at 3 g/ m3. This value is consistent with the PC computed by Bahadori

(1998) for an elderly COPD study population. Wallace (2000) provides additional PC computations for other study populations. This supports the observation that even in substantially different facilities and over two seasons, elderly populations in both the East and West Coast retirement center settings had similar exposures and activity patterns. The more extensive Baltimore data showed that the mean PC has a relatively large coefficient of variation of 61% across all sampling days and participants. These mean daily PCs by participant in Baltimore ranged from À 2.5 to 6.5 g/ m3, with the negative result caused by the presence of apartment air cleaners. It is presumed that the magnitude of these PCs would be invariant with the outdoor PM2.5 concentration, but may be linked to particle size distribution, if penetration through the building shell (or open doors and windows) is particle - size dependent.
The estimated PM10 PC from Fresno 2 was 20 g / m3, which is significantly higher than the mean apartment concentration. By comparison, the PM2.5 PCs in Table 4 were only 1 /3 of the apartment means. Bahadori ( 1998 ) reported a PM10 PC of 11 g/ m3 that was characterized as representing a generally inactive population, with only 5% of their waking hours observed to be active. Nine of the ten residences in the Bahadori ( 1998 ) study were carpeted.
Facilities Characterizations AER data for specific scenarios were characterized by CO release/decay experiments (see Table 5) . These data show that a wide range of AER values are possible, depending on whether the HVAC unit was leaking, one or two outside doors were open, and whether the ambient wind speed was elevated when the doors were open. The mean 24 -h AER for all apartment samples collected was found to be 0.48 h À 1 ( SD 0.35 h À 1 ) , which is reasonably consistent with the CO decay data. The large change in AER when the door was open suggested that the baseline questionnaire category for the self - reported time doors and windows were open would be very helpful in understanding the influence of AER on indoor microenvironmental concentrations. This was found not to be the case, however, because the question lumped both door and window openings into the same question. Data reported by Wallace (1996 ) suggest that

these entry points for ambient aerosol can have significantly different influences on AER. The preliminary nature of the AER data analysis precluded an assessment as to its importance in understanding the indoor microenvironmental concentrations.
It was concluded from the substantial differences in AER that could occur from the OFF to the ON mode of the HVAC system (Table 5 ) that limited duty cycle information should also be obtained. The HVAC system in the heavily instrumented in -central apartment in Fresno 2 showed a duty cycle of 0.42 (ON 42% of the time) , primarily for the air- conditioning mode. This duty cycle was reduced from the Fresno 1 study of essentially unity, by moving many of the vacuum pumps outdoors to reduce the heat load. These in - central site duty cycles can be compared with the much smaller duty cycle of participant apartments of only 0.073 (  0.05 ).
Duty cycle is especially important in facilities that have high HVAC flowrates relative to the volume of the space. The measured volumetric flowrate in the Fresno in - central facility was 22 m3 / min for an apartment volume of 127 m3. This translated to 10.5 air changes per hour ( ACH ) though the HVAC filter. Even with relatively poor filtration efficiencies, such ACH values would be expected to have a significant impact on the apartment - to -outdoor ratio. The application of indoor air quality models to address the performance of the HVAC system on indoor compartmental concentrations are discussed by Thornburg et al. ( 1999 ) .
The particle collection efficiencies of the Fresno HVAC filters from 0.3 to 10 m is shown in Figure 6 for both clean and soiled substrates. All units in the retirement center complex used the same commercial filter material ( Mazler MZ -S, Los Angeles, CA ), which is described by the

manufacturer as being coated with a ``tackifier'' to improve particle collection. In general, the soiled filter removed 5 ± 10% more particles for a given particle size. A typical residential filter collection is shown for comparison to illustrate that the collections normally increase for particles smaller than 0.1 m. Although the Fresno filter collections are reasonably efficient for particle sizes above about 2 m, the efficiency is quite low for particle sizes less than 1 m. This observation may be important for aerosol constituents

typically found only in the size range below 0.5 m (e.g., ambient combustion aerosols ). A simple test to evaluate the added particle - removal efficiency imparted by other components in the HVAC system (e.g., duct work ) was accomplished by comparing the size distribution of particles entering the cold air return with an aerodynamic particle sizer, and comparing them with particle emitted at the outlet vents. These points plotted in Figure 6 suggest that the balance of the HVAC system contributes additional removal efficiency for particles above about 2 m.
Baseline Questionnaires The summary results from the Fresno 2 baseline questionnaires show that 55.2% of the 24- h exposures were influenced by some form of cooking. Cooking aerosol might be expected to be smaller than 2.5 m, depending on the type of cooking. A detailed breakdown of this category to distinguish subcategories (e.g., frying from microwave heating) has not been conducted. The overall results for the cleaning category showed that 18.2% of the sample periods incorporated some type of cleaning. Cleaning activities ( e.g., dusting, vacuuming ) might be expected to contribute particles larger than 2.5 m. There again may have been some confusion from the form of the question, because a number of the participants used a local cleaning service to clean their apartments while they were away (i.e., their personal exposure would have been unaffected ). Supplemental apartment air cleaning was used concurrent with 9.4% of the collected samples. The affected samples represented the exposures in only two apartments with air cleaners, however, one of which was apparently offset by a leaking dryer vent in the same apartment.
The baseline questionnaire was found to be very useful, but needed several wording refinements, as mentioned previously. The simple form of the activity diary was extremely well received by the study participants and required very little follow -up to obtain additional information. A serious drawback to the current forms is the lack of machine- readable formats, making data entry very laborious.
Discussion
The data from the Baltimore, Fresno 1, and Fresno 2 panel studies showed that the 24 - h personal and apartment PM2.5 concentrations for the elderly in retirement centers exhibited relatively consistent mean personal -to -apartment ratios, ranging from 1.50 to 1.68 for all study days ( see Figure 3). This consistency was surprising, given the differences in facilities and seasons across the three studies. It is important to recognize that these ratios were produced from measurements that differed by only $3 g/m3. Although the measurement methodologies were sufficiently precise to detect such differences, the ratios appear large because of

the relatively low apartment concentrations. The significantly reduced apartment concentrations appear to be the result of minimal PM2.5 indoor sources for these populations combined with relatively aggressive particle removal by the HVAC systems.
Computations of the PM2.5 PCs showed that the measured personal exposures for two of the three studies are 3 g/m3 higher than the personal exposures computed from simple time -weighted average microenvironmental concentrations. This value is consistent with the data of Bahadori ( 1998 ) who studied less active COPD patients in private residences. Although most of the residences reported by Bahadori (1998) had carpeting, it is not completely clear that the source contributions ( especially carpet PM resuspensions ) were similar to the more active panel studies populations reported here. While the PM2.5 PC value was only a fraction of the apartment concentrations, the PM10 PC was significantly higher than the mean apartment concentrations. This clearly highlights the predominant generation of larger particles during personal activities, and associated role of the relative proximities of the personal and apartment monitors to these sources. Patterson and Eatough ( 2000 ) similarly attributed unexpectedly large PM2.5 concentrations in a school study to human activity sources.
At least four contributing sources/scenarios can be proposed for the computed mean PCs for retirement center populations, estimated to essentially the same across the three studies. The most significant contributor to both PM2.5 and PM10 PC is thought to be particle resuspensions from walking on carpeting, which were found in all three retirement center apartments. Additional testing for carpet PM resuspension from walking events conducted previously by RTI showed PM2.5 room - averaged contributions ranging from 2.3 to 10.8 g / m3 in two private residences and 6.6 g/ m3 in a controlled laboratory experiment. The PM10 results for these tests were 56.4 to 66.7 g/m3 in the residences, and 87.8 g / m3 in the lab experiment. Controlled testing with the monitors within 1 m of the individual walking showed PM2.5 concentrations that were at least a factor of two greater than the room average values. This result suggests that a more realistic composite PM2.5 value in the range of a 13 g / m3 contribution may be reasonable while walking. Even though most of the panel study participants were in the ``unassisted living'' category, it is unlikely that they were active more than 10% of the time. Extrapolating this information, walking activities might have been expected to contribute approximately 1.3 g/ m3 to the 24- h concentrations, or approximately one - half of the measured PM2.5 PC. A second possible source of PC mass is from ``body cloud'' particles, contributed from dander and clothing fibers. Preliminary SEM observations from Fresno study filters (Conner, 1999 ) suggested that numerous clothing fibers, dander, and personal care particles in the 5 -m size range were observed on a subset of PM2.5 personal exposure filters. Assuming unit

density, spherical particles, and $200,000 particles /filter ( conservatively consistent with the numbers of dander particles found on the PTEAM personal exposure filters ) a contributed mass concentration from these particles of $1.1 g/ m3 is computed.
A third possible contributor to the PC is proximity of the participant to the plume of ambient aerosol convectively transported indoors through open doors and windows. The presumption is that in some cases the personal monitor may be significantly closer to this source than the fixed - location apartment monitor. For example, it was observed from the Fresno 2 participant interview responses that occasionally bedroom windows were left open during sleeping periods. In this situation, a personal monitor within 1± 2 m of the open window might be influenced by the plume of typically higher outdoor concentration for the sleeping period. Using a recently developed personal exposure model ( Rodes et al., 2000 ), the potential contribution of open doors and windows was estimated. The Fresno 2 baseline questionnaires provided the number of hours doors and windows were open in each apartment. Then assuming that the personal monitor was twice as close as the apartment sampler, the contribution from open doors and windows to the personal PM2.5 exposures was estimated to be 1.4 ( SD 1.0 ) g/ m3. This would readily explain the balance of the 3 g/ m3 Fresno 2 PC, not explained by resuspension and body dander. The comparatively large standard deviation for this estimate suggests that it contains a fairly large degree of uncertainty. The comparable computed Fresno 2 contribution for PM10 by the model was 3.8 ( SD 2.3) g / m3.
The fourth suggested contributor to the computed PC is the possibly increased (or decreased ) indoor compartmental concentrations in microenvironments other than the participants' apartments. These other microenvironmental concentrations were not characterized in any of the panel studies. The mean percentage of time spent indoors away from their apartment in Baltimore was 16%, with 5% indicated as the facility dining area (contained within the building complex ) . Elevated PM2.5 aerosol contributions from cooking could readily have increased the indoor contributions significantly. The mean percentage of time spent indoors away from the Fresno 2 apartments was a similar 18%, with an outside traverse time required in each visit. This could also be important, in that the outdoor times less than 15 min were typically not indicated on the questionnaire. On the assumption that the Baltimore dining area PM2.5 concentration was twice that of the participant's apartment, this would have meant an additional computed contribution of $0.5 g/ m3. This assumption is reasonable compared with the 7 g/ m3 increase in respirable particle concentrations from cooking reported by Morandi et al. (1988 ).
The mean personal -to -outdoor ratios range from 0.70 in Baltimore and 0.82 in Fresno 1, to 1.10 in Fresno 2. The

relatively large variability for Fresno 1 (see Table 3) resulted from the limited number of personal exposure measurements made each day (two or three ), compared to the other studies. The current data analysis suggests no difference between the mean personal - to -outdoor ratios for Baltimore and Fresno 1. By comparison, this ratio for Fresno 2 is much closer to unity, suggesting a less aggressive HVAC operation ( lower duty cycle ) during the warmer Fresno 2, combined with a more probable greater frequency and duration of open doors and windows. The 1 g/m3 difference between mean personal exposure and mean residential outdoor concentration, compared with the computed mean PC of 3 g/m3, would suggest that at least some portion of the PC is actually particles of ambient origin. This would bolster the suggestion that proximity of the participants to ambient aerosol convectively penetrating open doors and windows was a viable contributor to the personal exposures in Fresno 2.
Although the number of personal exposures supposedly influenced to some degree by cooking was 55%, further review of the self -reported baseline questionnaires may show that much of the cooking was incidental heating ( often microwave ) that probably produced few particles. This is partially the result of some of the participants choosing to either eat off-campus or eat in the (separate ) dining facilities provided by the retirement centers. Similarly, many residents in the Fresno facility utilized cleaning services, who often functioned when the participant was not at home. The complete absence of ETS exposures in these elderly populations, combined with only modest cooking and cleaning, should result in a simpler scenario from which to estimate the contributions of aerosols of ambient origin to the measured personal exposures. In the absence of supporting chemical analysis results from subsequent sample analyses (currently in progress ), an apportionment of the personal sample collections is not realistically possible.
The role of the HVAC systems in reducing the apartment concentration in the two retirement center facilities used in the three panel studies was found to be extremely important. This was partially due (at least in Fresno ) to the relatively high system flow rates, resulting in over 10 ACH during periods when the HVAC system was operational. Even with an apartment duty cycle of only about 7%, the HVAC operation significantly altered the apartment - to -outdoor ratio, and thus the personal exposure levels. Additionally, collecting these characterization data will make it impossible to subsequently relate the data from these commercial facilities with studies of single -family residences.
Conclusions
The reduction in PM2.5 to PM10 ratio from 0.73 in the Fresno 1 study to 0.36 in Fresno 2 study resulted in part

from (a ) the influence of wood smoke present in the Fresno 1 Winter period (mostly particles < 2.5 m ) , but not present during the warmer temperatures observed during Fresno 2, and (b ) the additional coarse particles ( > 2.5 m ) produced by the higher windspeeds in Fresno during the Spring. The indoor PM2.5 to PM10 ratios for these studies showed a more modest change from 0.61 to 0.51 from the Winter to the Spring season, tempered primarily by the additional coarse particles generated during both seasons by indoor activities.
The PM measurement methodologies were found to be sufficiently precise to quantify the relatively low PM2.5 personal exposures and compartmental average concentrations found in all three panel studies. This was important to allow an assessment of the factors possibly contributing to the consistent, but small, 3 g / m3 mean PCs computed for all studies for PM2.5. The associated methodologies used in the Fresno 2 study to characterize the facility (AER ) and the HVAC system (filtration efficiency, AER, duty cycle ) also provided extremely useful information, especially for subsequent modeling studies. The baseline questionnaire was found to be very useful, but needed several wording refinements. The simple form of the activity diary was extremely well received by the study participants and required very little follow -up to obtain additional information. Automating the questionnaire data entry process is currently under study.
The rapid gravimetric analysis of samples and preliminary data analyses between each study provided the ability to modify the study designs ( within the available resources ) to maximize the predictive power of the integrated data bases. This ``lessons learned'' approach resulted in the Fresno 2 study incorporating the highest quality and most refined study design. Some of these lessons included: ( a) covering the carpeting in the indoor work areas to minimize particle resuspension from study technician activities from biasing PM collections, ( b) identification of specific apartment HVAC system leaks that dramatically affected the integrated AER data, and (c ) characterizing the efficiencies of the HVAC filters and recording the percentage of time the systems were operating to permit more accurate subsequent compartmental modeling.
Understanding the factors that influence personal exposures (and the computed PCs ) is key to reducing the uncertainties in relating PM exposures resulting from selected source categories to health indicators. The relatively low concentration levels found indoors at the retirement centers studied demonstrated that the exposure levels for these populations may be significantly lower than the concentration levels measured at outdoor fixed locations. This was attributed to the minimal number of indoor sources generating PM, and the effective removal by the HVAC systems. The reasonably strong correlations, however, from the preliminary longitudinal analyses between residential outdoor concentrations and personal exposures

for PM2.5 are consistent with other reported panel studies. This correlation supports the observation that a substantial portion of the PM2.5 exposures for retirement center residents are particles of ambient origin that penetrate indoors. Subsequent source apportionment analyses of th the chemical speciation should provide a stronger basis for this conjecture.
Four potential contributors to the computed PM PCs were discussed, including carpet dust resuspension, body dander /fibers collection, personal proximity to open door and windows, and high concentrations in nonresidential, indoor microenvironments. While these component contributions to the computed PC means should prove useful, the greater challenge is predicting the sources and scenarios that explain the wide range of daily PCs by participants. Understanding the factors that influence PM2.5 and PM10 PCs and the proportions of the personal exposures composed of aerosol of ambient origin will be addressed in a subsequent paper.
Several additional improvements to the measurement and data - collection methodologies are still needed to address basic questions. The important issue of quantifying the contribution of particles of ambient origin to exposure samples, still needs improvements in both measurement and modeling capabilities. The current inability to collect simultaneous multichannel PM personal exposure samples in an unobtrusive manner restricts collection of multiple size fractions or simultaneous collections on different substrates. This greatly hampers the ability to conduct personal exposure source apportionments. The obtrusiveness of multichannel systems for assessing exposures for both the elderly and children limits their applications to only the more physically capable individuals. The ability to automate questionnaire data entry procedures will also greatly facilitate data base development and validation.
