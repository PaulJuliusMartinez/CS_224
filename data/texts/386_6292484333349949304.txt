Abstract In this paper, we present a lexical resource where WordNet synsets are annotated with Subject Field Codes. We discuss both the methodological issues we dealt with and the annotation techniques used. A quantitative analysis of the resource coverage, as well as a qualitative evaluation of the proposed annotations, are reported.

1. Introduction
Subject Field Codes (SFC) are sets of relevant words for a specific domain. The best approssimation of SFCs are the field labels used in dictionaries (e.g. MEDICINE, ARCHITECTURE), even if their use is restricted to word usages belonging to specific terminological domains. In WordNet, too, SFCs seem to be used occasionally and without a consistent design.
SFCs are considered a crucial information for a general purpose lexical resource (e.g. the "domain ontology" in the Eurowordnet model) and for many NLP tasks such as in Information Retrieval (IR), Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Text Classification. In IR, SFCs are used to expand a query and "the target" (usually keywords) to include more words in the intersection in order to improve both recall and precision ((Liddy and Paik, 1993) and (Schutze, 1998)). WSD tasks usually compare the possible semantic fields of the ambiguous word with the context of the word in order to identify the most correct senses ((Gythrie et al., 1991), (Yarowsky, 1993), (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998) and (Gonzalo et al., 1998)). Text Classification processes determine the subject area of a text searching for keywords. Because texts may use synonyms or refer to concepts, SFCs may increase the effectiveness of the research by keywords (Walker and Amsler, 1986).
Some NLP works use SFCs derived from pre-existent lexical resources, such as WordNet semantic files (Agirre et al., to appear), the WordNet hierarchy (Hearst and Schutze, 1996) and LDOCE field labels ( (Walker and Amsler, 1986), (Gythrie et al., 1991), (Liddy and Paik, 1993) (Wilks and Stevenson, 1998)). But because they are not consistent and complete, in the last years SFCs repertories have been automatically developed. In (Veronis and Ide, 1990), SFCs are automatically derived from MRD definitions using neural networks; in (Dyvik, 1998) SFCs are derived from a multilingual corpus. Some other works such as (Schutze, 1992), (Hearst and Schutze, 1996), (Leacock et al., 1996) and (Schutze, 1998) extract SFCs from corpora using cooccurrence statistical methods.
In this paper, we present a lexical resource where WordNet synsets are annotated with SFCs by a semiautomatic procedure which exploits WordNet structure. The decision to annotate WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) synsets with SFCs

is motivated in several respects: (i) SFCs provide crosscategorial information, which is almost completely absent in WordNet; (ii) synsets are the appropriate semantic level for SFC annotation, abstracting from the word level; (iii) as we consider SFCs to be basically language independent, we envisage an important role for them in multilingual wordnet-like resources, such EuroWordNet and MultiWordNet (Artale et al., 1998).
The paper is organized as follow: the SFCs organization is described in 2. while in 3. the procedure for the annotation of the synsets with the appropriate SFCs is described. In 4. and 5. we point out some results and the evaluation process we have used to check the SFCs we have produced.
2. Subject Field Codes organization
Information brought by SFCs is complementary to what is already in WordNet. First of all a SFC may include synsets of different syntactic categories: for instance MEDICINE1 groups together senses from Nouns, such as doctor#1 and hospital#1, and from Verbs such as operate#7.
Second, a SFC may also contain senses from different WordNet sub-hierarchies (i.e. deriving from different "unique beginners" or from different "lexicographer files"). For example, the SPORT SFC contains senses such as athlete#1, deriving from life form#1, game equipment#1, from physical object#1 sport#1 from act#2, and playing field#1, from location#1.
We started deriving a list of about 250 subject field codes from a number of paper and machine readable dictionaries. Then the list has been enriched on the base of the Dewey Decimal Classification (Diekema, 1998), and then structured along two dimensions: inclusion, resulting in a SFC hierarchy, and semantic proximity, resulting in a number of SFC families.
2.1. SFC Hierarchy
As for the hierarchical organization, each level is made up of codes of the same degree of specificity: for example the second level includes SFCs such as BOTANY,
1Throughout the paper subject field codes are indicated with this TYPEFACE while word senses are reported with this typeface#1, with their corresponding numbering in WordNet 1.6.

Figure 1: SFC hierarchy fragment.

LINGUISTICS, HISTORY, SPORT and RELIGION, while at the third level we can find specializations such as AMERICAN HISTORY, GRAMMAR, PHONETICS and TENNIS. Figure 1 shows a fragment of the SFC hierarchy.
2.2. SFC Families
In addition to the hierarchical structure, SFCs are organized into families. A family is a group of semantically close SFCs among which there is no inclusion relation. Whereas we consider the hierarchy as a fixed organization, families can be flexibly rearranged, allowing the creation of new interdisciplinary and application dependent
fcodes. As an example, a family such as SPORT MEDICINE gANATOMY imposes a particular user's point of view over
the SFC organization.
2.3. Factotum and Generics
There are a number of WordNet synsets that do not belong to a specific SFC, but rather they can appear in almost all of them. For this reason, a FACTOTUM SFC has been created which basically includes two types of synsets:
Generic synsets, which are hard to classify in a particular SFC, such as:
man#1 an adult male person (as opposed to a woman) man#3 the generic use of the word to refer to any human being date#1 day of the month date#3 appointment, engagement

Stop Senses synsets which appear frequently in different contexts, such as numbers, week days, colors, etc. These synsets usually belong to non polysemous words and they behaves much as stop words, because they do not significantly contribute to the overall sense of a text.
We have identified 2780 stop senses and 3670 generics in Wordnet 1.6, which results in 6450 synsets belonging to the FACTOTUM SFC.
3. Annotation procedure on WordNet 1.6
The procedure for the annotation of the synsets with SFCs iterates three steps. First, a small number of high level synsets are manually annotated with their pertinent SFCs. Then, an automatic procedure exploits some of the WordNet relations (i.e. hyponymy, troponymy, meronymy, antonymy and pertain-to) to extend the manual assignments to all the reachable synsets. As an example, this inheritance-based procedure allows to automatically mark
f gthe synset beak, bill, neb, nib with the code ZOOLOGY, f gstarting from the synset bird and following a "part-of"
relation. There are cases in which the inheritance procedure has to be blocked, inserting an "exception", to prevent a wrong propagation. For instance, barber chair#1, being a "part-of" barbershop#1, which in turn is annotated with COMMERCE, would wrongly inherit the same SFC. To deal with these cases, the inheritance procedure allows the declaration of exceptions, such as:

They are generally placed high in the WordNet hierarchy and are related senses of highly polysemous words.

which assigns the synset shop#1 to COMMERCE, but excludes all the parts of the children of shop#1, such as barbershop#1.
Finally, the results of the inheritance procedure are evaluated in a text classification task: the main problems are detected and the manual annotations are corrected, starting a new iteration of the mapping procedure.
The effort needed to built the resource is given by a combination of the productivity of a subject field with its relevance with respect to WordNet.
Productivity. This is the ratio between the number of manual annotations and the total number of annotated synsets after the inheritance step. From the annotator point

of view, this measure indicates how "difficult" it has been to produce a certain SFC. It also gives an idea of the homogeneity of the SFC with respect to the WordNet hierarchy: a low score in productivity generally means that synsets are spread in many sub-hierarchies. For example, BIOLOGY has a very high productivity (i.e. 122), mainly because it includes scientific taxonomies. On the contrary, ECONOMY has lower productivity (i.e. 6), meaning that it takes senses from different WordNet areas.
Relevance. This measure indicates the relative coverage of the subject field, i.e. how large it is compared to the total sum of the annotated synsets. As an example, MEDICINE and ALIMENTATION have similar relevance ( 3.65% and

3.52% respectively), but different productivity (15 and 170 respectively), meaning that an higher effort is needed for building MEDICINE rather than ALIMENTATION.

3.1. SFCs and Regular Polysemy
Regular polysemy (Pustejovsky, 1995) occurs when two senses of the same words are systematically related by a logical relation. Common examples are the garlic#1 and garlic#2 senses, where the first is a plant and the second is the food derived from that plant. In Wordnet 1.6 there is no rigorous treatment of regular polysemy, that is sometimes the two senses are clearly distinguished, as in the example above; sometimes there is just one sense, which however inherits from two different paths, as for example Venice#1 which is both a region and an administrative district; sometimes the two senses are completely collapsed as for example in Paris#1. As far as semantic fields are concerned, we decided to be the more insensible to WordNet idiosyncrasies as possible. As instance:

;!hospital#1 [MEDICINE, BUILDING-INDUSTRY]

;!hospital#2 [MEDICINE, ADMINISTRATION]

;!railway-station#1

[RAILWAY, BUILDING-

INDUSTRY, ADMINISTRATION]

4. Results
Up to now 96% of the WordNet noun synsets have been marked (i.e. about 63,000 out of 66,000). We plan to conclude the annotation in a short time. Verbs and adjectives are under development and will be completed in the near future. 115 different SFCs, organized in a four level hierarchy have been used for the annotation. Table 1 shows the main figures of the assignments for the 41 SFCs placed at the second level of the hierarchy, which we consider the most informative one, plus the FACTOTUM SFC (see Section 2.3.). For each SCF the total number of synset assigned, its relevance and productivity measure, are reported. In addition, we show the precision score obtained for each SFC in the evaluation experiment, which is described in detail in Section 5.. Globally, up to now 72,763 mappings synset/SFC have been established, with an average ambiguity rate of 1.09%; 95% synsets have just a single assignment, 3% have two assignments and 2%, mainly due to regular polysemy (see Section 3.1.), have three assignments.

5. Evaluation
A quality evaluation of the SFC annotation has been carried on by means of a text classification task. This is comparable to Walker and Amsler's work (Walker and Amsler, 1986), where they use the LDOCE subject codes to identify the subject matter of wire service stories taken from The New York Times. In our evaluation task we used a corpus of short news from Adnkronos (an example is reported in Figure 2), an important Italian news provider. News are the English translation of Italian news 2, and they mainly

2The availability of the original news in Italian let us open the possibility in the future to test the assumption that SFC are basically language independent.

CULTURE: GIOTTO- PAID BY MONKS
TO WRITE ANTI-FRANCISCAN POETRY
Rome,10 Jan. -(Adnkronos)- Giotto was 'paid' to attack a faction of the Franciscans , the
Spiritual ones, who opposed church decoration in honour of Poverello di Assisi.This has been revealed in the research of an Italian scholar who is a professor at Yale University, Stefano Ugo Baldassarri, who thinks he has solved the mystery of the only known
poetry by the famous Tuscan painter: the
Giotto verses have in fact always provoked
wonder because they seem to be a criticism of the ideals of St. Francis and all the more so since their author was also the man who painted the famous frescoes of the Basilica at Assissi. ....

reports facts relevant for Italy; topics are extremely various, from medicine to politics, to sport and culture. The goal of the experiment was to obtain a measure of the quality of the SFC annotation performed by the semi-automatic procedure described in Section 3..
We started working on a training corpus of 100 news. Each news has been manually classified using a SFC selected from the list of the 41 most informative SFC (see Section 4.). Texts have been POS tagged considering only Nouns, Proper Nouns and Abbreviations.
A classification algorithm has been implemented which uses the SFC assignments to compute the probability that senses of a word in a text belong to a certain subject code. Then, for each SFC an overall score is computed taking into account the SFC hierarchy (i.e. children contribute to the score of their father). At the end, the SFC with higher score is selected as the best to classify a given text.
While at present the system performances as text classifier are not the major point, the classification errors give us cues about the quality of SFC annotations. In particular:
an high percentage of wrong classifications on the same SFC is an hint either of a overgeneration of the inheritance procedure for that code (e.g. additionally exceptions are needed), or of a wrong position of the SFC in the hierarchy; this for example happened with SFC whose content was not enough clear, such as PSYCHOLOGY, which in fact has a low precision score (see Table 1).
the inability to classify a code indicates a lack of assignments for that code (i.e. more low level synsets need to be added).
In a more advanced phase of evaluation, a more fine grained mechanism was needed. In this phase we used the training corpus to manually check the output of the classification algorithm (see Table 3): errors in SFC annotation were detected and then corrected in the declarations of

the inheritance procedure. For example, criticism#2 in Table 3, seems to be too general to be included annotated in LITERATURE, and so it has to be reassigned. Incidentally, let us note that the word "mistery" in the text, would be wrongly disambiguated with mistery#2.
After a number of iterations on the training corpus, the final evaluation was carried out on a test corpus with the same characteristics. Results are reported in Table 2. The average polysemy has been computed with respect to WordNet 1.6, considering only Nouns, Proper Nouns and Abbreviations. Checked senses are those used by the classification algorithm.

6. Conclusions and Future Work
Up to now 96% of the WordNet synsets of the noun hierarchy have been annotated. We have used 115 different SFCs, which are organized in a four level hierarchy. Annotating Wordnet noun synsets allow to group synsets which belong to the same domain, even if they belong to different sub-hierarchies.
Verbs and adjectives are under development and will be completed in the near future in order to provide crosscategorial information, which is almost absent in WordNet.
For each SFC, two measures (i.e. productivity and relevance) have been defined to quantify the effort needed to build the resource. In addition, to produce a qualitative evaluation of the SFC annotations, a text classification task has been carried out which uses SFCs as tags. Both precision and recall are satisfactory, and can be further improved with limited effort.
Even if at present the classification performances are out of our scopes, the system performed quite well, so that we intend to go deeper in this direction.
Another evaluation task we would like to carry out in the near future is a comparison of our SFCs against approaches (e.g. (Grefenstette, 1994), (Lin, 1998)), which produce sets of related word considering thesaurus-like information.
