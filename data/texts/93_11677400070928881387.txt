Abstract
This paper describes a framework for specifying behavior in terms of preference sentences of the form "prefer a to --a if3", to be interpreted as "a is preferred to -~a whenall else is fixed in any 3 world". We demonstrate how such preference sentences, together with normality defaults, maybe used as constraints on admissible preference-ranking of worlds and howthey allow a reasoning agent to evaluate queries of the form "would you prefer al over or2 given ¢" where al and ~r2 could be either action sequences or observational propositions. Wealso prove that by extending the syntax to allow for importance-rating of preference sentences, we obtain a language that is powerful enough to represent all possible preferences amongworlds.
1 Introduction
This paper describes a frameworkfor specifying planning goals in terms of preference sentences of the form "prefer a to -~a if 7". Consider an agent deciding if she should carry an umbrella, given that it is cloudy. Naturally, she will have to consider the prospect of getting wet -~d (not dry), the possibility of rain r, whether it is cloudy c, and so on. Someof the beliefs and knowledge that will influence her decision maybe expressed in conditional sentences such as: "if I have the umbrella then I will be dry", u --* d, "if it rains and I do not have the umbrella then I will be wet", r A-~u --* -~d and "typically if it is cloudy, it will rain". She mayalso have preferences like "I prefer to be dry", d ~- -~d and "I prefer not to carry an umbrella", --u ~- u. Fromthe beliefs and preferences above, we should be able to infer whether the individual will prefer to carry an umbrella if she observes that it is cloudy, assuming that being dry is more important to her than not carrying an umbrella.
The research reported in this paper concerns such decision makingprocesses. Our aim is to eventually equip an intelligent autonomousartificial agent with decision makingcapabilities, based on two types of inputs: beliefs

and preferences. Beliefs, someof which maybe defeasible, will be specified by normality defaults like "if you run across the freeway then you are likely to die". Preferences maybe encoded in conditional sentences such as "if it is morning then I prefer coffee to tea", written coffee >- tea I morning. Figure 1 shows a schematic
of the program. Each normality default ~i t" ¢i and preference sentence al >-~ 3i I 7i will be quantified by
an integer 8i or ¢i whichindicates the degree of the corresponding belief or preference. A larger degree implies a stronger belief or preference. The program will also accept queries in the form of (¢, ~rl >- tr2), whichstands for "would you prefer al over a2 given ¢?". The output of the program is the degree e to which the preference
~rl )'- a2 holds in the context ¢.
We take Bayesian decision theory and maximum
expected utility [yon Neumannand Morgenstern, 1947, Pearl, 1988, Keeneyand Raiffa, 1976] as ideal normsfor decision making. The problems with the theory are that it requires complete specifications of a probability distribution and a utility function and that the spec-
ifications are numeric. The problems with. the complete specification of numeric probabilities had been considered and partly resolved in [Goldszmidt, 1992,
Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992]. The approach is to move from numeric probabilities to qualitative, order-ofmagnitude abstractions and to use conditional state-

254

mentsof the form ~a -6-* ¢ as a specification languagethat
constrains qualitative probabilities. These constraints translate to a unique belief ranking ~(w) on worlds that permits the reasoning agent to economically maintain and update a set of deductively closed beliefs. Pearl in [Pearl, 1993] addressed the problemof numeric utilities. Paralleling the order-of-magnitude abstraction of probabilities, he introduced an integer-valued utility ranking
p(to) on worlds that, combinedwith the belief ranking ~(to), scores qualitative preferences of actions and their consequences. However, the requirement for the complete specification of the utility ranking remains problematic.
Here we propose a specification language which accepts conditional preferences of the form "if 1~ then a is preferred to -~a", ot ~- -~a I ~. Aconditional preference
of this form will also be referred to as a conditional desire, written D(al/~), whichrepresents the sentence "if/~ then ~ is desirable". The output is the evaluation of a preference query of the form (¢, o'1 ~- a2) where¢ is any general formula while 0"t and 0"~ mayeither be formulas or action sequences. The intended meaning of such query is "is 0"1 preferred to 0"2 given ¢"? Theidea is as follows. Each conditional desire D(al/~) is interpreted as "a is preferred to --~ whenall else is fixed in any ~-world". Acollection of such expressions imposes constraints over admissible preference rankings ~r(w). Fromthe set of admissible rankings we select a subset of the most compact rankings ~r+ (to), each reflecting maximalindifference. the same time we use the normality defaults to compute the set of believable worlds {to I ~(to) = 0} that mayresult after the execution or observation of 0"i given ¢. One wayof computing the beliefs prevailing after an action or observation is through the use of causal networks, as described in [Pearl, 1993]. To comparethe sets of believable worlds we introduce a preference relation between sets of worlds, called preferential dominance,that is derived from a given preference ranking ~'(to). To confirm
the preference quer), (~, 0"1 ~- a2), we comparethe of believable worlds~ resulting from executing or observing 0"1 given ~b to those resulting from executing or observing 0"2 given ~, and test if the former preferentially dominates the latter in all the most compact preference rankings. A set of worlds Wpreferentially dominates V if and only if:
1. Wprovides more and better possibilities,
2. Wprovides less possibilities but excludes poorer possibilities or
3. Wprovides better alternative possibilities
compared with V.
So far we have described the flat version of our language, wherea degree is not associated with each con-
ditional desire sentence D(~l/~).Wewill showthat the
1Thelimitation of considering only believable worlds is adoptedhere to simplify the exposition. In general, "surprising worlds" could be considered as well, in case they carry extremelypositive or negativeutilities (e.g. getting hit by a car). Asystem combiningboth likelihood and utility considerations, reflecting a qualitative versionof the expected utility criterion,is describedin [Pearl,1993].

fiat languageis not sufficient for specifying all preference rankings. In particular we exhibit a preference ranking that is not the most compactadmissible ranking with respect to any set of conditional desires. Also, by not specifying the relative importance of conditional desires, the flat language does not allow us to decide amongpreferences resulting from conflicting goals. Toalleviate these problems we allow conditional desires to be quantified
by a integer indicating the degree or strength of the desire. Weprove that this quantified language is expressive enoughto represent all preference rankings.
In the next section, we describe the language and the semantics for conditional desires. In section 3, we introduce preferential dominance between sets and show how a preference query may be evaluated. Quantified conditional desires are introduced in section 4 together with the sufficiency theorem. Related work is compared in section 5 and we conclude with a summary of the contributions of this paper.
2 Preference Specification
In this section we consider conditional desires of the form D(odfl ) where a and # are well-formed formulas obtained from a finite set of atomic propositions X = {X1,X2,...,Xn} with the usual truth functionals A, V and -1. Consider the desire sentence "I prefer to be dry", D(d). This sentence may mean that "d is preferred to -~d regardless of the truth of all the other propositions", or that "d is preferred to --,d given that all the other propositions are fixed" or someintermediate reading. In this paper we take the ceteris paribnm reading whichis "d is preferred to --,d given that all the other propositions are fixed". Similarly, the interpretation for a conditional desire D(cd~) is "o~ is preferred to -~a Whenall else is fixed in any fl-world".
To explicate the meaning of "all the other propositions", we need to distinguish between propositions that
affect the desire from those that are irrelevant to the desire. Wesay that a wff ot depends on a proposition Xi if all wits that are logically equivalent to o~ contain Xi. The set of propositions that o~ depends on is represented by I(cQ. The set of propositions that c~ does not depend on is represented by U(a) = Z \ I(cQ. Accordingly, to explicate the notion of "all else is fixed in any ~-world", we say that two worlds agree on a proposition if they assign the same truth value to the proposition. Twoworlds agree on a set of propositions if they agree on all the propositions in the set. Wesay that to and u are U-equivalent, written to ~'v u if to and u agree on the set U C_ X. Given a conditional desire D(od~) and a ~-world, to, the worlds that have "all the other propositions fixed" by to are those that are U(a)-equivalent to. Wecall D(oLIto) a specific conditional desire if to is awffofthe form/~xi, where zl = Xi or-~Xi. (As convention we will use the samesymbolto to refer to the
unique model of the wff to.)
Definition 1 (Context) Let D(alto) be a specific con-
ditional desire. The context of D(~lto), C(~,to) is defined as
C(~,to)-- {v I v ~'v(~)to}.

We write O.t(t~,w ) for {vb 7 [u E C(~,w)}where7 is
a wff.
As an examplei I(u V d) = {u,d} and the context of the specific conditional desire D(u V dluder) is {uder, u~Icr,~dcr,~cr}, the set of worlds which agree with w = udcr on all propositions except for u and d. The constraints imposed by D(u V d[uder) are shownin figure 2, where w -- v represents a constraint between w and u.
A preference ranking ~r is an integer-valued function on the set of worlds fL The intended meaning of a ranking is that the world w is no less preferred than the world u if ~r(w) _> ~r(u). Given a non-empty set of worlds, W, we write 7r,(W) for minnow 7r(w) and Ir*(W) max~w~r(w). If Wis empty then we adopt the convention that ~',(W) = co and 7r*(W) = -¢~. A cific conditional desire D(alw) imposes constraints on its context. The constraints are that every s-world in the context C(a, w) is preferred (has higher ranks) any F-world in thesame context.
Definition 2 (Admissibility of rankings) Let D be a set of conditional desires. A preference ranking ~r is admissible with respect to a conditional desire D(~I/3) if for all oa b/9,v 6 Ca(t~,w) and v' 6 C-,a(ot, w) implies

A preference ranking 7r is admissible with respect to D if it is admissible with respect to all conditional desires in D.
If there exist a ranking that is admissible with respect to a set of conditional desires, Hthen we say that His consistent. An example of an inconsistent set is D = {D(u), D(-,u)]. D is inconsistent because D(u) implies that ~'(u) > ~r(--,u) while D(-,u) implies that r(-',u)

The lr + rankings reflects maximalindifference in the reasoning agent. Consider the extreme case where the set of desires D is empty. Without compactness, all preference rnnkings are admissible and no conclusions can be drawn. Howeverwith compactness we will select the

"unique" ranking that ranks all worlds the same. In this way we make definite conclusions about the reasoning agent's lack of preferences amongworlds.
In the umbrella example, if we have the sole desire D(d) then the 7r+ rankings are

a.+(w )= {m m+lothifewrw~disaen.d
where m is an integer. These preference rankings allow us to concludethat all worlds that satisfy d are preferred over all worlds that do not.

3 Preference Evaluation
Consider the preference query, "given that it is cloudy and raining, would you prefer to have an umbrella", (cr, u ~ ",u)? Given that it is cloudy and raining, the possible scenarios for having the umbrella are udcr and udcr while the possible scenarios for not having the um-
brella are ~dcr and ~cr. If we have the desire D(d), then
the scenario u-dec where you get wet despite having_the umbrella obviously has a preference ranking 7r+(udcr) which is strictly lower than 7r+(-ddcr), the rank of remaining dry without the umbrella. Although these scenarios are highly unlikely they are nevertheless possible and they prevent us from confirming the preference query, (cr, u ~- "~u). To disregard such unlikely scenarios, we expect our reasoning agent to consider normality defaults like "if I have the umbrella then I will be dry",
u --* d and "if it rains and I do not have the umbrella then I will bewet", r A -~u --* -~d and to compute the "believability" or likelihood of the worlds after the execution of actions or observation of evidence given some context, ~b. An example of such a belief model is described in [Pearl, 1993]2. Wewill assume that the output of this model is a belief ranking ~ on worlds. We will write ~:(~b; ai) to represent the ranking that results after the execution or observation of tr i given context, ~b. tc°(~b; ~i) will represent the set of believable worlds,
namelythe set of worlds for which tc(~b; cri) is minimal (least surprising).
In a framework that tolerates imprecision and uncertainty, the consequenceof the execution of an action or the observation of evidence maynot be a specific world but a' set of believable worlds. Thus to confirm a preference query we will need to define preference between sets of worlds. The straightforward approach would be
to say that a set W(of believable worlds) is preferred over another set V if every world in Wis preferred over any world in V. This criterion however is too restric-
tive. Consider the case where we have worlds u, v and w with ranks 0, 1 and 999 respectively. Let W={u, w] and V = {u, v}. The additional possibility w offered by W, which has rank 999 is preferred over the additional possibility v offered by V, which has a rank of 1. So in this case we would clearly prefer Wover V as the additional possibility offered by Wis so muchbetter than the additional possibility offered by V. This preference

however is not sanctioned by the criteria above. The reason for this is that the sets of: commonpossibilities, additional possibilities offered and excludedpossibilities are not considered separately. This motivates the definition of preferential dominance,a preference criterion between sets that depends on whether one set includes
or overlaps the other. In figure 3, Wf-dominates V, (written W:,-, V),
the worlds in the dominating set are preferred over the worlds in the dominated set. For example, if WC V then we will still prefer Wif the additional possibilities offered by V are worse than what we already have in W. On the other hand if V C W, we should prefer Wover Vif the possibilities excluded by V are all preferred to those that are left. In the general case, both V and W mayoffer somepossibilities that are not offered by the other, in which ease we simply comparethese additional possibilities, while ignoring the commopnossibilities.
Definition 4 (Preferential Dominance) Let W and V be two subsets of ~ and let r be a preference ranking. We say that W f-dominates V, written W >-,r V, if and only if W ~ V and
1. r.(w)> r*(v\ w)wheWn c e. r.(W\ V)>r'(V)wheWn Z S. r.(W\ V)>r'(V\ W)otherwise.
To confirm the preference query (¢, al >- ~2), we compare the set of believable worlds resulting from executing or observing ~1 given ~b to those resulting from executing or observing ~2 given ~b, and test if the former preferentially dominates the latter in all the most compact preference rankings.
Definition 5 (Preferential Entailment) Let D be a set of conditional desires and g be some belief ranking
on ~. ~ preferentially entails ~1 ~- ¢r2 given (D, g), written ~ ~,, (~l ~- o'2), if andonly if

for all 9+ rankings of D.
Example Let us reconsider the umbrella story where we need to verify the preference query "would you prefer to have the umbrella given that it is cloudy", (c; u >- -~u)? have four atomic propositions, u - have umbrella, d dry, c- cloudy and r - rain. Let us assume that we have the normality defaults, A = {u ---, d, r A --u --d, c ---, r} and one unconditional desire, D= {D(d)}. For this example we will adopt the belief model in

Table 1: Rankings in the umbrella example

[Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992, Pearl, 1993]. First we process the defaults set Ato get the resulting belief rankings g(w). Next, table 1 lists the possible worlds, given that it is cloudy, and gives the belief ranking g(w) and the 7r+ preference ranking, where m is some fixed integer, g°(c;u) {udcr} an d ha s ra nk m + 1 while g°(c;-~u) {~cr} with ra nk m. Therefore the pref erence query (c; u N-~u) is confirmed.
4 Quantified Conditional Desires
A typical reasoning agent may have many desires. She maydesire to be alive, D(a), desire to be dry, D(d) and also desire not to carry an umbrella, D(-~u). These desires are not all equally important; being alive is more important than being dry and being dry is probably more important than not carrying an umbrella. In the specification language described so far there is no mechanism for indicating the varying degrees of preference. Let us examine the consequences of this limitation.
Suppose, in the umbrella example, that we have the desire n(-~u) in addition to the desire n(d). These desires impose two sets of constraints on the preference rankings, yielding
m+l ifw ~dA-~uand 7r+(w)= m-1 ifw ~-~dAuand
m otherwise
as the most compact ranking. Nowg°(c; u) has the sin-
gle world udcr while g°(c; -~u) has the single world ~cr, both of rank m. This leads to counterintuitive indifference between udcr and ~cr, assuming that the desire to remain dry is more important that the desire not to carry an umbrella.
The unquantified specification language is also not expressive enoughto express all possible preferences. Consider the preference rankings, 7rl and 7r2, shownin table 2. For any set of conditional desires, 7r2 is admissible whenever 7rl is admissible because the language does not allow us to impose a constraint between ab and ~b. Furthermore 7r2 is more compact than 7rl because E I~(~) - ~l(v)l = 7 > E Ir~(~) - ~(v)l = 6. Therefore 7rl cannot be the 7r+ ranking for any set of conditional desires. This meansthat if 7rl represents our preference among worlds then there is no way we can

257

Worlds,~wbIa1brlabO0~W7lr'2)[(w)0211 Table 2: Preference Rankings, ~h and ~r2

express our preferences exactly, in terms of conditional desires alone.
To alleviate these weaknesseswe extend the syntax of the specification language by quantifying a conditional desire with an integer e which indicates the strength of the desire. Aquantified conditional desire is a preference
expressionof the formD~(e~lg),wheree is a integer, read: "Giveng, a is preferred to --a by e".

(4)

A preference ranking is admissible with respect to D if it is admissible with respect to all desires in D.
An unquantified conditional desire is assumed to have a default degree of e = 1.

Example with multiple desires Let us reconsider the umbrella example assuming, that we have two desires D2(d) and Dl(-.u). The degrees of these desires indicate that the desire to remain dry
is more important by an order of magnitude than the discomfort of carrying an umbrella. The most compact preference ranking in this case is

~r+(w)

rn
m~ m+l m

ifw ~ dA-~u and ifw~dAuand
ifw~-~dA-mand otherwise

The believable worlds are ~:°(c; u) {udcr} with ra nk
m + 2 and tc°(c;--,u) (~cr} with ra nk m + 1. This confirms the preference query (c; u ~- "-u) (with degree
1).
Theorem 1 (Sufiieieney of the Language) For all preference rankings, ~r, there exists a set of quantified conditional desires, II, such that r is the most compact ranking admissible with respect to H.

5 Comparison with Related Work
Verification of the assertability of conditional ought statements of the form "you ought to do A if C" is considered in [Pearl, 1993]. The conditional ought statement is interpreted as "if you observe, believe or know C then the expected utility resulting from doing A is much higher than that resulting from not doing A".

The treatment in [Pearl, 1993] assumed that a complete specification of a utility ranking on worlds is available. Another problem is that the conclusions of the system is not invariant under a translation of the utility ranking; for example utility rankings 7rl and 7r9., where 7r2(w) = ~'l(w) + 1, mayadmit different conclusions.
In [Doyle et al., 1991, Wellman and Doyle, 1991],
preference semantics were given for goals and relative desires. The account is very similar to our semantics for unquantified unconditional desires. Howeverthe treatmentof conditional preferences (called restricted relative desires) of the form "given 7, a is preferred over fl" is problematic. In particular the semantics allows us to conclude that we must be indifferent a to the inevitable. This fatalistic view showsitself in a theorem: "you must be indifferent to a, given ~". Thus if you discovered that your car has been stolen then you must be indiffer-
ent to it. While somemaysubscribe to such a fatalistic attitude, our semantics here is more optimistic.
In [Boutilier, 1993], expressions of conditional preferences of the form"I(~lg) - if g then ideally cd', are given
modal logic semantics in terms of a preference ordering
on possible worlds. I(alg) is interpreted as "in the most
preferred worlds where g holds, a holds as well". This interpretation places constraints only on the most preferred g-worlds, allowing only g-worlds that also satisfy
to have the same "rank". This contrasts with our ceteris paribum semantics which places constraints between pairs of worlds. In discussing the reasoning from preference expressions to actual preferences (preference query in our paper) Boutilier [Boutilier, 1993] suggests that the techniques (for handling irrelevance in particular) could be similarly applied to preferential reasoning. For example he suggests that worlds could be assumed to be as preferred or as ideal as possible which parallels the assumption made in computing the r+ belief ranking [Goldszmidt, 1992], that worlds are as normal as possible. While it is intuitive to assume that worlds would gravitate towards normality because abnormality is a monopolarscale, it is not at all clear that worlds ought to be as preferred as possible since preference is a bipolar scale. In our proposal there is no preference for either end of the bipolar preference scale. The rr + rank-
ings actually compacts the worlds towards the middle of the scale. It remains to be seen if the I operator corresponds closely with the commonlinguistic use of the word "ideally".
In [Pinkas and Loui, 1992] consequence relations are classified according to their boldness (or 'cautiousness). Wemayalso employ a bolder (or more cautious) entailment principle which would correspond to a risk seeking (or risk averse) disposition.
6 Conclusion
In this paper we have described a frameworkfor specifying behavior in terms of preference sentences of the form "prefer c~ to -~ if g", interpreted as "~ is preferred to -~ when all else is fixed in any g world". Wedemonstrate howsuch preference sentences, together with nor-

Wealso prove that by extending the syntax to allow for the quantification of preference sentences, representing their importance, we have a language that is powerful enoughto represent all possible preferences between worlds. This work is an extension of [Pearl, 1993] and [Doyle et hi., 1991].
A Proofs
Definition 7 Given a preference ranking a-, Dr = {d [ r is admissible with respect to d}.
Lemma 1 (Common Contexts) E C(c~,w) ::
w) = u).
Lemma2 (Extreme worlds) Let a- be a preference ranking and let # be admissible with respect to Dr: For all contexts C,
a-(w)= ma-(u)p(w)
and a-(w) = mina-(u)~ec =~/J(w) = ~i~#(v)

by corollary 1. Therefore we may assume that r(w) 7r(w.) > 0. Weconsider the context, C = C(A~ )x.ilw
If we can find a world v "~x\x~ w, v ~ ~xi such that a-(w) _> rr(v) then let d = Dr(~)_r(v)(Xilw) r andwe also have d implies #(w) - #(v) > a-(w) - a-(u). Otherwise, let v be such that a-(v) = maxv,ec a-(v') and D~(~)-r(~)(/kx k xilw)e r. I n t his c ase, b y l emma 2, we also have d implies #(w)- p(v) _> 7r(w) - a-(v). clearly, in both cases, v ¢ w. This implies, by the induction hypothesis, that #(v) - p(w.) > r(v) - a-(w.). adding the two inequalitites, we get the desired inequality p(w) - p(w,) > 7r(w) a- (~,).
Lemma4 (Smaller Admissible Differences) Let rr be a preference ranking and let p be admissible with respect to Dr. For all w E f~,
Proof: For all worlds w, Dr(~.)-r(~0)(-'w) r. This implies #(w) - #(w.) _< a-(w) - a-(w.).
Lemma5 (Uniqueness) Let a- be a preference ranking. If# is admissible with respect to D~ then

Proof: Let w E C and xi be Xi if w ~ Xi and "~Xi otherwise. By lemma 1 we may assume that C = C(ot, w) for some wff a. Consider/~ = ]\x,ei(a)xiIf a'(w) = max~eca-(v ) then Do(/~l w) E D'~. This implies that p(w) > #(v) for all v E C. Therefore
a-(w) = mxv ca-(u) m,(w) = maxvC,(u).
a-(w) = minvec a-(v) then Do(--,l~lw) e r. This i mplies that #(w) < p(v) for all v E C. So a-(w) minv~c a-(v) =~ p(w) = minv~c #(u).
Corollary 1 (Extreme worlds) Let r be a preference r'~a.nking and let # be admissible with respect to D
a-(w) = maXv~aqr(v) ~ #(w) =

a-(w.).

Theorem 1 (Sufficiency of the Language) For all preference rankings, 7r, there exists a set of quantified conditional desires, II, such that a- is the most compact ranking admissible with respect to II. In fact a- is unique up to a linear translation.

Proof." This theorem follows as a corollary of lemma5

by setting II to be D~.

n

and a-(w) = mina-(u)~en =~#(w) = ~i~#(v)
Given a preference ranking, we write w. for a world that has the minimumrank and w*for a world that has maXimumrank.
Lemma3 (Larger Admissible Differences) Let r be a preference ranking and let p be admissible with respect to D~. For all w E 12,
p(w) -#(w.) > a-(w) - a-(w.).
Proof: We will prove by induction on m, the number of variables wand w. disagree on. In the base case, if m = 0 then w = w.. Therefore the lemmaholds trivially. Let us assume that the lemmaholds for m = 0,..., k- 1. Without loss of generality, we may assume that w and w. disagree on Y = {X1,...,Xk} and that w ~ zi for i = 1,...,m. If a-(w) = a-(w.) then the theorem holds
