NK1.1+
g TCR+ (NKT) cells have several important roles including tumor rejection and pre-
vention of autoimmune disease. Although both CD4+ and CD4–CD8– double-negative (DN)
subsets of NKT cells have been identified, they are usually described as one population.
Here, we show that NKT cells are phenotypically, functionally and developmentally hetero-
geneous, and that three distinct subsets (CD4+, DN and CD8+) are differentially distributed in
a tissue-specific fashion. CD8+ NKT cells are present in all tissues but the thymus, and are
– cells. These subsets differ in their expression of a range of cell
highly enriched for CD8 §
surface molecules (V g 8, DX5, CD69, CD45RB, Ly6C) and in their ability to produce IL-4 and
IFN- + , with splenic NKT cell subsets producing lower levels than thymic NKT cells. Develop-
mentally, most CD4+ and DN NKT cells are thymus dependent, in contrast to CD8+ NKT cells,
and are also present amongst recent thymic emigrants in spleen and liver. TCR J § 281-
deficient mice show a dramatic deficiency in thymic NKT cells, whereas a significant NKT
cell population (enriched for the DN and CD8+ subsets) is still present in the periphery. Taken
together, this study reveals a far greater level of complexity within the NKT cell population
than previously recognized.

1 Introduction

NK1.1+T (NKT) cells represent a distinct and functionally
important T cell lineage (reviewed in [1–5]). They have
a heavily biased TCR repertoire, with 50 % V g 8.2+
(reviewed in [1–5]) and 85 % V § 14J § 281+ [6] and depend
on CD1d expression for their development and activa-
tion [7–9]. An important characteristic of NKT cells is
their ability to produce high levels of cytokines including
IL-4 and IFN- (cid:29) . NKT cells express many markers com-
monly associated with the NK cell
lineage including
NK1.1, CD122, CD16, DX5 and Ly49 family members
([10]; reviewed in [1–5]). They also bear an activated phe-
notype, i.e. CD44high, CD69+, CD62Llow, and unlike most
conventional T cells, NKT cells express CD38 [11] and
Ly6C [12].

NKT cells are present in most tissues where T cells
are found (reviewed in [1–5]) and their developmental
origin/s remain a point of controversy. Some research
groups argue that these cells can develop in the absence
of a thymus [13, 14], probably in the liver or bone marrow
[15, 16] whereas others have shown that NKT cells were
not present in athymic/nude mice and have provided
data supporting the idea that NKT cells are a thymus-
dependent population [1, 17–19]. NKT cells develop in
fetal thymic organ culture, which indicates that they can
develop from intrathymic precursors [20]. However,
V § 14-J § 281 gene rearrangements, characteristic of NKT
cells, have also been detected in bone marrow-derived
CD3 4

– NKT cell precursors [16].

NKT cells are a functionally important population in vivo.
A direct relationship exists between a deficiency in NKT
cells and susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in nonobese
diabetic (NOD) mice [21–25], with similar evidence in
humans with type 1 diabetes [26]. A deficiency in NKT
cells has also been implicated in some other autoim-
mune diseases including autoimmune gastritis in day 3
neonatally thymectomized mice [19], lupus-like disease
in C57BL/6 lpr and NZB/NZW mice [27, 28], and

including

NKT cells include CD4+ and double-negative (DN) sub-
sets; however, they are generally described as a homo-
geneous population of cells. Whether these subsets
reflect a significant subdivision in the NKT cell population
is unknown. Furthermore, although CD8+ NKT cells have

been identified [19, 41], little is known about these and
how they compare to other NKT cells. Clearly, if we are to
understand the role of NKT cells, and resolve apparent
contrast in their developmental and functional character-
istics, we need to understand how different subsets of
NKT cells relate to each other. In this study, we reveal a
previously unrecognized level of heterogeneity among
NKT cell subsets (CD4+, DN, CD8+)
including their
tissue-specific distribution, cell surface markers, IL-4/
IFN- + production, thymus dependence and TCR expres-
sion. Taken together, this study indicates that the classi-
fication of NKT cells simply by co-expression of NK1.1
and §
g TCR is too general and may confuse investigation
into the role of NKT cells in the immune system.

2 Results

2.1 NKT cells are differentially distributed in a

tissue-specific manner

NKT cells from different tissues were compared with
regard to proportion and total number (Table 1). NKT
cells were present in all tissues tested, although their rel-
ative frequency varied widely in a tissue-specific manner.
Similar absolute numbers of NKT cells were present in
thymus, spleen and liver (Table 1) although their numbers
increased in the latter two organs in an age-dependent

that were NKT cells also varied widely between tissues,
supporting the idea that NKT cells do not exhibit the
same trafficking/homing characteristics as the T cell
population in general. The relative distribution of subsets
of NKT cells defined by CD4/CD8 expression was also
found to be tissue specific (Table 1, Fig. 1). As previously

much lower proportion of DN and CD8+ NKT cells were
CD69+. CD45RB expression by NKT cells is controver-
sial, with one review article referring to them as
CD45RBhigh [1] and others as CD45RBlow [4, 5]. This may
in part be due to the differential expression of CD45RB
by subsets of NKT cells as shown here. CD4+ NKT cells

diate, whereas CD4– and CD8+ NKT cells in the thymus and

more frequent among CD4– and CD8+ NKT cells. Other
cell surface molecules tested include CD28, Fas,

itive on all NKT cell subsets (data not shown).

the spleen. The CD8+ splenic NKT cells did not produce
detectable levels of IL-4. Similar to whole splenic NKT
cells, each of the subsets produced negligible levels of
IFN- + . These results demonstrate clear differences in the
functional capacity of NKT cells between the thymus and
spleen, and also within splenic NKT cell subsets.

NKT cells are phenotypically heterogeneous is whether
NKT cell subsets are functionally distinct. To this end,
sorted NKT cell subsets were stimulated in vitro by
immobilized anti-CD3, and IL-4 and IFN- + production
determined by ELISA (Table 3). As expected, thymic NKT
cells produced high levels of IL-4 and IFN- + [42, 43]. Fur-
thermore, our results indicate that CD4+ and DN thymic

2.4.1 CD4+ and DN NKT cells, but not CD8+ NKT

cells, are thymus dependent

Considering the controversy surrounding the develop-
mental origin of NKT cells and our results showing clear
differences between NKT cell subsets, one possibility
was that these subsets may have distinct developmental
origins.

We have previously reported that day 3 neonatal thy-
mectomy leads to a specific reduction in NKT cell num-
bers in peripheral
tissues of adult mice [19]. More
detailed analysis indicates that both CD4+ and DN NKT
cells were significantly reduced, accounting for the drop
in total NKT cell numbers, whereas CD8+ NKT cells in the
spleen and liver were not affected in neonatally thymec-
tomized mice (Fig. 4). Thus, either CD8+ NKT cells are a
thymus-independent population, or they develop in and
leave the thymus prior to day 3 and are maintained in the
periphery in a thymus-independent fashion thereafter.
We consider the latter possibility less likely, as NKT cells
are not detected in the neonatal thymus until at least
day 7 [19], and CD8+ NKT cells are not detected in the
thymus of adult mice (Fig. 1, Table 1) or young mice at
any age tested (including day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14; data not
shown).

2.4.2 CD4+ and CD4– NKT cells migrate from the

thymus to peripheral organs

A straightforward approach to determining the thymic
origin of NKT cell subsets is to test whether these cells
are present amongst recent thymic emigrants (RTE). We

injected FITC into thymic lobes in vivo, and analyzed

RTE detected in these experiments was between 0.5 and
1.5 %, as expected from previous studies in our labo-
ratory. NK1.1+ cells represented 1.1 % of splenic
RTE and, as in the thymus, both CD4+ and CD4– subsets
were present (Fig. 5, Table 4). In some experiments the

CD4–

CD4– NK1.1+ RTE were further subdivided on the basis of
g TCR expression. Of CD4–NK1.1+ RTE, 40 % were
g TCR+ (DN NKT cells) and 38 % were CD4–
g TCR– (NK) cells. Very few NK1.1+ cells were found
among RTE homing to the lymph node (data not shown),
as expected since this is not a tissue in which NKT cells
normally reside.

g TCR+ (75 %),

For the first time we report that a significant proportion of
liver lymphocytes are RTE (1.4 %). Moreover, NK1.1+
cells comprised 4.4 % of this population and the majority
including CD4+ and CD4– cells
were §
(Fig. 5, Table 4). This is an important observation as the
liver is proposed to be a site of extrathymic NKT cell
development [15, 16]. As all livers were perfused via the
hepatic portal veins in situ, the level of blood contamina-
tion was extremely low and could account for less than
1 % of liver RTE (data not shown). This directly demon-
strates that at least some liver NKT cells are thymus
derived.

2.5 Modulation of NKT cell phenotype

In contrast to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells which
express uniformly high levels of CD4 and CD8, NKT cells
range from DN to CD4+ or CD8+, with intermediate cells
also detectable. This may reflect
transitional stages
between one NKT cell subset and another. In support of
this possibility, a recent study [44] showed that splenic
CD4+ NKT cells partially down-regulated CD4 expression
on some cells following in vitro stimulation on anti-CD3
after 4 days of culture. We isolated CD4+ and DN NKT
cells from the thymus and spleen, stimulated them for
2 days in the presence of anti-CD3, and subsequently
examined their CD4/CD8 phenotype (Fig. 6). As reported
for splenic CD4+ NKT cells, CD4+ thymic NKT cells par-
tially down-regulated CD4. These cells remained CD8–.

Figure 6. CD4+ NKT cells down-regulate CD4 expression
following in vitro stimulation. Thymic CD4+, DN NKT cells
and conventional NK1.1– CD4+ thymocytes were sorted and
stimulated on plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb for 48 h. Cells
were subsequently harvested from the wells and restained
with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 (thick line). Samples of unstained
cultured cells were also examined to account for back-
ground fluorescence due to the original reagents used for
sorting (thin line). Profiles shown are representative of three
separate experiments.

Stimulated DN thymic NKT cells did not alter their
CD4–CD8– phenotype. Similar, although less pronounced
results were obtained using CD4+ or DN NKT cells from
spleen, that is, CD4+ NKT cells showed some CD4
down-regulation and neither subset up-regulated CD8
(data not shown). Although this supports the possibility
for at least a one-way transition from CD4+ to CD4– NKT
cells in vivo, it remains possible that other transitions
occur (e.g. CD4– to CD4+ or CD8+), but perhaps require
different microenvironmental conditions not present in
our in vitro cultures.

2.6 NKT cell subsets are differentially dependent
on invariant TCR V > 14J > 281 for development
or survival

The majority of thymic NKT cells have been shown to
express the invariant TCR V § 14J § 281 chain [6]. Further-
more, TCR-J § 281-deficient mice have a dramatically
reduced NKT cell pool, particularly in the thymus, pre-
sumably due to this TCR gene product being an essen-
tial part of the invariant TCR § chain expressed by NKT
cells [35]. We tested J § 281-deficient mice to determine
whether any J § 281-independent NKT cells exist, and
whether these represent particular CD4/CD8-defined
subsets. In line with the earlier study by Cui et al. [35],
thymic NKT cells were greatly reduced to approximately
10 % of normal wild-type (WT) levels (Fig. 7 A and B). Of
the remaining NKT cells in these thymi, CD4+ and DN
subsets were represented in proportions similar to those
in WT mice. In contrast to the thymus, a clear population
of NKT cells was detectable in all other tissues, including
spleen, liver, bone marrow (Fig. 7 A and B), lymph nodes
and peritoneal cavity (data not shown). For example, in
the spleen, NKT cells were only reduced to 35 % of WT
numbers with similar results obtained in other tissues.
Analysis of the NKT cell subsets that remained showed
that there was a dramatic reduction in CD4+ NKT cells,
whereas DN and CD8+ NKT cells were unaffected. The
few thymic NKT cells and splenic CD4+ NKT cells which
remain may represent the small proportion (15 %) of NKT
cells which do not express the invariant TCR-V § 14J § 281
[20]. Apparently these cells are not subject to homeo-
static pressure to expand and fill their respective NKT
cell compartments.

3 Discussion

g TCR+DN thymocytes were first described in 1987 [45,
46] and subsequently found to express the NK cell
marker NK1.1 [17, 47]. Two years later, a subset of CD4+
thymocytes were also found to express NK1.1 [48] and
g TCR+ DN
these shared many characteristics with the §

Figure 7. NKT cells are reduced but not absent in J § 281-deficient mice. Thymus, spleen, bone marrow and liver cell suspen-
sions were prepared from WT and J § 281-deficient mice and labeled with mAb specific for NK1.1,
g TCR, CD4 and CD8, and
analyzed by flow cytometry. (A) Thymus and spleen lymphocytes are represented, with NKT cells shown in the first dot plots and
the region shown was used to generate CD4 versus CD8 expression profiles on these cells in the second dot plots. Profiles pre-
sented are representative of at least six different mice. (B) The mean ± SD of the absolute number of NKT cells from each tissue

cells, including biased TCR gene usage [6, 45, 46, 48, 49]
and high levels of cytokine production [42, 43]. Probably
because of the similarity between these cells and the
apparent absence of a functional role for the CD4 mole-
cule expressed by some of them (CD4+ NKT cell devel-
opment does not depend on MHC class II [8, 20]), NKT
cells are often regarded as a single population of cells
which are present in the thymus and periphery. Further
NKT cell heterogeneity was alluded to in an early publi-
cation [17], with the description of a subset of CD8+ NKT
cells in the bone marrow, although no data were shown.
No further mention of these cells was made until more
recently [19, 50]. In fact, most major review articles on
NKT cells have either ignored or refuted the existence of
CD8+ NKT cells [1, 4, 5]. It is clear that CD8high NKT cells
do not exist in the thymus, and furthermore, forced
expression of CD8 by NKT cells leads to intrathymic
deletion of these cells [20]. However, at least some thy-
mic NKT cells express very low levels of CD8 ([51] and
Fig. 1) which may explain why the CD8 § gene is deme-
g TCR+ “DN” thymocytes [52]. Also, NKT
thylated in §
cells from CD8-deficient mice display altered TCR V g
gene usage [20], suggesting a role for CD8 in their devel-
opment.

The first part of this study demonstrated that the fre-
quency of NKT cells relative to conventional T cells var-
ied between tissues, as did the proportion of CD4/CD8-
defined subsets and these observations alone suggest
that they are not functionally identical. For example,
whereas CD4+ NKT cells were the major NKT cell subset
in thymus, spleen, blood and liver, they were a relatively
minor subset compared to DN and/or CD8+ NKT cells in
some other tissues including lymph nodes, bone mar-
row, peritoneal cavity and lung. Whether this represents
differential access to, or survival within, these tissues
is unknown but nonetheless, it demonstrates distinct
behavior between subsets of NKT cells. These CD4/
CD8-defined NKT cell subsets varied in their particular
TCR gene usage, including V g 8.2 and V § 14J § 281, and a
range of other cell surface molecules. Considering that
CD69 is expressed at a higher frequency among thymic
NKT cells and CD4+ splenic NKT cells, compared to DN
and CD8+ splenic NKT cells, and that CD69 expression
by conventional T cells is a sign of recent activation, this
suggests that these subsets are being differentially stim-
ulated in vivo. Variability was also detected in the expres-
sion levels of DX5, CD45RB and Ly6C between CD4+,
DN and CD8+ NKT cell subsets in thymus and spleen.

Although all subsets ranged in the expression of
CD45RB and Ly6C from low to high, the DN and CD8+
subsets tended to express a higher level of these mark-
ers. Although no function has been identified for DX5,
Ly6C is a stimulatory molecule for conventional T cells
[53], and Ly6C and CD45RB levels correlate with func-
tionally distinct subsets of T cells [54, 55]. Taken
together, the differential expression of these molecules
by different NKT cell subsets further supports the likeli-
hood that these cells are functionally distinct in vivo.

Perhaps the most important characteristic that distin-
guished these CD4/CD8-defined subsets of NKT cells
was their ability to secrete cytokines. It is well docu-
mented that thymus-derived NKT cells are rapid and
potent producers of IL-4 and IFN- + , as well as other
cytokines including IL-5, IL-10, TNF and lymphotactin [5,
42, 43] following in vitro stimulation on anti-CD3. How-
ever, whether comparable results can be obtained from
NKT cells in the spleen and other peripheral organs is
less clear. CD4+ NKT cells from the spleen have been
in vitro although the
shown to produce IL-4 and IFN- +
kinetics of production were significantly slower such that
they were barely detectable within 24 h of culture [56].
This potential inconsistency between thymic and splenic
NKT cells is directly demonstrated in our results showing
that NKT cells from the spleen produced far lower levels
of IL-4 and IFN- + within 20 h of stimulation compared to
those from the thymus, despite identical stimulation con-
ditions. Moreover, of the NKT cells within the spleen, the
DN fraction produced less IL-4 than the CD4+ fraction
and the CD8 fraction did not produce detectable levels
of this cytokine. In these experiments we chose to mea-
sure cytokine secretion at 20 h post anti-CD3 stimulation
because rapid cytokine production is a key characteristic
of NKT cells [43, 57–59] and longer periods of stimula-
tion could allow a minor subset of IL-4-producing cells to
induce IL-4 in the rest of the population [60]. Our results
suggest that either splenic NKT cell subsets produce
lower levels of IL-4/IFN- + shortly after activation, or that
there are differences in the activation requirements of
thymic and splenic NKT cell populations. For example,
splenic NKT cells may be more dependent on the pres-
ence of additional factors such as IL-12, which has been
shown to promote higher IFN- + production by NKT cells
[61], and IL-7 which enhances IL-4 production by these
cells [57, 59]. In contrast to our results from in vitro stim-
ulation of splenic NKT cells, a rapid burst of IL-4 and
IFN- +
is produced by NKT cells derived from spleen 30 to
90 min after in vivo injection of anti-CD3 [58, 59], an
effect that could not be reproduced by in vitro anti-CD3
stimulation [58]. Two possibilities were suggested by
these investigators: either the microenvironmental con-
ditions in the intact spleen are important for rapid cyto-
kine induction, however, culture of splenic fragments

could not reproduce the response in vivo; or that the
cytokine-producing cells migrated to the spleen directly
after anti-CD3 stimulation.

The functional differences described here may be rele-
vant in terms of explaining the role of different subsets,
or origins, of NKT cells in vivo. For example thymic
g TCR+DN T cells have been shown to be responsible
for systemic immune deviation which occurs in the
model of anterior chamber-associated immune deviation
and their
removal by thymectomy abolishes this
response, despite the fact that peripheral NKT cells are
present [30]. In addition, our previous studies show that
type 1 diabetes in NOD mice is associated with a pro-
g TCR+DN NKT cells,
found deficiency in thymic
whereas these cells were only marginally reduced in the
spleen and lymph nodes [21]. Furthermore, adoptive
g TCR+DN NKT cells can prevent dia-
transfer of thymic §
g TCR+DN
betes in normal NOD mice. Similarly, thymic §
NKT cells were able to prevent diabetes induction in an
IL-4-dependent manner in a passive transfer model
where 2 × 107 diabetogenic NOD spleen cells were
transferred into pre-diabetic irradiated NOD recipients
[24]. The lowest dose of NKT cells that could mediate
protection was 1.5 × 105 cells. A similar study was
recently published by Lehuen et al. [25], where NKT cells
from the spleen of TCR-V § 14J § 281-transgenic NOD
mice (which have increased NKT cell numbers) were co-
transferred with 1 × 106 diabetogenic NOD T cells into
NOD-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) recipient
mice. NKT cells also prevented diabetes development in
these studies. However, a significantly higher number
(approximately 8 × 105) of NKT cells was required to
mediate protection, despite 20-fold fewer diabetogenic T
cells co-transferred. Although IL-4 production by thymic
and splenic NKT cells was not directly compared in this
study, it is tempting to speculate that an important differ-
ence between these adoptive transfer studies was the
functional potential of
thymus-versus spleen-derived
NKT cells, as would be suggested by our data.

Although NKT cells have been associated with both Th2-
and Th1-type immune responses (reviewed in [2]), their
apparently coincident production of IL-4 and IFN- + has
complicated hypotheses as to how they might bias
toward one type of response versus the other. Possible
explanations include distinct NKT cell subsets producing
one or the other cytokine, or different microenvironmen-
tal conditions influencing the cytokine repertoire of these
cells. The latter is clearly possible. For example, as
stated above, IL-12 can selectively promote IFN- + pro-
duction, while IL-7 can promote IL-4 production by these
cells. Also, cross-linking NK1.1 on the cell surface of
NKT cells leads them to preferentially produce IFN- +
without IL-4 [62]. Our studies demonstrate that CD4+ and

§

Diversity of NKT cells

3777

DN splenic NKT cells can produce IL-4 with greatly
reduced levels of IFN- + . Thus, these cytokines are not
always produced concomitantly at high levels.

Given that CD4+ NKT cells migrate from the thymus to the
periphery,
including the spleen and liver, the reduced
cytokine production by CD4+ NKT cells from the spleen
may indicate a change in their functional state after leav-
ing the thymus, rather than the existence of completely
distinct cell populations in each tissue. It is unlikely that
the differences reflect a difference in the level of stimula-
tion these cells were receiving in vivo prior to removal, as
CD69 and CD45RB were both expressed at similar levels
between thymic and splenic CD4+ NKT cells. Although
thymic CD4– NKT cells also migrated from the thymus to
spleen, and both thymic and splenic DN NKT cells pro-
duced IL-4 (albeit at lower levels by the latter), the resident
DN NKT cells in the spleen appeared to be more distinct
than their thymic counterparts. They were not as heavily
biased toward V g 8.2, and were not significantly reduced
in TCR-J § 281-deficient mice. A higher proportion of them
expressed DX5 and a lower proportion expressed CD69.
One possibility is that DN NKT cells in the spleen repre-
sent a mixture of two distinct cell populations: one with a
biased TCR and the potential to produce IL-4 and another
which does not have biased TCR expression and cannot
make IL-4. It is also possible that in J § 281-deficient mice,
the latter population expands to fill the niche(s) occupied
by the former population. The observation that some
CD4+ NKT cells down-regulate CD4 following stimulation
(Fig. 6 and [44]) suggests they may also contribute to the
DN NKT cell population in the thymus and/or spleen,
although the ultimate fate of stimulated CD4+ NKT cells is
unknown. CD8+ NKT cells probably represent a distinct
lineage of cells, as these were not only unable to produce
IL-4, but were also thymus independent, V § 14J § 281
independent and were only slightly biased toward V g 8.2
usage. Furthermore, their expression of other cell surface
molecules (Fig. 3) made them phenotypically distinct from
the CD4+ and DN NKT cell subsets. However, CD8+ NKT
cells are also distinct from conventional CD8+ T cells in
that the majority are CD8 §

–.

+

The possibility that different lineages of NKT cells exist
may have some impact on the ongoing controversy sur-
rounding the developmental origin of NKT cells
(reviewed in [1]). Most CD4+ and DN NKT cells in the
periphery were thymus dependent (Figs. 4 and 5), and
both subsets of NKT cells were present among RTE traf-
ficking not only to the spleen, but also the liver (a pro-
posed site of extrathymic NKT cell development).
Although “thymus dependence” suggests a thymic ori-
gin for these cells, it remains possible that at least some
of them originate in the periphery and their survival or
expansion is thymus dependent. The CD8+ NKT cells,

which were unaffected by day 3 neonatal thymectomy,
probably remain present as NK1.1+
g TCR+ T cells in
athymic mice, and in some instances, such as T cell
factor-1-deficient mice, may even expand in the absence
of the other NKT cell subsets [50].

In summary, the results in this report have revealed a pre-
viously unrecognized degree of heterogeneity within the
population of T cells defined by NK1.1 expression. These
differences are likely to have contributed to some of the
controversy surrounding NKT cell development and
function. More importantly, this study highlights the fact
that the simple classification of NKT cells as NK1.1-
expressing T cells, regardless of CD4/CD8 expression,
and tissue of origin is too broad. This will be particularly
important
in studies where these cells, or subsets
thereof, are isolated for adoptive transfer, or expanded in
vitro or in vivo for further analysis in animal models, and
ultimately in clinical studies utilizing these cells to manip-
ulate the immune response to tumors and/or autoim-
mune diseases.

4 Materials and methods

4.1 Animals

Unmanipulated 5–6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were
used unless otherwise indicated. Most mice were obtained
from the SPF Biological Facility at Little Bay, Sydney and
maintained under clean conditions in the Centenary Institute
Animal House. Some unmanipulated C57BL/6 mice were
obtained from Monash University Central Animal House.
J § 281-deficient mice and age-matched controls were
obtained from the Austin Research Institute animal house.

4.2 Day 3 neonatal thymectomy

Mice were neonatally thymectomized at day 3 as described
previously [63]. Mice were killed between 6 and 12 weeks of
age for analysis.

4.3 In vivo labeling of thymocytes with FITC

The technique for in vivo thymocyte labeling with FITC has
been described previously in detail [64]. Briefly, mice were
anesthetized and intrathymically injected with 10 ? l FITC
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) (0.5 mg/ml in PBS) per lobe, killed
16–36 h later and their organs removed for flow cytometric
analysis.

binding by mAb. Four-color analysis was performed using
a FACScalibur
(Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA). CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) was
used for analysis. Multicolor sorting was performed using
a FACStarplus.

4.5 Cell suspensions

Cell suspensions of thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph
nodes and liver were prepared as previously described [19].
Peritoneal exudate cells were isolated by filling the perito-
neal cavity with 10 ml PBS containing 5 % FCS and 0.02 %
azide, gently shaking the mouse and subsequently retrieving
as much fluid as possible. Lung tissue was cut into small
pieces and digested with collagenase D (Boehringer Mann-
heim Corp, Nunawading, VIC, Australia) for 45 min with
shaking at 37 °C until all tissue lumps were digested. Cells
were filtered through 100 ? m mesh, washed and resus-
pended prior to staining.

4.6 Cell enrichment

To enrich NKT cells from the thymus, CD8+ heat-stable anti-
gen (HSA)+ thymocytes were depleted by incubation with
anti-CD8 (clone 3.155) and anti-HSA (clone J11D) followed
by rabbit complement (C-six Diagnostics, Mecquon, WI).
Viable cells were recovered over Histopaque 1083 (Sigma
Chemical Co.), washed and surface labeled for flow cyto-
metric sorting. For spleen T cell enrichment, red blood cells
were removed using red cell lysis buffer (Sigma Chemical
Co.), B cells were depleted by labeling with anti-B220 (clone
RA3.6B2) and anti-HSA (clone M1/69) and incubated with
sheep anti
rat-IgG conjugated immunomagnetic beads
(Dynal Pty Ltd, Carlton, VIC, Australia). Bead-labeled cells
were magnetically removed and the remaining cells surface
labeled for flow cytometric sorting.

4.7 Flow cytometry

The following mAb were used in multiparameter flow cyto-
metric analysis: allophycocyanin-conjugated anti- §
g TCR
(clone H57–597), PE-conjugated anti-NK1.1 (clone PK136,
both purchased from Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), FITC-
conjugated anti-CD4 (clone CT-CD4), Tricolor-conjugated
anti-CD8 §
(clone CT-CD8, both purchased from Caltag Lab-
oratories, So. San Francisco, CA), biotinylated anti-CD8 g
(clone 53-5.8), biotinylated anti-CD69 (clone H1.2F3), FITC-
conjugated anti-Ly6C (clone AL-21), biotinylated anti-
CD45RB (clone 16A), FITC-conjugated anti-CD38 (clone 90),
anti-V g 8.1/8.2 (clone MR5-2), FITC-conjugated anti-DX5
(clone DX5)
(all purchased from Pharmingen). PE-
conjugated mouse IgG2a (anti-rat CD44, clone OX-49, Phar-
mingen) was used as an isotype control for anti-NK1.1-PE.
Biotinylated mAb were detected with streptavidin-FITC
(Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Anti-FcR (clone 2.4G2) and
normal mouse serum were used to prevent nonspecific

4.8 In vitro T cell stimulation

Flat-bottom 96-well microtiter plates were coated with
10 ? g/ml anti-mouse [clone KT3-1.1 or clone 145-2C11
(Pharmingen)] overnight at 4 °C in PBS. Wells were washed
twice with PBS before use. In most cases cells were cultured
at a density of 1 × 105 cells in 100 ? l tissue culture medium.
In some cases 0.5 × 105 cells were cultured/well, in these
instances the same number of each subset of NKT cells was
stimulated for direct comparison beetween the level of cyto-
kines produced. Supernatants were harvested at 18–20 h
and analyzed for cytokine production by ELISA. Cytokine
readouts for samples with 0.5 × 105 cells were adjusted to
cytokines produced per 105 cells.

4.9 Cytokine assays

IL-4 and IFN- + were detected by sandwich ELISA as
described previously [24]. Generally the limit of detection for
IL-4 was 2 U/ml, and IFN- + 0.1 ng/ml. Samples with unde-
tectable cytokine levels were assigned the lowest detectable
value.

4.10 Statistical analysis

Quantitative differences between samples were compared
with the Mann-Whitney U (rank sum) test.
