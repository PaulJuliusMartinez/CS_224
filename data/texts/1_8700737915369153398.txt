Index Terms-Base -2, positive-negative base conversion, twin carries.
Let a binary number b be represented by a in base -2. Dealing with -2 base up-down counter, Yuen' has given very simple methods for conversion from a to b and vice versa and the steps can be written as follows. Conversion from a to b
Step 1: EXCLUSIVE-OR **. 0 1 0 1 0 to a. Step 2: Subtract--. 0 1 0 1 0 from the previous result (in base
+2).
Conversion from b to a Step 1: Add ... 0 1 0 1 0 to b (in base +2). Step 2: EXCLUSIVE-OR * - - 0 1 0 1 0 to the previous result. These steps for conversion can be easily proved if we carefully
consider the value of a. Let a be represented by the bit pattern

But as the design of carrylook-ahead adders with positive twin carries is difficult, carrylook-ahead adders with positive and negative carries for 2-op-
erands [4] or 3-operands [1] must be utilized. Hence, for certain applications, a mixed structure of two types of adders [1], [2] will
be more useful.

+b to -b: Take B's complement of all odd index digits of i+b; subtract (in base -b arithmetic) the number * BOBOBO from the previous result. -b to +b: Add ... BOBOBO (again in base -b arithmetic) to i-b; take B's complement of all odd index digits. Proofs for these are similar to that given by Agrawal. These algorithms are interesting but are probably not of practical value, since base -b arithmetic is used. 3) Agrawal's comments about the relative merits of alternative approaches for base -2 arithmetic are technically valid, but academic, since I consider base -2 to be inferior to base +2 except

for special applications of the type suggested by Zohar [1]-43]. Future developments may well prove me wrong, and indeed I shall be most pleased if this happens.

The solution to the problem of counting of m X n matrices of zeros and ones under 1) row and columns permutations and 2) row and columns permutations together with columns complementations is given in Harrison's' paper. The first problem is more complicated than the second one, since the author claims the second is "an easy generalization" of the first.

O S j"<I
is imposed on the number S - j of the elements in a row of matrix under consideration in [1].
The main result of Harrison's paper follows from [1] as a particular case of I = k, where k is the length of the row.
It should be noted also, that [1] is mentioned in [2] (see Section III-H)
and is included in references to [2] as [567].
