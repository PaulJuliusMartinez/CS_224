Variable Rate Nitrogen Application on Corn Fields: The Role of Spatial Variability and Weather
Roland K. Roberts, S. B. Mahajanashetti, Burton C. English,* James A. Larson, and Donald D. Tyler
ABSTRACT
Meta-response functions for corn yields and nitrogen losscs were estimated froni EPICgenerated data for three soil types and three weather scenarios. These nleta~nodelswere used to cvnluate variable rate (VRT) versus uniform rate (URT) nitrogen application tcchnologies for- alternative weather scenarios and policy options. Except under very dry conditions, returns per acre for VRT were higher than for URT and the econornic advantage of VRT increased as realired rainfall decreased from expected average rainhill. Nitrogen losses Lo the environment h-orn VRT were lower for all situations examined. except on fields with little spatial variability.

Precision farming addresses site-specific crop needs within a field. Its component technologies enable farmers to understand the changing plant-growth environment across a field, estimate input requirements for I-elatively homogeneous slnaller-than-field-size units, and apply inputs on a site-specific basis. Claims are frequently made that precision farming enables farmers to enjoy greatel- econolnic ben-

Most studies have ignored the effects of variable rate input application on the environment ,Lowenberg-DeBoer; Swinton and Ahmed). Nevertheless, a few have addressed the potential impacts on environmental quality (e.g., Babcock and Pautsch, 1998; 'Thrikawala et al., 1999; Watkins et al., 1998). These studies showed the potential for VRT to improve net returns, reduce nitrogen usage, and positively impact groundwater quality.
The literature on precision farming also has largely ignored temporal yield variability (Lowenberg-DeBoer and Swinton). Fluctuating weather patterns can cause large variations in crop yields and far111 profits. When cropmanagement decisions are based on weather expectations that are different from realized weather conditions, farm protits could be reduced.
The driving hypothesis behind this research was that VRT improves profits relative t o URT and reduces negative environmental impacts resulting from unexpected weather conditions. These benefits would come through more efficlent placement of inputs acros4 tnanagement zones within a field. Another hypothesi4 was that the economic and environmental benefits of VRT are larger on fields with greater spatial variability. I n the context of this study, spatial variability was defined by the proportions of a field in each management zone. A field is more spatially variable when its area is more evenly divided among management zones and less spatially variable when its area is more uniformly distributed in one management zone (English, Roberts. and Mahajanashetti: Roberts, English, and Mahajanashetti).
The objectives of this study were 1) to examine the economic feasibility of using VRT for nitrogen application on corn fields under alternative spatial variability and weather scenarios when expected and realized rainfall are the same and when they are different, 2) to test the hypothesis that VRT provides environmental benefits, and 3) to evaluate the economic and environmental effects of policies that s u b s i d i ~ ethe use of VRT or encourage VRT use by restricting nitrogen use on corn. These objectives were addressed for farmers faced with three possible rainfall scenarios

making nitrogen application decisions on corn fields with differing amounts of spatial variability.
This paper examines differences in net revenue between VRT and URT when expected weather is different from realized weather. Risk would be an important element of a decision tool to help farmers make the VRT adoption decision if net revenues for these technologies were substantially different for different expected and realized weather conditions. The purpose of this research was to examine the magnitucles of these net revenue differences rather than to evaluate the effects of risk on the decision to adopt VRT.
Methods
Theorrticul Model
Methods used in this study for economic analysis are similar to those of Roberts. English, and Mahajanashetti who evaluated fields with two management zones. Their methodology is extended to multiple management zones.
Optimal return above nitrogen cost per acre for a field using VRT (R?,,) can be expressed as a profit function (Nicholson):
where hi is the proportion of the field in man-
agement zone i , such that C y , X, = I : PCis the
corn price ($/bu); P,, is the nitrogen price ($1 Ib); N;6 is the economically optimal nitrogen rate applied to management zone i (Iblacre); and Y , ( N T ) is corn yield (bulacre) obtained
from applying N?.Alternatively, for URT the
optimal return above nitrogen cost per acre for the field (Kc,-,.) can be expressed as the following profit function:
where h, i \ as defined in equation 1 ; N:, is the economically optimal uniforrn nitrogen application rate (lblacre) obtained from a field average yield re\pon\e f'ut~ction that is a

Results
Table I presents the estimated corn yield response functio~isfor Collins, Mernphis and Loring soils under Rainfall Scenarios I, 11, and 111. The linear and quadratic coefficients for all equations had the expected signs and the asymptotic standard errors were low relative to the magnitudes of the coefticients.

The response functions for both Collins and Memphis soils changed little between Rainfall Scenarios I and 11, suggesting that the lower rainfall associated with Rainfall Scenario I1 did not reduce yields substantially on these soils. Alternatively. the lower moistitre :rssociated with Rainfall Scenario I11 lowered corn yields relative to Rainfall Scenarios 1 and 11 as reflected in more negative cluadratic coefficients in the response functions and lower platcaii yields.
The linear and quadratic coefficients of the yield response functions and the yield plateaus suggest that yields were lower at each nitrogen fertilization rate for the shallow Loring soil than for the deep Collins and Memphis soils. I n addition, yields for the Loring soil were reduced for Rainfall Scenario I 1 relative to Rainfall Scenario I and reduced substantially more for Rainfall Scenario 111. As expected. these yield redi~ctivns were considerably greater than the yield reductions for the Collins and Mcrrlphis soils.
The yield estimates proviciecl by EPIC were higher than county average yields observed in thc West Tennessee region, which range from 1 10 to 135 bushels per acre (Tennessee Department of Agriculture). The Rainfall Scenario I yield plateaus estimated for all three soils exceeded these averages. However, the yield estimates provided by EPIC did not specifically account for Inany yield-inhibiting factors that reduce county average corn yields; for example, species competition. pockets of poor drainage, and poor farm management. Also. the analysis did not account for other less-productive soils it1 the region that are used for corn production. After reviewing the EPIC output, the aiithors believe that the yield-nitrogen response reflected in the EPIC data was similar to the expected response for these soils. However, in comparing the EPIC data to other data series, the yield plateau for the Memphis soil probably should be lower for most situations. The Memphis soil assumed for this analysis was extremely well drained with a deep sooting zone. On the other hand, because of its shallow rooting zone, the corn production capacity of the Loring soil is greatly dirninished without adequate rainfall. As

expected, the Loring soil performed poorly under drought conditions in the EPIC simulations.
The estimated nitrogen loss functions (Table 2 ) h:~d intercepts th:~t were close to zero and most were not significantly different from zero, suggesting that little nitrogen carry-over existed from year to year for these Loess derived soils. The applied fertilizer nitrogen (N) coefficients were all positive and significantly different from zero as expected. For the deep Collins and Memphis soils, the effect on nitrogen loss from reduced water flow outweighed the effect from reduced plant uptake causing the N coefficients to decline from Rainfall Scenario I to Rainfall Scenario 111. For the shallow Loring soil the N coefficients are much larger than for the other soils because of less plant uptake associated with lower yields at each nitrogen fertilization rate (Table 1). Also. the N coefficients for the Loring soil increased with reduced rainfall because yields and plant uptake declined substantially. offsetting the effect of reduced water flow.
Whcn farmers expected average rainfall and average rainfall occurred, RVRT was greater than C for 2 2 of 63 fields (Table 3). The lower and upper SBVPs for Memphis and Loring soils, given different proportions of the tield in Collins soil are reported in Table 4. When a field was 70 percent or more Collins soil, R V K T was not greater than C for any combination of Memphis and Loring soils (Table 3, fields 55-63; Table 4, row headed 70). As Collins soil increased from 0 to 60 percent, the lower SBVPs for Loring soil decreased only slightly Rom 33 to 31 percent, while the upper SBVPs for Me~nphissoil decreased silbst:untially (Table 4). Furthermore, when a field contained only Collins and Memphis soils in any proportions (Table 3. fields 19. 28. 36, 43, 49, 54, 58, 61, and 63), RVRT was estimated at zero. Also, given a positive percentage of a tield in Loring soil. variation in the proportions of Collins and Memphis soils changed RVRT only slightly (eg., Table 3. fields 8, 17, 26, 34. 41, 47, 52, 56, and 59).

How from the similarity in the marginal physical products of the Collins and Memphis yield response functions in Table 1. Results suggest that fields containing these three soil types have two rather than three management zones, one being a combination o f Collins and Memphis soils and the other containing Loring soil.
The lower SBVPs for Loring soil (Table 4) indicate that fields had to contain more than 31 to 33 percent Loring soil for RVRT to be greater than C (Table 3. compare fields 6-7, 15-16, 24-25. 32-33, 39-40, 45-46 and 5051, and see tield 55). The lower SBVPs for Mernphis soil added to the percentage of Col-

lins soil in the row headings of Table 4 indicate that tields had to contain more than 22 to 24 percent Collins andlor Memphis soils for VRT to be more profitable than URT. The upper SBVPs for Memphis soil added to the percentage of Collins soil in the row headings of Table 4 indicate that a tield had to contain less than 67 to 69 percent Collins ancllor Memphis soils for VRT to be more profitable than URT.
Results in Table 3 show that VRT required larger amounts of fertilizer nitrogen per acre than URT as indicated by positive NADs. The exceptions occurred in fields with only Collins and Memphis soils, which had NADs of zero.

NAD (Nitrogen Application Difference), and N1.D (Nitrogen Loss Difference). ' RVRTS lera than the custom charge ($3.00/acre) are shown in bold.

Furthermore. the NADs increased with the proportion of a field in Loring soil up to 60 percent Loring soil ;and declined thereafter.
The NADs were higher for VRT than for URT because of differences in the marginal physical products of the Loring versus the Collins and Memphis soils in going from the tield average optimal nitrogen rate to the optimal nitrogen rates for each soil. Using Field

23 (20-30-50) as an example (Table 3), the optimal nitrogen rate for the field average function was 187.97 Iblacre while the optimal rates for the Collins, Memphis, and Loring soils were 209.45, 208.24, and 169.39 Iblacre, respectively. Subtracting these optimal rates from the tield average optimal rate gives an increase in nitrogen use of 2 1.48 and 20.27 Ib/ acre for Collins and Memphis soils, respec-

tively. and a decrease in nitrogen use of 18.58 Iblacr-e for the Loring soil. Weighting these changes by the proportions of the field in each soil gives a field average increase in nitrogen use for VRT compared to URT of 1.08 I b/acre.
Even though more nitrogen was applied with VRT than with URT, less nitrogen was lost to the environment (NLD). indicating that the VRT nitrogen rates were more in line with efficient crop production. In addition, the shallow Loring soil was more susceptible to nitrogen loss than were the Collins and Memphis soils as reflected in the N coefficients in Table 2. Those coefficients indicate that a larger portion of the change i n applied nitrogen, i n going from URT to VRT, was lost to the environmenl for the Loring soil (0.422 Ib lostllb appliedlacre) than for the Collins (0.0321 Ib lostllb appliedlacre) and Memphis (0.0473 Ib lostllb appliedlact-e)soils.
Results suggest that the amount of nitrogen lost to the environment could be reduced between two and four Iblacre by profit-maximizing farmers who atlopl VRT, with the greatest

benefit occurring on fields with around 50 percent Loring soil regardless of the percentages of a field in Collins and Memphis soils. In addition, nitrogen lost to the environment could be reduced by about two or three Iblacre by farmers with marginal fields (Fields 2, 7, 1 1 . 16, 20. 25, 33, 40, 46, 51, and 55) if they could be induced to adopt VRT.
Table 5 presents the results when farmers make decisions based on Rainfall Scenario I response f ~ ~ n c t i o nbsu,t the response functions for Rainfall Scenario I1 are realized. Patterns in RVRT and NLD were similar to those reported when average rainfall was expected and realized (Table 3). In this case. however, the lower SBVPs for Loring soil (Table 4) varied slightly more (ranging between 14 and 22 percent) than when Rainfall Scenario 1 was realized, reflecting more divergent yield response functions for Collins and Memphis soils (Ta-
