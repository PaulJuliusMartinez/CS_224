Summary: We examined the effectiveness of 33 U.S.-based HIV intervention studies in reducing the sexual risk behaviors of drug users by reducing unprotected sex or increasing the use of male condoms. The studies, identified as of June 1998, through the HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis project, were published in 1988 or later, measured behavioral or biologic outcomes, used experimental designs or certain quasiexperimental designs, and reported sufficient data for calculating an effect size for sexual risk reduction. Of the 33 studies, 94% recruited injection drug users; 21% recruited crack users. The mean age of participants was 36 years. Almost all studies were randomized (94%), provided another HIV intervention to the comparison groups (91%), and evaluated behavioral interventions (91%). On average, interventions were conducted in 5 sessions (total, 10 hours) during 4.5 months. Interventions compared with no interventions were strong and significant (k  3; odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43­0.85). Interventions compared with other HIV interventions showed a modest additional benefit (k  30; OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81­1.03). When we extrapolated our result (an OR of 0.60) to a population with a 72% prevalence of risk behavior, the proportion of drug users who reduced their risk behaviors was 12.6% greater in the intervention groups than in the comparison groups. Our meta-analysis shows that interventions can lead to sexual risk reduction among drug users and justifies providing interventions to drug users. Developing interventions with stronger effects to further reduce sexual risk behaviors among drug users must remain a high priority. Key Words: HIV infection--AIDS--HIV risk behavior--Sex behavior--Injection drug users--Drug users--Substance abuse--Meta-analysis.

In the United States, drug users, both injection and noninjection drug users, continue to be at risk for HIV infection although many drug users have adopted safer sexual and drug use behaviors during the past decade

(1­3). In the absence of a vaccine to prevent HIV infection or a cure for HIV/AIDS, HIV risk reduction interventions are an important tool to reduce the risk for HIV infection among drug users (4). This is especially important because results of HIV epidemic surveillance, intervention research, and modeling indicate that drug users are at risk for HIV infection (5­7). Although interventions with drug users aim primarily to protect drug users from getting infected with HIV, these interventions have an indirect benefit of protecting the partners and the children of drug users. HIV prevalence among drug users remains relatively high, and a high proportion of drug users engage in sexual contact with uninfected people (5,6).

Estimates from the mid-1990s in the United States indicate that 80% of HIV-infected adult heterosexuals who do not inject drugs have been infected through sexual contact with HIV-infected injection drug users (8). Many injection drug users become infected through unsafe drug use and transmit HIV infection to their partners through unprotected sex (9­13). The use of noninjection drugs such as crack and methamphetamine is also associated with HIV infection because the use of these drugs increases the risk for unsafe sex behaviors (14­18).
Although national estimates of HIV infection and AIDS cases are reported for injection drug use, similar data are not reported for noninjection drug use. In addition, it is rather difficult to assess the total number of cases associated with injection drug use that are attributed to unsafe sexual behaviors as opposed to unsafe drug use. Since the epidemic began, injection drug use has directly and indirectly accounted for more than one third (36%) of AIDS cases in the United States (19). Of the 46,400 new cases of AIDS reported in 1999, 13,833 (30%) were associated with injection drug use (19). Of these 13,833 cases, 13% were among female sex partners of injection drug users, and 1% among their children (19). Cumulative data from 36 states and areas with confidential HIV infection reporting show that 19,720 (15%) of 128,289 cases of HIV infection reported through June 2000 were attributed to injection drug use, and 21,143 (16%) were attributed to heterosexual contact. Of these 21,143 cases, 5375 cases were attributed to sex with an injection drug user, and 14,358 were attributed to sex with an HIV-infected person whose risk behavior was not specified (19).
Evaluations of specific U.S.-based intervention studies that aimed to reduce HIV drug- and sexual risk behaviors and infection rates among drug users, along with narrative reviews of these studies, show larger reductions in drug risk behaviors than in sexual risk behaviors, or provide evidence of reductions in seroconversion rates (20­ 27). While these studies and reviews provide strong evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions on drug use behaviors, they provide ambiguous evidence of the extent and magnitude of reductions in sexual risk behaviors among drug users (28­30). Although qualitative reviews provide evidence of sexual risk reduction--e.g., Needle et al. (3) and Gibson et al. (29)--many individual studies showed no differences between the experimental and comparison groups (1).
However, the only meta-analysis published to date showed a statistically significant moderate average effect size for sexual risk reduction (participation in the experimental group was associated with greater sexual risk

reduction). Given the mixed results of qualitative reviews and individual studies, the result from this previous meta-analysis may seem unexpectedly favorable. However, that result may be exaggerated because that meta-analysis included studies with relatively weak designs. More specifically, that meta-analytic review of 16 U.S.-based studies, published between 1990 and 1995, of various study designs, including seven studies that had a one-group, pre-post intervention design, showed that drug users increased their condom use (the overall weighted average effect measured as a standardized mean difference was 0.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33­0.46; and as an odds ratio was 0.49; 95% CI, 0.44­ 0.54) (31). Because the evidence for intervention effects is weaker when studies with one-group, pre-post intervention studies are included in a meta-analysis (31), there is a need to reconcile the results of individual studies, qualitative reviews, and the one previous metaanalysis. It is in this situation of conflicting and ambiguous results that a meta-analysis of studies with strong research designs can be particularly helpful. Restricting our meta-analysis to studies with only rigorous designs offers stronger confidence in attributing the observed effects to the interventions rather than to other factors (32,33). Understanding the effects of interventions is important to identify effective interventions for wide implementation in program settings and to provide insight into accomplishments and future directions in the development of intervention studies with drug users.
The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of intervention studies conducted with drug users (injection or noninjection) in the United States for reducing their sexual risk for HIV infection by conducting a meta-analysis of 33 studies identified as of June 1998. Our meta-analysis included studies published in 1988 or later and included only intervention studies that used either experimental or certain quasi-experimental designs.
METHODS
The database of the HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis (PRS) project was the source for studies in this analysis (34). The PRS project, initiated in October 1996, by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, maintains a cumulative database of HIV prevention intervention studies (34,35). Because of the time it takes to identify, acquire, and review studies, this meta-analysis includes studies identified as of June 30, 1998. Thus, our meta-analysis includes studies published between 1988 and 1996 and a few studies published in 1997 or later. We provide in the discussion section a qualitative review of the studies reported since the cut-off point for our metaanalysis.

HIV PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS FOR DRUG USERS

S75

Although the time period covered in our meta-analysis overlaps with the time period of the previous meta-analysis (31), our study differs in important acquisition and analytic criteria that provide more confidence in understanding the extent of sexual risk reduction among drug users.
We used three search strategies to identify the studies for the PRS project and thus for inclusion in this article (34). Searches were conducted in eight electronic databases (AIDSline, Medline, Healthstar, PsychInfo, Sociofile, Educational Resources Information Center, the Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health, and Dissertation Abstracts). Manual searches included hand searching of 53 key journals, relevant books, reports, and reference lists. In addition, the PRS team networked with researchers, research institutions, and funding agencies to locate studies.
We used four a priori inclusion criteria, related to scope, outcome measurement, methodologic rigor, and calculation of effect size, in selecting studies for this meta-analysis (34,35). The scope criteria for the U.S.-based behavioral and social studies refer to a focus on HIV/AIDS prevention, the use of behavioral risk reduction as a means of prevention, and to a report or publication date as early as 1988 (36). By our definition, behavioral intervention studies must have targeted individual-level sexual and drug risk behaviors. Social intervention studies included, in addition, explicit and direct attempts to create risk-reduction changes in peer or community norms. Intervention studies with drug users were defined as those in which the primary behavioral risk for HIV infection for most (> 50%) study participants was related to injection drug use (i.e., heroin, cocaine, and other drugs) or to noninjection drug use (i.e., crack cocaine, alcohol, and other drugs).
Second, to meet criteria for outcome measurement, evaluation data must have been collected on at least 1 of 20 specified HIV-related behavioral outcomes (sexual or drug risk behaviors or HIV antibody testing) or 10 biologic outcomes (HIV, other STDs, and hepatitis B and C) (Appendix A).
Third, the study designs must have been rigorous, defined as experimental designs or certain quasi-experimental designs. In studies with experimental designs, individuals, groups, or communities were randomly assigned, and at least post-intervention data were collected. In studies with quasi-experimental designs, the method of assignment was unbiased, not random, pre- and post-intervention data were collected, and the report stated that the groups were not statistically different at baseline or that baseline differences had been controlled statistically (34,35). While the term "control group" is often used to refer to the other study group in experimental designs and the term "comparison group" is used to refer to the other study group in quasi-experimental designs, we use the term "comparison group" in this article to refer to the other study group in both types of designs.
Fourth, data must have been sufficient to allow calculation of the intervention effect on reducing sexual risk behaviors of drug users by reducing unprotected sex or by increasing the use of male condoms.
Pairs of trained research scientists coded and extracted the data pertaining to the inclusion criteria, the descriptive variables (general, population, research, and intervention), and the sexual risk outcome variables. To extract the data, the PRS team used standardized coding books and coding forms developed for the project (34). The training and the regular supervision of coders were accompanied by coding by two coders and by a routine for identifying and resolving discrepancies to ensure the reliability and the validity of data extraction. The definitions used in abstracting and coding, including the use of mutually exclusive or multiple categories, appear as footnotes to the tables. The source of the data for the descriptive variables and for calculating the intervention effect on sexual risk reduction appears as the first footnote in Appendix B. For studies with multiple follow-up evaluations, we analyzed the first follow-up data reported for sexual risk reduction.

Behavioral Outcome Construct for Sex Risk Reduction
We used a behavioral outcome construct consisting of two outcome variables (reducing unprotected sex acts or increasing the use of male condoms) to assess reductions in unsafe sex behaviors. We established a hierarchy for selecting data on unprotected sex in the two studies that reported data on both outcomes (Appendix B: studies 15 and 16).
Consistent with the definitions used and data reported in the studies, the denominator for the variable measuring unprotected sex included all respondents in the study: people who were sexually abstinent, people who had only nonpenetrative sex, people who used a condom at least sometimes during penetrative sex (vaginal or anal), and people who did not use a condom during penetrative sex. The denominator for the condom use variable included only those who had penetrative sex (those who used a condom at least sometimes during penetrative sex and those who did not use a condom during penetrative sex). When studies reported sexual risk reduction by using a sexual risk index that included, for example, condom use along with other sex-related variables such as number of sex partners, we labeled and treated this index as a measure of unprotected sex because it was consistent with the definition used for unprotected sex. We used the framework developed by Sheeran and Abraham (37) to describe the sexual risk variables (outcome variable, response alternatives, recall period, partner relationship, type of sex and sexual activity) (Appendix D). We were not able to assess sexual risk reduction as measured by biologic outcomes because none of the studies included in the meta-analysis reported incidence rates for HIV infection or other STDs.
Analytic Strategy
Our assessment includes 1) a meta-analysis of the overall effect of the intervention studies on sexual risk reduction, as assessed by the behavioral outcome construct we used, 2) stratified analyses to examine whether the effects of the intervention studies differed across subgroups of studies, 3) a cumulative chronologic meta-analysis to identify the first year in which a statistically significant effect for all studies was established, and 4) sensitivity analyses for the variables that could influence the magnitude and significance of intervention effects, including the outcomes used in the construct and several inclusion criteria. Appendix E provides details on the analytic strategy used in our work.
Because of the differing statistical techniques and metrics used to assess intervention effects, we standardized the assessment metric for this meta-analysis by converting the metric used in each study to an odds ratio (and 95% CI).
Well-established, standard formulas were used in this process (38­ 44), and details of the procedures used in our calculations appear in another report in this issue (41). An odds ratio of less than 1 indicates fewer unsafe sexual behaviors in the intervention groups than in the comparison groups, and an odds ratio of more than 1 indicates fewer unsafe sexual behaviors in the comparison groups than in the intervention groups. We further extrapolated the overall effect into an estimate of risk difference (also called attributable risk) and relative risk difference (41,43) to a population with a prevalence of risk behaviors of 72%. Our choice of this estimate of risk behavior was based on baseline data collected in several cities during the period (late 1980s and early 1990s) the studies were conducted (45­47).
We used a random-effects model to calculate an overall weighted average effect (also as an odds ratio) for the behavioral construct for all intervention studies (38­40). We calculated a homogeneity statistic (the Q statistic), and conducted stratified analysis to examine whether the overall effect differed across subgroups of the studies (48,49). We first

stratified studies by whether interventions were provided to the comparison groups. The effect size for the 30 studies that provided interventions to the comparison groups was hypothesized to be smaller than that for the three studies that did not (50). In the first group of studies, the overall weighted average effect size was an estimate of relative effects because it reflected the difference in the effects of two different interventions. In the second group of studies, the overall weighted average effect size was an estimate of an absolute effect because it reflected the effect of one intervention. We conducted additional stratified analyses (subgroup analyses) in the group of 30 studies that provided interventions to the comparison groups, but not in the group of 3 studies that did not provide interventions to the comparison groups because the number of studies in this group was so small.
For the sensitivity analyses, we calculated the effect for a certain subgroup of studies by excluding from the total set of studies the studies with characteristics that could influence the overall intervention effect. We then compared the overall effect obtained for all the studies with the effect obtained for the subgroup of studies to determine whether the overall effect for all 33 studies was influenced by the studies that were excluded.
RESULTS
Yield of Literature Search and Study Selection
The overall yield was 89 U.S.-based, behavioral and social HIV risk-reduction intervention studies with drug users that were published in 1988 or later (34). Of these 89 studies, 7 (8%) collected data on psychosocial variables only and did not collect evaluation data on any of the behavioral or biologic outcomes pre-specified by the PRS project. Of the remaining 82 studies that collected evaluation data on at least one of the pre-specified behavioral or biologic outcomes, 48 (59%) used research designs specified in our methodologic rigor criteria. Of the 48 studies that met all three criteria (scope, outcome measurement, and methodologic rigor), 33 (69%), reported in 17 reports (Appendix B), provided sufficient data to allow calculation of an effect size for the behavioral outcome construct on sexual risk. One report (Appendix B: studies 17­32) provided data for 16 studies. These 16 studies, representing half of the studies in our meta-analysis, were from a single very large multisite project, the National AIDS Demonstration Research (NADR) Project. The other 17 studies in our metaanalysis represented a variety of research efforts. (See Appendix C for a list of the reports and the reasons the data for 15 studies were insufficient for the calculation of an effect size for the sexual risk construct.)
Descriptive Results
There were few substantial differences between the 33 studies that were included and the 15 studies that were not included in the meta-analysis (Table 1). Here

we briefly describe the 33 studies included in the meta-analysis.
Most (88%) of the 33 intervention studies were published between 1991 and 1996, and all studies received only federal funding. More than two thirds (69%) of the studies were conducted in the Northeast (39%) or in the West (30%). Only three studies did not include female drug users, and all studies included participants who were members of a racial or ethnic minority group. The mean age of participants in the studies was 36 years. Most of the studies recruited injection drug users (94%), and almost one quarter (21%) recruited crack users.
Almost all (94%) of the studies used experimental designs, most (88%) used the individual as the unit of assignment, and most (70%) collected follow-up data 6 or more months after the intervention ended. Almost all (91%) of the studies had comparison groups that received an intervention (All the interventions offered to the comparison groups were HIV-related). The mean number of participants was 986, and the median was 411.
Only two studies evaluated social interventions and only one third (33%) of the studies reported the theoretical basis of the intervention. In terms of intervention content, information on HIV infection and HIV risk reduction was reported in 67% of the studies. The next three most common content categories were referrals (39%; e.g., to drug treatment); technical skills, with practice (39%; e.g., in condom use or needle cleaning); and services (33%; e.g., provision of HIV counseling and testing). The most common settings for intervention delivery were HIV/AIDS venues (18%; e.g., project field office or drop-in center, HIV counseling and testing center) and health care settings (15%; e.g., drug treatment center, health clinic). Of the reports reviewed, 46% did not specify the setting. The interventions were conducted, on average, in 5 sessions (total, 10 hours), during 4.5 months. In a high proportion of the reports reviewed, the data on number of sessions (48%), number of hours (82%), and time span for intervention delivery (73%) were insufficient or missing.
The measures used to assess the sexual outcome variables differed (Appendix D). Twenty-seven studies reported data on unprotected sex, and six reported data on the use of male condoms. In the 27 studies that assessed unprotected sex, 7 used a single variable, and 20 used an index to assess this outcome. Data on several of the sexual outcome measures were missing, ranging from 21% for sexual activity to 94% for partner relationship.
Meta-analytic Results
The overall weighted average effect size for the 33 studies was protective and significant (OR, 0.86; 95%

l "Control" is the term used for studies with experimental designs. "Comparison" is the term used for studies with quasi-
experimental designs. m Includes an HIV/AIDS-related intervention, an HIV/AIDS standard of care or minimal intervention, or an intervention not
related to HIV/AIDS (one study). All studies included in the meta-analysis provided a HIV/AIDS-related intervention. n Includes studies with multiple groups, one of which did not receive any intervention. o Studies were categorized into three mutually exclusive categories based on what was used in developing the intervention for
either the treatment group or the comparison group. Studies were categorized as having used a theory or a model when the
authors described, named, or provided a reference for at least one theory or model. Studies were categorized as having used
theoretical principles when authors mentioned the use of some theoretical input in the development of the intervention, but did
not describe, name, or provide a reference for a theory or a model. p Multiple responses are permitted. q The data for the intervention variables (content, setting, sessions, hours, and time span) represent the information for the
theoretically strongest treatment group, specified usually by the author or as determined on the basis of the theory used or
hypotheses examined. Otherwise, it is the first intervention group described by the author. r Content refers to the substance of the intervention delivered to the participants. Information refers to facts and concepts about

CI, 0.76­0.98) (Fig. 1). This effect size indicated that drug users in the intervention groups were more likely than those in the comparison groups to reduce their sexual risk behaviors. The effect size was also heterogeneous (Q  59.17; p  .002), indicating that the effect size differed by subgroups of studies.
We conducted stratification analysis to assess the sources of heterogeneity (Table 2). Studies with comparison groups that did not receive an intervention showed a significantly stronger effect (k  3; OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43­0.85) than did studies with comparison groups that received an HIV prevention intervention (k  30; OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81­1.03). The effects for the two groups of studies were statistically different; emphasizing the difference in interpreting the results for these two sets of studies.
Although the odds ratio for all 33 studies was small, the odds ratio for the three studies in which the comparison groups did not receive an intervention was moderate, and the odds ratio for the 30 studies in which the comparison groups received an intervention was weak and not significant. These results were also echoed when extrapolating the results (as measured by the odds ratios) to the additional number and proportion of people in the

intervention groups who reduced their risk behaviors compared with those in the comparison groups who did so. For all 33 studies, 210 more people in the intervention groups, out of 7146 people, reduced their unsafe sex behaviors (moved to a lower risk category) after the intervention compared with people in the comparison groups. These numbers translated into a risk difference of 2.9% and into a relative risk difference of 4.1% (210 more people out of 5145 people at risk at baseline in the intervention groups).
For the three studies that did not offer an intervention to the comparison groups, 121 more people in the intervention groups, out of 1331 people, reduced their unsafe sex behaviors compared with people in the comparison groups. These numbers translated into a risk difference of 9.1% and into a relative risk difference of 12.6% (121 more people out of 958 people at risk at baseline in the intervention groups).
Additional stratification analyses were conducted in the group of 30 studies that provided an intervention both to the intervention and the comparison groups. The summary effect obtained for studies whose participants used crack in addition to injecting drugs was statistically different from the effect obtained for studies whose partici-

and the confounding effects of these variables across studies with variables already used for stratification.
The characteristics of the interventions delivered to the intervention and to the comparison groups in the 30 studies that provided an intervention to both groups appear in Appendix F. One may notice the few differences in the characteristics of interventions provided to both study groups. Most interventions for both groups included various forms of information on how HIV is transmitted and included measures that people can take to reduce their risk for HIV infection. The only striking differences were in the durations (number of hours and sessions) of the interventions and the time spans over which they were delivered. Adding additional sessions or expanding these interventions did not appear to meaningfully increase the effect of the interventions. The characteristics of the interventions in the 3 studies that did not provide an intervention to the comparison groups also appear in Appendix F.
Of the 33 studies included in the meta-analysis, four studies (Appendix B, studies 4, 7, 10, and 14) had a significant protective effect (Fig. 1). See Appendix G for their characteristics. These four studies did seem to have unique characteristics that describe them and did not seem to have characteristics that make them different from the studies that did not have a significant effect.

For the chronologic meta-analysis, as of 1995, the overall weighted, average effect size became positive and statistically significant (k  26; OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75­0.99) (Fig. 2). Beginning in 1995, this positive and significant effect remained consistent.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess whether methodologic differences among the studies were associated with differences in intervention effects (Table 3). The magnitude, significance, and heterogeneity of the overall effect were not influenced by several inclusion criteria: 1) the sexual outcome variables (unprotected sex versus condom use) used in the construct; 2) the number of intervention groups in a study (two groups versus more than two groups); and 3) whether studies reported data for unprotected sex or the use of male condoms or both. The studies that used nonrandom assignment and the studies in which the unit of assignment was either the group or the community and for which we could not correct the variance of the effect size had a significant effect that was significantly different from the effects obtained for their counterpart studies.
DISCUSSION
Our results show that interventions can lead to meaningful sexual risk reduction among drug users. This is

seen most clearly in the studies that did not offer an intervention to the comparison groups because in these studies measurement of effects of the interventions was not obscured by other HIV interventions delivered to the comparison groups. The studies that did not offer an intervention to the comparison groups showed a moderate effect in sexual risk reduction (k  3; OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43­0.85). The one previous meta-analysis of changing the sexual risk behaviors of drug users that included seven studies that used a one-group pre-post intervention design, also showed a moderate and relatively similar favorable effect (k  16; OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.44­0.54) (31). (Studies with one-group pre-post designs were excluded from our synthesis.) These two effect sizes, as quoted here, suggest that moderate effects can be obtained from interventions aimed at reducing the sexual risk behaviors of drug users.
When we extrapolated our result (an OR of 0.60) to a population with a 72% prevalence of risk behavior, the proportion of drug users who reduced their risk behaviors was 12.6% greater in the intervention groups than in

the comparison groups. Given the importance of reducing sexual risk behaviors among drug users and the likelihood that the moderate effects we obtained are costeffective (51), our results justify providing intervention programs to drug users at risk for the sexual transmission of HIV. The results call for researchers, program providers, and policy makers to work together to make the interventions available to drug users and to convert the research interventions into materials for use in program settings (52,53).
The stratified analysis (by whether an intervention was or was not provided to the comparison group), that we were able to conduct in our meta-analysis, permits reconciliation of the mixed results reported previously on the extent of sexual risk reduction among drug users. Our results showed that studies in which both the experimental and the comparison groups received an HIV-related intervention had a small nonsignificant average effect size. Studies that did not provide an intervention to the comparison groups had a strong, significant effect. The previous reviews had concluded that drug users had re-

duced their sexual risk behaviors, although a large number of studies showed no differences between the intervention groups and the comparison groups in the sexual risk behaviors reported at follow-up. Thus, collectively, our results tell us that drug users reduced their sexual risk behaviors in response to HIV risk-reduction interventions. Our results also tell us that most interventions did not produce a significantly stronger effect than the other interventions offered in studies that provided interventions to both the experimental and the comparison groups.
In the studies in which both the experimental and the comparison groups received an HIV-related intervention, the comparison group received a standard, or a minimal, intervention, while the experimental group received an enhanced, or a more extensive, intervention. It seems that providing interventions is superior to not providing any

intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors, but there is yet no basis for determining the most effective interventions. The results show that providing "something is better than nothing," but with our current set of interventions, "more of something is not necessarily better." Based on the descriptive data, there is a need to increase the difference in the theoretical basis of the interventions provided to both study groups and in the content of these interventions to have a larger additional effect.
Other potential explanations for the moderate effects we found is that the interventions provided may not have been needed by the drug users, the exposure to the interventions may have been insufficient, or that combining all drug users in a single analysis could obscure the interventions that are effective. None of the reports included information on the implementation of formative research or needs assessment to identify the intervention

JAIDS Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, Vol. 30, Suppl. 1, July 1, 2002

S84 S. SEMAAN ET AL.

content or duration needed for the target population before the intervention was developed and delivered. All 33 studies reported the intention to reduce drug and sexual risk behaviors, although they might not have been focused equally on both behaviors. Studies did not report separately the characteristics of the interventions (e.g., content, duration) to reduce drug risk as opposed to sexual risk. Accordingly, we could not relate the magnitude of sexual risk reduction to the characteristics of the interventions that focused on sexual risk reduction.
In addition, more than half the studies did not mention the theories, models, theorized factors, or mechanisms hypothesized to be associated with sexual risk reduction. Our results show a need for more specificity in conceptualizing interventions and in reporting and analyzing their effects. Because drug users are faced with reducing risk in two complex behaviors--drug and sexual risk behaviors--there is a need for interventions that address the specific needs of drug users. Recent reviews of reduction in sexual risk indicate that the rate of condom use with main partner is still low because the associated variables are personal, interpersonal, and social (54­57). Thus, developing and evaluating a variety of intervention strategies that address the needs of drug users, including the availability of, accessibility to, and retention in drug treatment, is important in further reducing sexual risk behaviors of drug users. The importance of interventions that meet the specific needs of drug users is clearly seen in the slightly larger effect of interventions for injection drug users who also smoked crack compared with interventions for injection drug users who did not smoke crack. Although this result may be a function of higher baseline sexual risks among injection drug users who also smoke crack (i.e., providing more risk to be reduced) (58), it suggests that interventions for injection drug users who smoke crack can be effective and that additional research in this area should be undertaken (59­61).
The variability and the incompleteness of reporting make it difficult to determine effectiveness of interventions among other subgroups of drug users. In order, for example, to assess the effects of the interventions with men who have sex with men and who inject drugs--an important subgroup that is affected by the epidemic-- studies need to include this group in intervention studies and to report data on drug and sexual risk behaviors among this population. Although another study in this issue examined the effects of intervention studies with men who have sex with men (62), we did not find studies that were specifically designed for men who have sex with men and who also use drugs (35). One possible line of investigation would be to consider drug users a het-

erogeneous group, in which subgroups have different prevention needs, rather than to design single interventions that meet the needs of all drug users.
Although this meta-analysis comprised 33 studies, which was approximately double the number of studies included in the previous meta-analysis (31), this number was small for certain analyses. Although we analyzed our set of 33 studies extensively, we were still unable to distinguish the effects of some important characteristics of the interventions, such as content and duration. Our overall analysis remains valid and points to the gaps in the literature, to the limitations of analytical techniques, and to the importance of exploring component-related questions in future studies, including future metaanalyses that include a larger number of studies. Therefore, we were not able to determine the effects of specific features of successful interventions because of the limited description provided on intervention characteristics, the small number of studies, and the observational, nonexperimental nature of meta-analysis. The data, however, provide some directions for intervention development.
From our experience and results, we suggest that information about HIV infection and HIV risk reduction and access to condoms and to HIV testing would be included with other components in intervention programs. Interventions that include cognitive information about HIV and AIDS, and that teach participants to preserve their health through interpersonal, personal, and technical skills, and that emphasize the development of new peer norms to reduce HIV risk behaviors seem to be important. These interventions should probably be provided in a face-to-face setting, with the opportunity to ask questions.
Other qualitative reviews have identified characteristics of effective interventions as those that have a strong content, are offered for an extended period, to stable and motivated drug users and address the stage of behavior change of drug users (29). Incorporating these concepts to future interventions is important. Future studies should examine various intervention characteristics separately and in combination to determine the characteristics that reduce risk and the minimum intervention needed to reduce risk.
Because statistical significance of the effect of an intervention or of a set of interventions is a function both of effectiveness and sample size, it seems important that the magnitude of the overall meta-analytic effect (modest, large) and its statistical significance (yes, no) be interpreted in this context. Our meta-analysis shows overall that behavioral and social interventions work and have an overall modest effect. The significance of the overall effect of these interventions is a function both of

HIV PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS FOR DRUG USERS

S85

the magnitude of the intervention effect and the sample size of each study, and is not necessarily a function of any single intervention or of the interventions that had a statistically significant result.
The cumulative meta-analysis echoes the same overall conclusions, showing a consistent significant modest effect since 1995. Thus, as a genre, behavioral and social interventions are important in reducing the sexual risk behaviors of drug users, although their effect has been modest. During the past few years, however, the emphasis has been shifting to using social-oriented interventions to augment behavioral risk-reduction interventions that have been individually focused and psychologically oriented (63­67). Such interventions would address the influences of other people on one's behavior and the effects of social structures and macro social factors (e.g., poverty, social marginalization, racism, lack of employment, and drug treatment opportunities) that perpetuate risk behaviors (63­67). It thus seems important that researchers conduct more of these types of interventions and examine their effectiveness. The behavioral and social interventions that have been reported since the cutoff point for our meta-analysis did not show a stronger effect for sexual risk reduction than the effect observed in our meta-analysis (for example, 68­73). Developing interventions with stronger effects must be a high priority for future research.
Although research (37) has shown that sexual risk measures, specifically condom use measures, are highly intercorrelated, researchers have pointed to the need for consensus on the most meaningful measures of sexual risk reduction (74,75). The PRS project underscores this need because standardized reporting will reduce the complexity of, and the time needed for, coding studies and will facilitate comparison across studies. Although qualitative and quantitative (meta-analysis) reviews need to deal with differences in measurement, quantitative reviews (assuming an adequate number of studies and more complete reporting) allow researchers to examine the effects associated with differences in outcome measurement.
More detrimental than variations among the measures for sexual outcome variables, is the incomplete reporting of outcome data in a high proportion of the reports reviewed. Authors should report whether they are influencing infection or transmission rates, and they should report the type of sexual activity, sexual orientation, and provide information on partner gender, type of relationship, and serostatus. Specificity in data collection and in reporting will allow for specificity in analysis, which will be useful in understanding intervention effects and in moving research results to program settings. Although

reviews of multiple reports on the same intervention study may provide some of the missing information on intervention characteristics, these additional reports may not provide all the missing data needed for meta-analysis or for program development. The use of a website to provide additional information on intervention studies will facilitate acquisition of information necessary for research and program. In their outcome reports, researchers need to provide the sources that others can use for additional information on their interventions and research designs. Researchers and journal editors need to emphasize the importance of reporting sufficient data for the calculation of effect sizes.
Our meta-analysis has several limitations, for which we provide the reasons and offer suggestions for future analyses. Our descriptive data are based on the information in a single report. Because a single report may not provide data on all the variables reviewed here, supplemental sources (e.g., additional reports about a study and author solicitation) could be used in future analyses to obtain additional information. Both attrition rates and intent-to-treat analysis have implications for evaluating intervention effects and for adopting and implementing interventions (41,76,77). The influence of attrition and intent-to-treat analysis on overall intervention effects could be examined in sensitivity analysis provided that data are reported on these factors. When data were reported on intent-to treat analysis, we used these data in our meta-analysis. We did not examine the influence of attrition on the effects of the interventions because attrition and differential attrition were typically not reported. To the extent that we did not include studies that were not published or reported because of nonsignificant results, underscores the modest overall effect we found. Our comprehensive search strategy was useful, however, in acquiring studies reported during the period covered in our meta-analysis. Neither stratified nor regression analyses were optimal because of the small number of studies overall, the small number of studies in specific strata, and the large number of variables associated with intervention effects. Because most studies had one follow-up data point and because reports of first follow-up data tend to be published sooner, we limited our analyses to the first follow-up data used for study evaluation. The maintenance of risk reduction is an equally important area for research and needs to be examined both in individual studies and in meta-analysis. There is a need to update our results and to examine other prevention research issues, such as the effects of U.S.-based behavioral and social interventions on drug-use behaviors and the effects of policy studies and international studies on sexual and drug-related risk behaviors.

In summary, this article highlights the accomplishments and the opportunities for developing new intervention studies with drug users. We need to continue to develop, refine, and evaluate risk-reduction interventions that will further reduce sexual risk behaviors and to transfer effective interventions to program settings.

a We use study to refer to an intervention research project and report to refer to the publication about the study. This distinction allowed us to avoid duplication in enumerating studies because some reports are of the same study and others are of multiple studies. Both descriptive (general, population, research, and intervention variables) and outcome data on sexual risk were included in one report, in the first publication that contained complete evaluation data, except as noted for four studies, for which the descriptive data were reported in the first publication of evaluation of the study and the outcome data for the meta-analysis were published later. We chose the later publication for abstracting the outcome data because the later publication reported either the outcome data that could be extracted or the outcome data for the complete study sample. For the four studies for which the descriptive and the outcome data were in two different reports, the report listed in the Appendix is the one in which the outcome data appeared and the reports listed in the footnotes below are the reports of the descriptive data.

APPENDIX E
Details of the Analytic Strategy
We chose the odds ratio as the metric for the overall effect because it is often used in evaluating public health and medical interventions and because most (76%) of the studies included in our analysis reported their data in a dichotomous format or as an odds ratio. In calculating the effect size for each study, we controlled for baseline differences in the outcome variable. As a result, the odds ratio represented the ratio of the odds that those in the intervention group reduced their risk (i.e., moved to a lower risk category) to the odds that those in the comparison group reduced their risk.
To estimate the risk difference and the relative risk difference, we used a baseline prevalence of sex risk based on data reported in the literature because many studies included in our analysis did not report baseline prevalence for the study population. The risk difference indicates the additional number and proportion of all persons in the intervention groups who reduced their risk behaviors in comparison to the number and proportion in the comparison groups who did so. The relative risk difference indicates the additional number and proportion of persons who were at risk at baseline (assuming that 72% of study participants were at risk) in the intervention groups who reduced their

risk behaviors, in comparison to the number and proportion in the comparison groups who did so.
All studies had one treatment and one comparison group except for two studies that had multiple groups. For the studies with multiple intervention groups (Appendix B, studies 13 and 33), we calculated the effect of the intervention that was theoretically strongest, as determined by the hypotheses examined in the studies, contrasted with the intervention least influenced by theory. We conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding these two studies from the pool of the 33 studies to determine whether the overall effect for all the studies was influenced by these two studies.
When the unit of assignment was the community or the group and the unit of analysis was the individual, we needed to adjust the variance of the effect size for that study to account for intraclass correlation, thus providing for a wider confidence interval. We made this correction for one study (Appendix B, study 4) but we could not make this correction for three other studies (Appendix B, studies 1, 14, and 33) because the parameters (e.g., number of clusters and numbers of individuals per cluster) needed for this variance correction were not reported. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine whether the overall effect for the 33 studies was influenced by the three studies that used the group or the community as the unit of assignment and for which we could not correct the variance of the effect size.

a Studies were categorized into three mutually exclusive categories based on what was used in developing the intervention for either the intervention group or the comparison group. Studies were categorized as having used a theory or a model when the authors described, named, or provided a reference for at least one theory or model. Studies were categorized as having used theoretical principles when authors mentioned the use of some theoretical input in the development of the intervention, but did not describe, name, or provide a reference for a theory or a model.
b Multiple responses are permitted. c The data for the intervention variables (content, setting, sessions, hours, and time span) represent the information for the theoretically strongest treatment group, specified usually by the author or as determined on the basis of the theory used or hypotheses examined. Otherwise, it is the first intervention group specified by the author. d Content refers to the substance of the intervention delivered to the participants. Information refers to facts and concepts about HIV infection, risk behaviors, and risk reduction. Perceived risk or vulnerability enhancement refers to perceptions of personal risk or vulnerability. Referrals refer to services that are not part of the intervention, e.g., drug treatment, social services. Responsibility enhancement refers to increasing self-perceived responsibility or anticipated guilt for one's behaviors. Risk reduction supples refer to items used in risk reduction, such as condoms and sterile needles. Self-esteem or group pride enhancement refers to increasing a positive self- or group-image or identity. Services refer to activities provided by the study and that may or may not be mandatory for participation in the study, such as case management, and psychological counseling. Interpersonal skills refer to abilities that involve interactions with other people, such as communication skills to assess partner's risk. Personal skills refer to abilities that are internal to the person, such as problem solving skills. Technical skills refer to abilities that are of a practical and applied nature, such as use of condoms. Social support enlistment refers to participants' recruitment of others to support their risk reduction activities. e Skills were differentiated on methods of delivery (with or without practice) for theoretical and analytical reason.
