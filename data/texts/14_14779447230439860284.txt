Abstract: This paper looks at several measures of competitiveness for the Japanese manufacturing sector relative to the United States over the period 1980-2000. Using industry-specific unit-value ratios (UVRs) we show that labour productivity in Japanese manufacturing lags considerably behind the U.S. and that the Japanese position has worsened during the 1990s. In 2000, value added per hour worked in Japanese manufacturing stood at 72 percent of the U.S. level after peaking at 79 percent in 1991. Underneath this aggregate estimate though, there is a wide range of branch-specific labour productivity levels. Japanese manufacturing has also suffered from rising unit labour cost levels. The long-term trend of a strengthening yen has eroded Japanese cost competitiveness in nearly all branches between 1980 and 2000, although ULC levels have declined somewhat from 1995 onwards due to a more favourable exchange rate development and moderate wage growth in Japan. Still, in 2000 unit labour cost in Japanese manufacturing was still 27 percent above the U.S. level. In comparison, in 1980 Japanese unit labour cost stood at only 82 percent of the U.S. le vel.

1. Introduction
Compared to the 1980s the economic growth experiences of the United States and Japan have reversed during the 1990s. Between 1980 and 1991 the average Japanese GDP growth rate was much higher than in the United States. However, since the stock market and housing bubble burst, the Japanese economy has limped from one recession to the other. At the same time, however, the U.S. economy has regained its strength. Especially since 1995, U.S. output and productivity growth has increased sharply led by the widespread adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Although the 2001 recession has dampened enthusiasm somewhat, the U.S. economy still looks to be in considerably better shape than the Japanese economy. Table 1 confirms the general trend with strong Japanese growth in the total economy before 1991, reviving U.S growth and sagging Japanese growth between 1991 and 1995 and strong U.S. growth after 1995.

A similar picture emerges for the manufacturing sector. During the 1980s Japanese output and productivity growth in manufacturing was much faster than in the U.S., leading to a continuous narrowing of the productivity gap relative to the U.S. But Japanese manufacturing output growth collapsed during the early 1990s while U.S. growth doubled. Indeed the U.S. manufacturing sector received a strong boost from technological progress in the ICT-producing industries.1 Although the manufacturing sector in advanced countries is generally characterized by stagnating or declining employment, Japanese employment declined at a much faster pace than in the United States. A closer look at the manufacturing sector may be particularly revealing from the point of view of international competitiveness.

1 See for example van Ark, et al. (2002) and references therein.

To accurately measure price competit iveness we calculate industry-specific purchasing power parities (PPPs) using the ICOP industry-of-origin approach.2 These PPPs are used to calculate relative labour productivity levels in 17 manufacturing branches for 1997 and the period 1980-2000. The PPP calculations show that, despite significant movements in the yen/dollar exchange rate, the relative manufacturing price level in Japan has been well above the U.S. since the mid-1980s. At the same time the manufacturing productivity gap between Japan and the U.S. has widened by 7 percentage points from 21 percentage points in 1991 to more than 28 percentage points in 2000.
We also look at cost competitiveness by calculating relative unit labour cost levels for the manufacturing sector. This indicator shows the relative cost of labour input to produce a unit of output in Japan compared to the United States. Relative unit labour cost over this period has been influenced by sharp fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate, which is used to convert Japanese labour cost to U.S. dollars. But in general the competitiveness of Japanese manufacturing products has suffered from a strengthening yen relative to the U.S. dollar, declining relative productivity levels and high labour cost levels. As a result Japanese output from nearly all branches is produced at higher unit labour cost than their U.S. counterparts.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section gives an overview of the ICOP methodology. In section 3 we will present the results of the 1997 benchmark comparison between Japan and the United States. This comparison covers the manufacturing sector as a whole and 17 manufacturing branches. Section 4 deals with the analysis of the Japan-U.S. labour productivity gap. Section 5 is devoted to the change in relative labour productivity levels in Japan versus the U.S.. In section 6, we report our estimates of unit labour cost levels and its development since 1987. Section 7 presents some conclusions.

2. Methodology

For this study, we calculate Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) following the industry-of-

origin approach as developed in the International Comparisons of Output and Productivity

(ICOP) project of the University of Groningen. The methodology has been used and

described in many studies, including van Ark (1993), Pilat (1994), van Ark and Pilat (1993)

and Timmer (2000). OECD (2003) covers this method extensively in a reader on measuring

productivity levels. Hence we limit ourselves to a summary description of the ICOP

methodology.

The aim of the ICOP method is to derive industry-specific currency conversion factors on the

basis of relative product prices. As a first step, unit values (uv) are derived by dividing ex-factory

output values (o) by produced quantities (q) for each product i in each country

2 See van Ark and Pilat (1993) for the previous benchmark ICOP comparison of Japanese manufacturing relative to the United States. See Jorgenson, Kuroda and Nishimizu (1987), Jorgenson and Kuroda (1990), Jorgenson and Kuroda (1992) or Kuroda (1996) for other estimates of Japan-U.S. productivity gaps. Van Ark and Timmer (2001), OECD (2003) extensively discuss some of the problems and advantages of the ICOP method.

The unit value can be considered as an average price, averaged throughout the year for all

producers and across a group of nearly similar products. Subsequently, in a bilateral comparison,

broadly defined products with similar characteristics are matched, for example ladies' shoes,

cigarettes, cheese and car tyres. For each matched product, the ratio of the unit values in both

countries is taken. This unit value ratio (UVR) is given by

UVRixu

=

uvix uviu

,

(2)

Here, x and u are the countries that are compared. The base country, in this case the U.S., is

denoted by u. The product UVR indicates the relative producer price of the matched product in the

two countries.

Product UVRs are used to derive UVRs at more aggregated levels in a stepwise procedure.

Within manufacturing, product UVRs are first aggregated to industries, then to branches and finally to aggregate manufacturing. 3 The industry UVR (UVRj) is given by the weighted average of the UVRs of the matched products. Product UVRs are weighted by their output value as more important

products should have a bigger weight in the industry UVR:

UVRj = wijUVRixju i

(3)

with i=1,.., Ij the matched products in industry j; wij = oij / o j the output share of the ith

commodity in industry j; and o j = i oij the total matched value of output in industry j. In bilateral

comparisons the weights of the base country (u) or the other country (x) can be used, which provide a

Laspeyres and a Paasche type UVR respectively. The geometric average of the Laspeyres and Paasche

indices, i.e. the Fisher index, is used when a single currency conversion factor is required. The next

aggregation step is made by using the gross output of industries to obtain an industry-weighted mean

of all industry UVRs in a branch, similarly to the aggregation from product to industry. Again gross

output weights from country base country u and the other country x can be used to arrive at Laspeyres

and Paasche index of the branch UVRs. The latter step is repeated for the final aggregation step from

branch level to the level of total manufacturing.

3. The Japan-U.S. 1997 Benchmark Comparison
3.1 Estimation of Unit Value Ratios (UVRs)
The benchmark comparison for Japan versus the U.S. was largely done on the basis of product information from the 1997 Economic Census for the U.S. and the Census of Manufacturers 1997 for Japan. Some secondary sources were also used such as a price survey for intermediate goods from MITI.4 Using these sources we arrive at a total number of 224 unit value ratios, which account for 19.5 percent of U.S. manufacturing output and 21.1 percent of Japanese manufacturing output. Table 2 gives an overview of the manufacturing branch UVRs and output coverage ratios. Coverage by

3 Within ICOP, the total manufacturing sector is subdivided into 14-16 more homogeneous branches (equal to the 2 digit ISIC level), which are subsequently subdivided into industries (equal to 3 or 4 digit ISIC level). 4 Appendix A contains details on the exact data used from the Census and other sources.

manufacturing branch differs significantly, mainly reflecting differences in the availability of product data. For example, in rubber and plastics coverage was only 5.9 percent and 7.5 percent for the U.S. and Japan respectively, but it was 74.9 percent and 49.3 percent for petroleum and coal products.5
For some manufacturing branches the UVR estimates deserve additional comment. First of all, the UVR for food products is among the highest in Japan, which has a large effect on the UVR for total manufacturing due to the importance of the branch. It is well known that agricultural products are much more expensive in Japan than in other countries such as the United States and that the market for food products is strongly protected. As agricultural products are an important input for the food products branch, the output price in this branch will automatically be much higher relative to the U.S., even though the (implicit) value added price is lower. As our value added PPPs are directly obtained from the gross output unit values, the former is upwardly biased when no account is taken of the relatively high price ratio of intermediate products (in this case, agricultural products). Van Ark and Pilat (1993) remedy this problem by applying a double deflation procedure to obtain their 1987 UVR for food products, which adjusts differences in output prices for differences in prices of intermediate inputs. Here we follow a similar procedure. We calculate an intermediate input PPP for food products using industry-specific PPPs from van Ark, Stuivenwold and Inklaar (2003) in combination with intermediate input shares from the 1997 Input/Output tables of the OECD Input/Output database. The PPP for agricultural products of 654 Yen/$ has an especially large effect on the results. We then combine the resulting intermediate input PPP of 412 yen/US$ and the gross output PPP of 294 yen/US$ to yield the double deflated PPP of 216 yen/US$ in Table 2.
5 If we would only have used data directly from the Census, the coverage percentage drops to 12.9 percent for the U.S. and 13.7 percent for Japan. The zero percent coverage in office, computing and accounting machinery is due to the use of a PPP from Gersbach and van Ark (1994), which does not cover a specific part of output of the branch.

Another important area of price measurement problems is accounting for quality differences, in particular for ICT goods such as computers and for cars. In a growing number of countries these quality improvements are accounted for by using hedonic price indices (Triplett, 1990 and forthcoming). Relatively less effort has been put into measuring quality differences across countries. For computers we make use of a detailed producer-based PPP for personal computers from a study by the McKinsey Global Institute in 1990, which is described by Gersbach and van Ark (1994), and updated by us to 1997 using hedonic producer price indexes for computers in Japan and the United States. Van Mulligen (2003) provides quality-adjusted PPPs for the automobile industry. Americans tend to drive larger and heavier cars so cars produced in the United States will tend to be on average more expensive. Van Mulligen (2003) estimates hedonic regressions to take these differences into account and we therefore use his hedonic PPP for automobiles.
The (Fisher) UVR for total manufacturing of 141 Yen per U.S. dollar is clearly above the exchange rate of 121 yen/dollar, which suggests a 15 percent higher producer price in Japanese manufacturing relative to the United States in 1997. However, large differences exist between the UVRs. For example, the wood products branch has a UVR of 264, while electrical machinery has a UVR of 99. The reliability of our UVR, measured by the coefficient of variation of the UVRs, also differs between branches. Food products, wood products and rubber and plastics all have relatively high coefficients of variation in comparison to other branches like basic metal products. As a result, the 5 percent confidence interval for the food processing (Laspeyres) UVR would be [117,316] while this interval is [118,142] for basic metal products. As no matches could be made for furniture and fixtures and miscellaneous manufacturing, the UVR for total manufacturing was used.
When compared to the exchange rate the UVRs can be seen as an indicator of price competitiveness. In branches where the UVR is above the yen/dollar exchange rate, the U.S. is more competitive on output price. Vice versa, a relatively low price level indicates Japanese competitive strength. Table 3 shows the relative price level, calculated as the UVR divided by the exchange rate. There are three branches where the Fisher UVR is below the exchange rate: rubber and plastics, machinery and equipment and electrical machinery. The low Japanese price level in rubber and plastics can be due to the lack of matches. With only four matches and a high coefficient of variation, the UVR is not very reliable. For the other two branches, however, there are more matches and the coefficient of variation is lower.

3.2 Comparative Labour Productivity Performance
Relative strength due to a low relative price level does of course not provide a complete picture of comparative advantage. For that we need to compare productivity in both countries. In this paper we focus on labour productivity defined as value added per person employed and per hour worked based on national accounts estimates of output and employment. For this our main source are the Japanese and U.S. national accounts estimates as provided in the OECD STAN database of National Accounts.6 In Table 4 we convert Japanese output into U.S. dollars using the unit value ratios described above, and calculate the relative labour productivity level for the manufacturing branches.
Table 4 shows that labour productivity in Japanese manufacturing is substantially below the U.S. level, both in terms of value added per person employed as well as value added per hour worked. Relative productivity on a per hour basis is somewhat higher than on a per person basis, reflecting the higher number of hours worked in the United States (1989 hours per person) than in Japan (1977 hours per person) in 1997.

6 See Appendix A for more details on the data used. See Appendix C for a comparison using output and employment data from the Census and a reconciliation with the 1987 benchmark comparison as presented in van Ark and Pilat (1993).

As with relative price levels, heterogeneity in comparative productivity levels across industries is considerable. On the one hand, Japanese productivity in petroleum and coal, basic metal products and machinery and equipment is considerably above the level in the United States. Conversely, productivity in Japan in branches like wearing apparel and food products is less than half the U.S. level.

4. Explaining the labour productivity gap

When focusing on the productivity gap for the manufacturing sector as a whole between Japan

and the U.S., individual branches may contribute to this gap in two ways. First, as indicated above,

there may be a labour productivity gap in individual branches. Second, employment in the

manufacturing sector in Japan can also be more concentrated in branches with below-average

productivity levels such as textiles or wood products. One way to distinguish between these factors is

through an interspatial shift-share analysis.7 Let superscripts x and u denote respectively, Japan and

the U.S. and let LP stand for labour productivity. The difference in total manufacturing labour

productivity can be decomposed as follows:

where LPi is the labour productivity level in branch i and Si the share in employment of branch i. The

first term gives the contribution to the total manufacturing productivity gap of differences in branch

labour productivity (within-branch effect) while the second term shows the contribution of differences

in employment shares (structure effect).

Table 5 shows employment shares for each manufacturing branch as well as the results of the shift-share decomposition. 8 In this table, a positive number makes a positive contribution to the labour productivity gap of 24.2 percentage points. Conversely a negative number reduces the labour productivity gap. For example, the food products branch accounts for 5.8 percentage points of the total labour productivity gap. This positive contribution can be attributed to lower Japanese productivity in the food products branch, which increases the gap by 8.1 percentage points. However, the employment share of this industry is la rger in Japan than in the United States so the structure effect decreases the total contribution of the branch to the productivity gap.
As can be seen from the third column in table 5, differences in branch labour productivity account for about four-fifths of the total labour productivity gap. This means that one-fifth of JapanUS labour productivity gap in manufacturing is due to a larger concentration of U.S. employment in high labour productivity branches than in Japan. Table 5 makes clear that the larger size of the chemical sector (petroleum and oil, chemical products, rubber and plastics) in the U.S. is especially important in this respect, as is the paper, printing and publishing branch.
Looking at the contribution of each branch to the total productivity gap, the chemical branch is important, mainly through its structure effect. Food products, computers and fabricated metal products also make a large contribution to the Japan-US manufacturing productivity gap because of the much higher within-branch productivity in the United States, while the reverse is the case for machinery and equipment and basic metal products.

8 Labour productivity levels have been converted to dollars using Fisher UVRs. As these are not additive, branch contributions may not add up to total manufacturing. Therefore the contributions have been normalised.

5. The labour productivity trend from 1980 to 2000
Using time series on real output, employment and hours worked for both countries, the benchmark figures can be extrapolated to calculate labour productivity levels for the period 1980 to 2000. Figure 1 shows Japan's labour productivity level relative to the United States for total manufacturing on per person-basis as well as a per hour-basis over this period.

Productivity per person employed

Productivity per hour worked

Until 1991 productivity in Japanese manufacturing was still growing relative to productivity in the United States. Van Ark and Pilat (1993) show that the whole period from 1950-1990 can be characterized by strong catch-up to the U.S. le vel. Their figures show that in 1950, Japanese productivity in manufacturing stood at less than 20 percent of the level in the United States, while in 1990, this had risen to almost 80 percent. Although our levels for 1990 are somewhat lower (see Appendix C for details) a similar picture emerges. Figure 1 shows that this trend reversed from the 1991 Japanese recession onwards when productivity per hour began to drop from 79 percent to 72 percent of the U.S. level in 2000. Until 1993 workers in Japanese manufacturing worked more hours than their U.S. counterparts, but as hours between Japanese and U.S. workers converged, the per hourbased and per person-based productivity estimates have not been very different since. This development is seen in most branches, so in the remainder we will focus on the development of productivity per hour worked.

In Table 6, we show relative productivity in Japanese manufacturing branches for 1980, 1991, 1995 and 2000. For total manufacturing, we can see how the changes in relative levels reflect the comparative growth rates as presented in Table 1. Until 1991, Japanese growth outpaced U.S. growth, leading to rising productivity levels, but since then Japanese levels have dropped relative to those in the U.S..
It should be stressed that for two manufacturing branches, namely the office, accounting and computing machinery (OCM) branch and the electrical machinery and instruments branch, the growth rates we applied differ from the official national accounts estimate of real value added in Japan. For these branches we applied the U.S. price deflator to Japan for the period 1980-2000. The U.S. is one of the few countries which makes use of hedonic, or constant-quality, price indices for many ICT goods (see e.g. Grimm, Moulton and Wasshausen, 2002). As a result, prices of computers and semiconductors (the latter is part of the electrical machinery branch) show a much more rapid decline than in many other countries. Although prices of ICT goods in Japan also fall rapidly, the national accounts deflators for these branches do not appear to be compatible with those used in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts. To make a comparison possible, we therefore apply the U.S. deflators for the ICT industries to Japan.9 The last three lines of Table 6 show the productivity levels of OCM and electrical machinery and instruments if we were to use the Japanese ICT deflators, as well as the impact this would have on the figures for total manufacturing. In particular for OCM the results suggest an implausible development. The differences for electrical machinery and instruments are less pronounced, but here too Japanese productivity comes out more favourably for the last part of the sample period when using U.S. price indices. For total manufacturing our preferred procedure suggests a widening of the productivity gap by about 2.5 percentage points between 1995 and 2000, whereas the gap would have widened by 8 percentage points over only five years when using Japanese ICT deflators.10
Looking at other branches we see that in most branches relative labour productivity levels in Japan increased between 1980 and 1991 (12 of the 17 branches) while nearly all branches show declines after 1991 (15 of the 17 branches). This suggests that the declining relative productivity levels cannot be simply explained by booming productivity growth in the U.S. in, for example, the ICT-producing industries. For example, Table 6 also shows precipitous declines of productivity levels in branches such as textiles and le ather products. Wearing apparel is the most extreme example with a Japanese productivity level equal to that in the U.S. in 1991 but below 40 percent in 2000. The underlying figures show an absolute decrease in labour productivity of on average 6.7 percent per year in Japan relative to an average annual growth of 4 percent in the United States. Even though Japanese employment in this branch dropped by nearly a third, real output dropped by two-thirds leading to the large drop in productivity levels. Although other branches have suffered less, even branches such as electrical machinery that were characterized by low relative price levels in 1997 show declining relative productivity levels. Hence the widening productivity gap in manufacturing between Japan and the U.S. has been rather pervasive during the 1990s.
9 U.S. deflators are not directly applied, but after making a correction for differences in the general inflation level. See Appendix B of van Ark et al. (2002) for more details and Schreyer (2000, 2002) for further discussion on this method. 10 Our aggregate time series for total manufacturing also differ from the original national accounts series because we use a Törnqvist aggregation procedure. See also Appendix A and the additional columns with original national accounts data in appendix tables B3 and B4.

6. Unit Labour Cost

So far we have dealt with price competitiveness and relatively productivity but this reflects only part

of a country's competitive position in manufacturing. Labour productivity should also be related with

the (labour) cost of production to gauge cost competitiveness. This is commonly done by looking at

unit labour cost (ULC), defined as the labour cost of producing a unit of output. To compare ULC

across countries, both labour cost and value added need to be in the same currency. Labour cost is

converted using the exchange rate, while value added is converted using the appropriate UVRs as

before. This is to reflect that the development of the exchange rate has a direct effect on relative cost,

but not on relative labour productivity. This leads to the following expression for relative RULC:

RULC

=



LCH x ERxu LCH u



LPu UVR LP x

xu

 ,

(5)

where LCH is labour cost per hour and LP is productivity per hour (value added per hour

worked). In this equation x and u once again refer to Japan and the United States respectively

and all variables are expressed in U.S. dollars. Labour cost is converted at the exchange rate

(ER) and productivity is converted at the unit value ratio (UVR).11

To get a good comparison of relative unit labour cost, all components of labour compensation

(wage compensation, employee and employer taxes and premiums, and labour compensation for self-

employed persons) should be included. We therefore obtain data on total labour compensation of

employees from the national accounts in both countries and adjust these to include an imputed wage

sum for self-employed persons by assuming that the average wage of self-employed is equal to that of

employees. Table 7 shows the results for manufacturing branches and for total manufacturing for the

benchmark year 1997.

Overall ULC in Japan was 25.5 percent higher than in the U.S. in 1997. However, this hides a wide range of differences for the individual branches. ULC in Japan's wood industry is more than three times as high as in the U.S., while ULC in the basic metal branch is only 64 percent of the U.S. level.

11 See Stuivenwold and Timmer (2003) for a more detailed exposition of relative unit labour cost.

Relative ULC

Relative price level

With time series on productivity and labour compensation per hour, a trend can also be extrapolated. Figure 2 shows ULC for the period 1980-2000 as well as the relative price level (defined as the PPP divided by the exchange rate). As the figure shows, ULC in Japanese manufacturing has been higher than in the U.S. since 1987. Under the influence of a strengthening yen and slower productivity growth, Japanese ULC rose to a peak of 162 percent of the U.S. level in 1995. Since then relative ULC declined again, but in 2000 ULC was still nearly 30 percent higher in Japan than in the United States. The overall rising trend in Japanese ULC relative to the U.S. fits the long run picture as

15

described in Pilat and van Ark (1994). They show how in 1955 Japanese ULC was only half the U.S. level and as Figure 2 shows, in 1980 ULC was still 20 percent below the U.S. level.12
In Table 8 we look at the factors underlying the rise of Japanese ULC relative to the United States between 1980 and 2000. We split up the average annual change in relative ULC into changes in labour compensation and productivity in Japan and the U.S. as well as changes in the exchange rate.13 The bottom line of Table 8 shows how Japanese relative ULC grew by more than 2 percent on average per year between 1980 and 1991, before exploding by more than 10 percent per year until 1995. Between 1980 and 1991 Japanese labour cost per hour grew at about the same rate as in the U.S. and the exchange rate appreciated, but faster Japanese productivity growth held overall ULC growth in check.

The table shows that the major factor contributing to the movements in ULC after 1991 has been exchange rate fluctuations. Between 1991 and 1995 the Yen appreciated by on average 9 percent per year, accounting for nearly the entire annual 10.5 percent rise in relative ULC, but slower productivity growth in Japan contributed as well. After 1995, ULC declined again, which was partly due to a depreciating yen, but also to a strong decline in Japanese wage cost growth. Still, although productivity growth in Japanese manufacturing improved compared to 1991-1995, it continued to linger behind the U.S.
To gauge the competitiveness of Japanese exports, it is probably more important to focus on the development of relative ULC in branches like machinery and equipment, transport equipment and electrical machinery. If the relative ULC in food products rises sharply it is of little consequence since those goods are barely traded with the United States.14
The table shows that relative ULC has risen in nearly all manufacturing branches, which shows that decreasing Japanese cost competitiveness is a widespread phenomenon. The exception is the chemical products branch where cost competitiveness increased substantially between 1980 and 2000. There are also branches where despite a worsening position, Japan is still more cost competitive compared to the U.S. such as basic metal and electrical machinery. Especially basic metal products in Japan have remained very cheap compared to the United States. As with labour productivity levels most changes in the ULC level can be seen across all branches, reflecting the importance of exchange rate movements. A more favourable yen/dollar rate has outweighed the widespread U.S. productivity

12 As with labour productivity, the ULC level found by Pilat and van Ark (1994) based on the 1987 ICOP benchmark comparison is not the same as the level we find here, but it is roughly comparable. 13 Changes in relative prices are already accounted for in relative productivity changes. 14 Food products made up 0.29% of Japanese exports to the U.S. in 1997. The share of motor vehicles on the other hand was 28.7% (OECD Bilateral Trade Database, 2001).

growth advantage after 1995, which is reflected in considerable improvements Japanese cost competitiveness after 1995 in nearly all branches. Still, as mentioned above, ULC levels in 2000 were still well above those in the U.S. in most branches.

In Table 9 we also show the extra lines with the ULC development if we had applied the national ICT deflators to the ICT industries. These deflators would exaggerate the rise in relative Japanese ULC between 1980 and 2000, because of the implausible development of relative ULC in the office, accounting and computing machinery branch as well as the less favourable development of Japanese ULC in the electrical machinery branch. Still the overall picture remains unchanged, namely that Japanese cost competitiveness decreased considerably since 1980.

17

7. Conclusions In this paper we have studied several measures of competitiveness for the Japanese manufacturing sector relative to the United States over the period 1980-2000. Using industry-specific unit-value ratios (UVRs) we show that labour productivity in Japanese manufacturing lags considerably behind the U.S. in terms of both output per person employed and output per hour worked. For most of the 1990s Japanese manufacturing has fallen further behind the U.S. level. In 2000, value added per hour worked in Japanese manufacturing stood at 72 percent of the U.S. level after peaking at 79 percent in 1991. Underneath this aggregate estimate, there is a wide range of branch-specific labour productivity levels. But in general, Japanese manufacturing branches have not kept up with the strong productivity growth surge in the U.S. after 1995. For example, while in 1995 the electrical machinery branch was still more productive in Japan than in the U.S., in 2000 the U.S. had established a clear lead in this branch. The relative Japanese decline is not only seen in the ICT-producing industries such as computers and electrical machinery but also in such diverse branches as wearing apparel, transport equipment and rubber and plastics.
Japanese manufacturing has also suffered from rising unit labour cost levels. The long-term trend of a strengthening yen has eroded Japanese cost competitiveness in nearly all branches between 1980 and 2000, although ULC levels have declined somewhat from 1995 onwards due to a more favourable exchange rate development and moderate wage growth in Japan. Still in 2000 unit labour cost in Japanese manufacturing was still 27 percent above the U.S. level. In comparison, in 1980 Japanese unit labour cost stood at only 82 percent of the U.S. level.

Appendix A: Data sources and methods
This Appendix contains documentation on the sources and methods used to construct the data presented in the main text. We first deal with data used to calculate the unit value ratios for products, industries, branches and total manufacturing and then with the construction of data on trends in output, employment and labour compensation.
Product data and Census industry data
The unit value ratios (UVRs) are calculated on the basis of detailed data on sales quantities and values of a large number of products. For the U.S., these data are from the 1997 U.S. Economic Census and for Japan we use the Census of Manufacturing 1997, Report by Product.
Using data for quantities and values from the Census, 215 product matches were made.15 In Japan the value of shipments in the Census includes excise taxes, which leads to an overstatement of output of goods such as alcoholic drinks and petroleum products. We estimate indirect taxes as a percentage of gross output from the 1995 Input/Output table for Japan and refer to the Drinks industry for beer and Petroleum refinery products and Coal products for gasoline and related products.16
In addition to the Censuses of both countries we also use additional information on relative prices. For automobiles we use the hedonic car PPP from van Mulligen (2003). Twelve matches were included using information from a price survey of intermediate goods by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). To weigh the MITI matches, output data on these products were matched to the PPP data from the price survey. As these PPPs are based on producer prices, no adjustments had to be made to make them comparable to the rest of the matches. Finally, we include a PPP for computers based on the study of Gersbach and van Ark (1994). As this PPP is for 1987 we had to update it using the movement in relative prices between 1987 and 1997. For Japan we use the producer price index from the Bank of Japan for computers & related accessories. For the United States we apply the output price index for the computer industry used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic analysis in constructing the National Income and Product Accounts. The latter price index is obtained from the detailed tables `Shipments of Manufacturing Industries'.
UVRs at product level are weighted to arrive at UVRs for industries, branches and total manufacturing. For the U.S., the Economic Census presents data for 6-digit NAICS17 industries (comparable to the former 4-digit SIC8718 industries). For Japan, the Census of Manufacturers 1997, Report by Enterprise provides data for 4-digit JSIC19 industries. For the U.S. these data cover all establishments while for Japan only establishments with four or more employees are used. Since these data are only used to weight the industries in calculating branch PPPs, the omission of smaller establishments is unlikely to bias the results in any substantial way. To aggregate branch PPPs to a total manufacturing PPP we used gross output data from the National Accounts. This procedure could not be followed at the more detailed level due to insufficient detail in the National Accounts.
15 For Japan a `product' refers to one or more 6-digit items, for the U.S. it refers to one or more 10-digit (NAICS) items. 16 We used the 1995 I/O table since this contained more detailed industries than the 1997 I/O table from the OECD. 17 North American Industrial Classification System 18 Standard Industrial Classification, 1987 19 Japanese Standard Industrial Classification

Trends for output, employment and hours
For value added in current prices, implicit deflators for value added, and the total number of persons employed we mainly use information from the new OECD STAN Database. This database uses the national accounts of the two countries as its main source. However, to achieve the necessary detail and correspondence to ISIC rev3,20 we also use several secondary data sources. Hence apart from STAN we also use the Annual Survey of Manufacturers and the NBER Manufacturing Industry Database for the U.S. and the OECD Structural Statistics for Industry and Services, to break down the OECD STAN tables into more detailed industries. For Japan, the data in STAN cover all years up to 1998. At the time of writing, the data for Japan in STAN are still based on the old SNA68. We use data directly from the Japanese national accounts tables on an SNA93 basis to include 1999 and 2000 in the database.
The database on value added and the number of persons employed is described in detail in van Ark et al. (2002), where 27 manufacturing industries are distinguished. Since we only compute UVRs for 17 industries, some industries are combined. This was most noticeable for electrical machinery and instruments (ISIC 31-33), where seven separate industries are distinguished, including for example semiconductors (ISIC 321) and insulated wire (ISIC 313). Other industries that are built up from more detailed information are paper, printing and publishing (originally two industries) and transport equipment, where originally four industries are distinguished. To aggregate the deflators, we use a Törnqvist index number formula to achieve more consistency across countries. Our data for total manufacturing are also aggregated from the detailed 27 industries using a Törnqvist index. This aggregation method means that our trends for total manufacturing will differ from those in the National Accounts. While the U.S. also uses a chain-weighted index in the National Income and Product Accounts, their aggregation takes place at a more detailed level. The statistical office in Japan uses a fixed-weight Laspeyres index in its SNA68 National Accounts, which means our total manufacturing figure will differ even more, but the methodology is as consistent as possible across both countries, so the results can be better compared. For comparison we show the figures from the National Accounts in the detailed data tables of Appendix B.
Another reason for differences between our trend for manufacturing and those from the National Accounts is the difference in deflation of ICT industries. It is well known that those industries, which include computers and semiconductors, have shown rapid quality improvements over the past decades. The U.S. is one of the few countries where constant-quality price indices are used to deflate most ICT goods. These hedonic price indices show rapid price declines in the case of computers and semiconductors since the cost of computing power has decreased with increasing quality of these goods. We also apply these U.S. deflators to Japanese ICT industries (after correcting for differences in the general level of inflation).21 The reason is that using national deflators would almost certainly underestimate price declines in these industries. The pro-memoria lines in Tables 6 and 9 confirm that using national deflators would lead to a development of relative productivity that would be hard to justify.
For the number of hour worked per person, we relied on the ICOP Industry Database for total manufacturing.22 Data for the Japanese manufacturing branches are based on the number of monthly
20 International Standard Industrial Classification, revision 3. 21 The general inflation level is defined here as the change of the deflator of GDP, excluding the ICT industries.

hours worked from the Monthly Labour Survey of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. For the U.S. data for the manufacturing branches are from the Current Employment Statistics (CES) of the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) and the BLS Hours at Work Survey for 2000. From the CES we take the average weekly hours paid (of production workers) and we use the data from the Hours at Work Survey to adjust these to the average number of hours worked.
Data on labour compensation were also taken from the OECD STAN Database. For the computer industry these data were not available directly from STAN so we used additional data from Censuses to separately distinguish this industry. As labour compensation only refers to compensation of employees, we had to make an adjustment to include compensation for the self-employed as well. Here we assume that the average wage of self-employed is equal to that of employees. This imputation causes an overestimation of labour income in branches where employee income is already a large part of value added. In our dataset this occurs in three Japanese branches namely textiles, wearing apparel and wood products. In the case of textile products, even labour compensation of employees already exceeds value added for a number of years. While this means negative capital income, this is not entirely inconsistent with declining branches in a stagnating economy.

Appendix C: Census -based comparisons and reconciling the 1987 and 1997 ICOP manufacturing benchmarks
In the present benchmark comparison for 1997 for Japan-U.S., we rely on data on output and employment from the National Accounts to calculate relative productivity levels. In previous comparisons, notably those for 1987 (van Ark and Pilat, 1993) these data were taken from the manufacturing Censuses. This methodological change makes it more difficult to compare the consistency of the benchmarks. We have therefore first made a comparison for 1997 along the lines of the 1987 Japan-U.S. comparison of van Ark and Pilat (1993), and then reconciled that outcome with an extrapolation of the results from of the latter study to 1997.
To perform these productivity calculations, several adjustments had first to be made to the industry data from the censuses in both countries. Since in Japan firms with less than four employees are only fully surveyed every three years, we used the estimated figures provided in the Census of Manufacturing, Report by Industry 1997. Employment in head offices and auxiliary establishments are also not included in the Census of both countries. For Japan, we obtained these data from the Establishment and Enterprise Census for 1996. We considered workers in `Shops/eating and/or drinking establishments', `Offices/sales offices', `Shipping centers/delivery centers/garages', `Warehouses/oil tanks for domestic use' and `Others (schools, hospitals, temples/shrines, hotels/inns, bathhouses, etc.)' as head office and auxiliary employment. The remainder of the persons work in `Factories/workshops/mining stations' and `Establishments with vague distinction from an ordinary dwelling due to appearance'. The ratio of head office and auxiliary employment to total employment was applied to employment from the Census. For total manufacturing, this leads to an auxiliary ratio of 21.7 percent. This is somewhat higher than the 15.1 percent that was used by van Ark and Pilat (1993) for the 1987 comparison.
In the U.S., under the new NAICS classification, head office and auxiliary employment is allocated to separate industries like `Management of Companies and Enterprises'. For 1997, we therefore rely on data for head office and auxiliary employment from the 1996 Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM), which is the last Survey taken under the old SIC classification system. The auxiliary ratio from the 1996 ASM was 7.2 percent, which we applied to 1997 employment. This ratio is considerably smalle r than in Japan.
In Table C1, we show output and employment based on the Census of Manufacturers 1997 in Japan and the 1997 Economic Census for the United States. Since the data on hours worked do not differ much between both countries, we only report value added per person employed. For comparison, we also report value added per person employed based on the National Accounts from Table 4. For total manufacturing, differences are small, but for a number of branches, the results are very different. It is hard to pin down exactly what is causing these differences, but an important difference is the definition of value added. Census value added still includes purchased services, while value added in the National Accounts excludes all purchased intermediates. From that perspective, the figures from the National Accounts should give a `cleaner' definition of value added. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the 1997 U.S. Economic Census is based on new surveys and a new classification system (NAICS), while the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts are still based on the old classification system (SIC87). Classifications have been adjusted to the extent possible, but differences may still arise from this switch. One exception is that in the current data for Japan, plastic products are included as part of miscellaneous manufacturing.

In Table C2, we compare the Census-based results for the 1997 benchmark with the results for the 1987 benchmark from van Ark and Pilat (1993). To make this comparison possible, we extrapolated the figures from van Ark and Pilat (1993) to 1997 using the growth rates of (current) value added, the manufacturing deflators and employment from the National Accounts.23 Table C2 therefore shows what the results would have been if we had simply extrapolated from van Ark and Pilat (1993) and what the results are when based on new manufacturing UVRs and data from the 1997 Census in both countries.
As a bottom-line it is clear that the 1997 benchmark leads to productivity level in Japanese manufacturing relative to the U.S. that is 7.1 percentage points lower than the (extrapolated) 1987 benchmark. This difference is decomposed in the effect of differences between the actual census value added data (as recorded in 1997 statistics) and the extrapolated census value added (extrapolated from 1987), the differences in actual and extrapolated employment and the effect of a different UVR sample for 1987 vis-à-vis 1997. Differences between the extrapolated 1987 census-based and the 1997 census-based benchmark data output and employment are relatively modest for Japan, but for the U.S. differences these are larger in the case of value added. As mentioned above, there has been a switch to a new classification system in the U.S., which may well affect comparisons across Census years. However, the biggest difference is in the PPP, which is around 7 percent higher for the 1997 benchmark than for the extrapolated 1987 benchmark. Part of this may be due to a changing output structure in both countries. However, if we impose the 1997 output structure on the 1987 branch UVRs, the total manufacturing PPP for 1987 extrapolated to 1997 becomes 127.6 instead of 131.0. In other words, changing economic structure is a relatively minor factor and increases the differences between the benchmarks. After eliminating structural effects across branches, all differences in the aggregate UVR have to be ascribed either to structural change within each branch or to a different sample of UVRs. While we cannot fully reconcile these differences, it would seem that our 1997 benchmark is at least somewhat more reliable because the number of matches is somewhat larger (215 versus 190) while the output coverage by product matches is about the same (and even somewhat

higher in Japan). Moreover, we have made somewhat greater adjustment for quality differences in this

study, in particular because of the use of a hedonic UVR for cars and the use of a quality-adjusted

UVR for computers.

In terms of contributions to the overall difference, differences in output and employment in Japan and the U.S. almost cancel out (productivity is around 4 percent higher under the 1997 benchmark in both countries than under the 1987 benchmark). The remainder can be attributed to the difference in the UVR.
A similar story can be told for the relative unit labour cost calculations. In van Ark and Pilat (1994), Japanese ULC in 1990 is 99.5 percent of the U.S. level based on their 1987 benchmark, while our results for the 1997 benchmark show a level of 100.6 percent in 1990. This difference can be partly ascribed to the higher PPP we find, but also to methodological changes. Recall that ULC is defined as labour compensation per hour divided by productivity per hour. Van Ark and Pilat (1994) calculate la bour compensation per hour based on the National Accounts, just like we do. However, productivity per hour is calculated from the Census. Still, these results are sufficiently close that it should not be an important worry.
