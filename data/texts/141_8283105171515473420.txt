Summary: Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) is an outpatient surgical procedure which is in use as a treatment for snoring. LAUP also has been used as a treatment for sleep-related breathing disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea. The Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reviewed the available literature, and developed these practice parameters as a guide to the appropriate use of this surgery. Adequate controlled studies on the LAUP procedure for sleep-related breathing disorders were not found in peer-reviewed journals. This is consistent with findings in the original practice parameters on LAUP published in 1994. The following recommendations are based

on the review of the literature: LAUP is not recommended for treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders. However, it does appear to be comparable to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) for treatment of snoring. Individuals who are candidates for LAUP as a treatment for snoring should undergo a polysomnographic or cardiorespiratory evaluation for sleeprelated breathing disorders prior to LAUP and periodic postoperative evaluations for the development of same. Patients should be informed of the best available information of the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.

INTRODUCTION
LASER-ASSISTED UVULOPALATOPLASTY (LAUP) HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS A TREATMENT OF SNORING, AND IN SOME CASES, for sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This surgical procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting with local anesthesia and without postoperative hospitalization. At the present time, LAUP is in current use. In this article, we review the appropriate patient evaluation and the effectiveness, potential risks, and complications of LAUP for OSA, and provide recommendations for its use. This update generally examines evidence for LAUP in the therapy of OSA since the publication of the expert review;1 grades the evidence available; and modifies and replaces the 1994 practice parameters.1
METHODS
Medline searches for articles on LAUP were conducted through September 2000. Key words for the search included LAUP, laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty, laser-assisted uvuloplasty, laser surgery, somnoplasty, base of the tongue reduction, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), uvulopalatoplasty, uvuloplasty, uvulectomy, uvulotomy, uvula, and all possible combinations of the preceding terms with snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, sleep apnea syndromes, and upper airway surgery. This search led to a total of 641 articles. Thirty-two of these articles were published prior to the original American Academy of Sleep Medicine's

(AASM) Practice Parameters for the Use of Laser-Assisted Uvulopalatoplasty1 in 1994, which incorporated 17 of the 32 articles in that previous review of the literature. Articles in all languages were considered for inclusion, and were screened based on their English-language abstracts. A total of 123 articles were identified as potentially relevant based on review of the abstracts. Of these, 90 were obtained in full length and examined. Upon review of these articles, an additional 45 references were discovered by pearling (i.e., the process of selecting relevant articles referenced in the original article). These were references located in publications not typically found through Medline. The types of these publications, with the total number of publications per type (in parentheses) are listed: books (6), coursebooks (1), meeting and symposium abstracts or proceedings (8), highly specific or trade journals (30). Articles entered into the evidence tables (Tables 1 and 2) included randomized trials and nonrandomized controlled or concurrent cohort studies on the comparison with UPPP for snoring and OSA (Table 1) and peer-reviewed case series and historical cohort studies on the efficacy of LAUP for OSA (Table 2), with a minimum of five patients and a clearly defined outcome that could be used to adequately assess the therapy. In the case of the peer-reviewed case series and historical cohort studies entered in Table 2, studies were included only if the "effect size" (Table 3) or the overall effect of LAUP on the number of respiratory events during sleep (described below) could be derived from the article. Articles describing nonrandomized historical cohort studies (13), case series (45), and other studies (69) derived from the search were found useful as background articles. The Standards of Practice Committee's levels of evidence (Table 4) for treatment-related evidentiary articles, which are used to support the strength of the recommendations (Table 5) in this paper, are found in the evidence tables (Tables 1 and 2).

On the basis of this review and noted references, the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, in conjunction with specialists and other interested parties, developed the review and recommendations included in this paper. In most cases, the conclusions are based on evidence from studies published in peer-reviewed journals that were evaluated as noted in the evidence tables (Tables 1 and 2). However, when scientific data are absent, insufficient, or inconclusive, the recommendations are based upon consensus opinion. The strength of each recommendation is based on the level of the evidence available or on consensus when evidence is lacking.
The Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine approved this review and these recommendations. All authors of this review, members of Standards of Practice Committee, and the Board of Directors completed detailed conflict-of-interest statements and were found to have none with regard to this subject.
These practice parameters define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients in most situations. These guidelines should not, however, be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably directed toward obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific care must be made by the physician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient and the available diagnostic and treatment options as resources.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine expects these guidelines to have a positive impact on professional behavior, patient outcomes and, possibly health care costs. These practice parameters reflect the state of knowledge at the time of development and will be reviewed, updated, and revised, as new information becomes available.
Background
LAUP is a surgical procedure that typically relies on the use of a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser to vaporize the uvula and a part of the free edge of the soft palate during one to several sessions. Within the scope of this definition, various degrees of tissue are ablated using slightly different techniques. This procedure is different from conventional uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), in that LAUP is performed during a comparatively brief surgical session, reduces far less palatal tissue and does not alter the tonsils or the pharyngeal pillars, uses a laser rather than a scalpel, requires no wound closure, uses local rather than general anesthesia, is conducted in an ambulatory rather than hospital setting, and requires no postoperative hospital stay.1 LAUP is distinguished from the laser palatoplasty procedure described by Ellis2 in which a soft palate lesion produced by a neodymium:yttriumaluminum-garnet laser induces scarring, which stiffens the soft palate and reduces "palatal flutter," which in turn, reduces snoring.
Patient Evaluation
The selection process for candidates for this procedure ranges from patient history, questionnaire data, use of the Müller maneuver, oral and nasopharyngoscopic examination, polysomnography, and a variety of imaging studies. Although some investigators proposed decision algorithms3 or imaging studies to localize

the site of obstruction,4,5 there is no consensus on the preoperative selection process for this procedure. However, a patient deciding on LAUP as a treatment for snoring should be properly screened for a more severe sleep-related breathing disorder such as OSA. Clinical evaluation can be unreliable; a clinical history and results of a physical examination by a physician to generate a subjective judgment as to whether a given patient did or did not have OSA yielded a correct identification in 52% of patients with OSA and a specificity of 70%.6 Another study showed that out of 73 patients seeking LAUP treatment, 69 (95%) had OSA by polysomnography, even though 41% presented only with a complaint of snoring.7 Additionally, the patients' subjective ratings of snoring loudness, frequency, and consequences did not correlate with any of the respiratory variables obtained by polysomnography. Thus, a sleep study, in the form of standard polysomnography or Level III recording also called a cardiorespiratory study,810 is indicated to exclude the possibility of OSA in potential candidates for this procedure for snoring. A Level III recording includes at least four channels with recording of at least two respiratory effort channels or a respiratory effort channel and an airflow channel, plus oximetry and either heart rate or electrocardiogram.
Effectiveness, Risks, and Complications of LAUP for Snoring and OSA
In 1990, Kamami described the use of LAUP on 31 adult patients.11 Following up to seven sessions a maximum of three weeks apart, snoring was completely eliminated or remained as an occasional soft snore in 24/31 (77.4%) of the patients, and a persistent non-disturbing snore in 7/31 (22.6%) of the patients. Neither infection nor significant bleeding was detected; patients reported pain similar to a simple "sore throat." The patients noted improvement in fatigue, morning headaches, and irritability; however, it is unknown whether any of the subjects had OSA, since preoperative screening polysomnography was not performed.
Although there are a number of case series subsequent to Kamami's original study, randomized placebo-controlled studies on the effectiveness of LAUP for OSA are lacking. This lack provides evidence of limited value in determining if LAUP has efficacy in OSA. However, by combining a number of the case series studies,5,12-17 it is possible to determine an overall effect of LAUP on the number of respiratory events during sleep. The "effect size" of each study is derived from the difference between the pre- and post-LAUP number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep (also called the pre- and post- apnea hypopnea index, AHI) divided by the standard deviation of the pre-LAUP AHI.18 The effect size can be adjusted by a factor related to the number of subjects in each study.19 The overall effect of a number of studies can be expressed as the average of the sum of individual unadjusted or adjusted effect sizes18,19 of each study. The case series studies were selected from the total number of case series articles obtained through our literature search. The criteria used for inclusion of these articles in the calculation of effect size were studies in which the mean pre- and post-LAUP AHI across subjects as well as the pre-LAUP standard deviation were provided in the article, or could be derived from data present in the article. When the effect size analysis was performed (Table 3), the average unadjusted effect size was 0.392. The average adjusted effect

604 Practice Parameters--Littner et al

size was 0.251. Because there is no comparison with placebo or with another procedure, it is difficult to determine if this effect is likely to be meaningful. However, in general, an effect size between 0.2 and 0.5 (as is the average in the LAUP studies) is considered to be in the small range.18 By comparison, an effect size between 0.5 and 0.8 is considered to be medium and greater than 0.8 is considered to be large.
The reader should be aware of the following in interpreting information on LAUP. It is not clear if the general interpretation of effect size can be applied to the specific case of LAUP. The reduction in AHI may not be clinically significant since there are few outcome measures such as sleepiness and systematic quality of life reported in the literature. Although the overall effect is a small improvement, individual patients may show no reduction or an increase in AHI.20 Apart from the near-term post-operative effects of LAUP on AHI, the long-term efficacy of LAUP on OSA is undefined. Interpretation of the effect of LAUP is based on studies that have described different surgical procedures ranging from excising comparable amounts of tissue as those removed with UPPP,21 to varied and lesser excisions.22,23
As illustrated in Table 2, there are six Level III studies, representing nonrandomized controlled or concurrent cohort studies, 3,21,24-27 comparing LAUP vs. UPPP (either with or without tonsillectomy).3,21,24-27 One study evaluated OSA,24 one study examined snoring and OSA3 and one study examined snoring and upper airway size.26 Two of the three studies showed a decrease in AHI which because of sample size could not be compared for degree of efficacy to UPPP;3,24 the remaining study showed worsened postoperative upper airway anatomic characteristics by oral and nasopharyngoscopic examination for LAUP compared to UPPP patients.25 Four studies reported subjective postoperative improvement in snoring levels with LAUP and no significant differences in levels of improvement between LAUP vs. UPPP.3,21,26-27 However, interpretation of the results of all of the above studies is difficult given the relative lack of detailed statistical analyses of the data. As mentioned above, comparisons between studies are further limited by lack of standardization of the procedure.
Lastly, the long-term effectiveness of LAUP on treatment of snoring has not been convincingly established. Two separate studies found snoring improvement of 89.6% and 90%, in patients assessed between one and eight years and at five years following LAUP.28,29 Less satisfactory results were found in a study that showed snoring improvement was reduced to 62.2% beyond two years.14 Another study found that 22% of patients had recurrence of snoring between 18 and 24 months following LAUP, with an overall success rate of 55% at 24 months,30 and a separate study found snoring improvement in 43% of patients, with 21% showing no improvement and 36% showed significant deterioration on sleep studies performed 3 to 24 (mean=7) months postoperatively.31 Following an average post-LAUP duration of four years, another study found that 51.6% of patients reported that their snoring was eliminated.13 As mentioned , the long-term efficacy on LAUP on OSA is not defined but should be considered problematic in view of the inconsistent findings on the long-term efficacy of LAUP on snoring.
There are data to suggest that the pain levels associated with LAUP may be comparable to those of UPPP. One study showed no difference between the average pain scores for the first (typi-

cally the most painful) LAUP stage and UPPP.26 However, the patients treated with UPPP remained in the hospital overnight and received parenteral analgesia. Another study showed similar maximum pain peaks and intensity for LAUP vs. UPPP, with comparable mean durations of the pain period of 13.76 and 11.80 days, respectively.3 Similar results were reported in a separate study, which found comparable mean durations of the pain period for LAUP (13.8 days) vs. UPPP (14.3 days).32
Besides pain, the most commonly reported side effects from LAUP appear to be transient velopharyngeal insufficiency, minor bleeding, local infection, globus sensation, and minor dysphonia and dysphagia.33,34 Based on the literature review, the most common side effects with their reported frequency of occurrence are listed in Table 6. In 27% of LAUP patients, either persistent dysphagia35 or mild or moderate scar fibrosis24 have been observed. Postoperative swelling may compromise an already marginal upper airway; use of narcotics or sedatives may further complicate this problem. Alcohol should be avoided because of its adverse effects on upper airway muscle tone and closing pressures in snorers.36 The smoke plume from lasers can create a biological and chemical hazard for the patient and surgical team; however, an efficient smoke evacuator used during LAUP can obviate this hazard.37
There is also evidence to indicate that LAUP may result in a diminished velopharyngeal air space and decreased distensibility.25 This study suggests that these structural modifications of the upper airway may decrease airway resistance, resulting in further narrowing during inspiration and collapse of the upper airway at the level of the tongue base, and consequent OSA. These results, from an anatomical perspective, indicate that LAUP may have a worse outcome than UPPP. A separate study examining LAUP patients between 48 and 72 hours after LAUP found worsening of the AHI, with a significant decrement in the cross-sectional area of the airway by videoendoscopy.20 A study examining histopathologic changes of the soft palate after LAUP found extensive thermal-induced changes including diffuse fibrosis, oral epithelia ulceration, and a patchy inflammatory reaction, which the authors speculate may be responsible for worsening of OSA.38
The selection process for candidates for LAUP or the anatomic, histopathologic, and physiologic effects of this procedure have not been well characterized, and there is a lack of understanding of its consequences on pathologic respiration and its long-term effectiveness. In general, since insufficient data exists on the effectiveness and risks of LAUP, patients who elect to undergo this procedure as a treatment for snoring should have appropriate preoperative evaluation including screening for OSA, and should have close postoperative follow-up to monitor the patient for possible complications of this procedure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations of the Standards of Practice Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine are similar to those published in its last report in 1994, since adequate controlled studies on the LAUP procedure were not found in peer-reviewed journals. The classification of evidence was adapted from the suggestions of Sackett39 (Table 4). Recommendations are given as standards, guidelines, and options, as defined in Table 5.

SLEEP, Vol. 24, No. 5, 2001

605 Practice Parameters--Littner et al

1. LAUP is not recommended for the treatment of the sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea. (Guideline)
There is insufficient evidence to recommend LAUP for the treatment of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The Level V, Grade C evidence from seven articles5,12-17 indicates that LAUP provides a small overall decrease in AHI in a group of patients, that preoperative prediction strategies for selecting patients who respond have not been developed, that some patients may have an increase in AHI, and that there is insufficient information on other outcome measures or long-term efficacy. Therefore, we do not recommend LAUP for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. This recommendation is similar to a recommendation of the previous practice parameter paper.1
2. LAUP is not recommended as a substitute for UPPP in the treatment of sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea. (Guideline)
There are three studies with Level III, Grade C evidence3,24,25 on comparison including measurement of AHI or airway size. When considered in conjunction with the small effect size of LAUP on AHI, these studies provide insufficient evidence to indicate that LAUP is an acceptable substitute for UPPP with respect to either effectiveness or side effect profiles as a treatment for OSA. This is a new recommendation.
3. LAUP appears comparable to UPPP in relieving subjective snoring. (Guideline)
There are 4 Level III, Grade C studies that compare LAUP to UPPP for snoring. These studies suggest that LAUP can reduce snoring measured by subjective criteria to a similar degree as UPPP. This is a new recommendation.
4. Surgical candidates for LAUP as a treatment for snoring should undergo a preoperative clinical evaluation and a polysomnographic or a cardiorespiratory study8-10 to determine if the candidate has a sleepdisordered breathing disorder including obstructive sleep apnea. (Standard)
Since snoring is a primary diagnostic symptom, patients who undergo LAUP should be informed of the need for periodic evaluation for subsequent development of obstructive sleep apnea even if the procedure reduces or eliminates snoring. (Standard)
These recommendations are based on information regarding the natural course of OSA. Snoring may predate onset of OSA, as well as other symptoms of OSA such as excessive daytime sleepiness.40 Although snoring is neither necessary nor sufficient for the diagnosis of a sleep-related breathing disorder, it is frequently an

associated symptom. It is estimated that the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea ranges from 25% to as high as 95% in snorers.8,9 In one study reviewing patients seeking LAUP treatment specifically for snoring, 95% had OSA by polysomnography.5 The presence of other risk factors for sleep apnea such as obesity and age, as well as other associated symptoms such as daytime sleepiness and witnessed breathing pauses, increase the risk for concomitant sleep apnea. Given the life-threatening conditions (e.g., myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, stroke) associated with sleep-related breathing disorders and the increased risk for motor-vehicle or industrial accidents secondary to the daytime sleepiness related to sleep-disordered breathing, it is prudent to test for these disorders. Patients who elect to undergo LAUP for the treatment of snoring may also be at risk of incurring a delay in the diagnosis of OSA because snoring may be reduced or eliminated by LAUP. Thus, after LAUP for treatment of snoring, the patient should be notified regarding the possibility of developing OSA, and should be monitored for the occurrence of this disorder. These recommendations are similar to recommendations of the previous practice parameter paper.1
5. The need for medications that affect respiration during the perioperative period should be assessed during the preoperative clinical evaluation (Standard).
This recommendation is based on consensus of the SPC. the perioperative use of narcotics may pose risks for patients who have undergone LAUP operations; therefore, the need for these medications should be carefully assessed during the preoperative clinical evaluation. Careful clinical judgment should be used when prescribing other pain medications, sedatives, sleeping pills and alcohol during the perioperative period. The rationale is that these medications may blunt respiratory drive. This is especially important since postoperative swelling may reduce the caliber of an already narrowed airway. Alternatives, such as oral or topical non-narcotic pain medications during the perioperative periods, should be used whenever possible, and hypnotics and alcohol should be avoided because of their deleterious effects on upper airway tone. This recommendation is similar to a recommendation of the previous practice parameter paper.1
6. Patients should be informed of the risks and complications of LAUP. (Standard)
There are studies specifically evaluating the risks and complications of LAUP (Table 6). Any patient electing to undergo LAUP for treatment of snoring should be informed of the potential risks and complications of this procedure. This recommendation is based on the documented risks of LAUP and SPC consensus and is similar to a recommendation of the previous practice parameter paper.1

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Investigations to identify the best treatment for snoring or OSA should include well-powered, multicenter clinical trials using randomized study designs with an appropriate endpoint or outcome. The use of objective measures for evaluating outcomes and sham or sub-therapeutic controls is encouraged. Future studies should provide LAUP definitions, long-term effectiveness data, cost-benefit analyses, direct comparison between different treatments, and the impact of treatment on quality of life.

SD - Standard Deviation of the mean SE - Standard error of the mean SE = SD/(square root of the number of subjects) * Time from last LAUP treatment to post-LAUP PSG ** Effect size = (Pre-LAUP AHI mean - Post-LAUP AHI mean) / Pre-LAUP AHI standard deviation ***unadjusted average is the sum of the individual effects sizes/the number of studies (7 in this case) ****adjusted average is 1/SE2 times [(Pre-LAUP AHI mean - Post-LAUP AHI mean)/ Pre-LAUP AHI standard deviation] for each study and summing the results. This sum is divided by the sum of the 1/SE2 for each of the 7 studies where SE is the standard error of the pre-LAUP mean NA - Not applicable
*Alpha error refers to the probability (generally set at 95% or greater) that a significant result (e.g., p<0.05) is the correct conclusion of the study or studies. Beta error refers to the probability (generally set at 80% or 90% or greater) that a nonsignificant result (e.g., p>0.05) is the correct conclusion of the study or studies. The estimation of beta error is generally the result of a power analysis. The power analysis includes a sample size analysis which projects the size of the study population necessary to ensure that significant differences will be observed if actually present.
