Talk given at the colloquium titled "Ten Years of Algol", 
 EidgenSssische Technische Hochschule, ZUrich, 31. May 1968. 

Abstract 

The development of Algol during 1958 to 1968 is reviewed. 
 The influences leacLing up to the Algol 60 report are singled 
 out and the directions of stimulus from that report are evaluated. 
 The later relations of Algol with IFIP are critically reviewed, 
 and the need for a drastic revision of the constitution of IFIP 
 is pointed out. 

To set the tone for what I am g o i n g to say, I must warn you right away that my feelings at being present at this occasion are very mixed. I am certainly happy to be among many old friends, with whom I have had both many stimulating battles and many hours of pleasant social interchange. On the other hand, where the topic of our colloquium, Algol, is concerned, I have to confess a deep feeling of unhappiness. In fact, this feeling is so strong that it has needed more than an ordinary dose of persuasion from our host, Heinz Rutishauser, to talk me out of my decision to stay away from this meeting altogether. Also, this dose of persuasion includes an explicit permission to express my current feelings about the development of Algol.
I t i s a l s o r e l e v a n t f o r you t o know t h a t t h e s e my f e e l i n g s have been growing over the l a s t s e v e r a l y e a r s . Already some time ago I have t u r n e d my e f f o r t s away from programming languages to o t h e r f i e l d s o f computer s c i e n c e , and I have r e s i g n e d from I F I P Working @roup 2.t on Algol.
What I w i l l do i s t o review the p a s t 10 y e a r s o f development, with an eye to the successes and failures of our enterprise. This perhaps w i l l j u s t i T y my p r e s e n t a t t i t u d e and the recommendations which I s h a l l make at the end.
The period l e a d i n g up to Algol 60, i . e . t h e y e a r s 1958 to 1960 was of course the d e c i s i v e one in the development, and taken as a whole a success f o r the Algol e f f o r t . To understand the subsequent development better it is, however, necessary to take a closer look at this period and to disentangle the various influences and achievements.
As I see it, this first period was characterized by an unusual 
 combination of mutually supporting circ,,m~tances. One very important 
 factor was the strong activity in central Europe~ carried by several 
 groups, including the one around Rutishauser here in ZUrich and the 
 one around Bauer and Samelson in Mainz. Through this activity there 
 was a deep understanding of both language and compiler problems, and o f the need f o r a sound, common programming language. Another v i t a l f a c t o r was the s i m i l a r development in the United S t a t e s , including

AB28 p 59
the then recent successful development of Fortran. A third envigorating 
 factor was the influence of the Amsterdam school, supplying powerful a~l 
 general ideas about the central features of programming languages. A 
 fourth factor was the development, by Backus, of a suitable syntax notation. 
 More important still than any of these single factors, there was a general 
 sense of urgency and a will to cooperate. 

The spectacular outcome of this lucky combination of circumstances 
 was the Algol 60 report. However, let us not be mislead into believing 
 that this alone represents all what may reasonably be called the Algol 
 effort. This depends as much on the subsequent developments. It is 
 significant that the Algol 60 report has stirred work in at least five 
 distinctly different directions. 

As the first direction of influence from the Algol 60 report I 
 would like to put the programming of computers. In this field I will 
 Judge the Algol effort to be a partial success. As a core language 
 Algol 60 is excellent, but the absense of input and output facilities 
 of all sorts is, and remains, a serious shortcoming. 

The second distinct influence from Algol 60 is in the publication 
 of algorithms. I would judge this to be the most successful part of 
 the Algol effort, and one where the benefits are only about to be 
 tapped in full measure. 

As the third influence, Algol 60 has acted as a strong stimulus 
 to compiler designers. Again this influence may be judged to be largely 
 beneficial. However, it does contain in it the seed of corruption; it 
 cannot be the task of the designers of common programming langnages to 
 produce hard nuts for the compiler designers to crack. 

Pourth, Algol 60 has stimulated research on formal languages, far 
 beyond the needs of compiler design. Again I would consider this success 
 to be of doubtful value for the primary aim of our effort. 

Fifth, the Algol 60 report, through its very form has had considerable 
 influence on the thinking about the proper lays to describe programming 
 languages. In so far as the Algol b0 report has made it clear that a 
 carefully worded, defining description is of great value for the work with 
 progr-mm4ng languages, so far the description of Algol 60 may be counted 
 as a success of our effort. But this must not blind us to the need for 
 descriptions oriented to human readers. In view of the fact that the 
 Algol 60 report has gained the reputation of being very hard on the 
 uninitiated reader, we must conclude that on this score our efforts have 
 been a failure. The Algol 60 report ought to have contained an informal 
 introduction and description of the language, including an account of 
 the reasons for including the various features. We failed in this arxl 
 suffered a great deal of lack of understanding thereby. 

During the two years following 1960 the official activity centered 
 around the revision of the Algol 60 report. This in itself I would 
 count as rather insignificant. But it is symptomatic of the reduction 
 of the sense of urgency and purpose among the authors.

Far more important than the r e v i s i o n was the t r a n s i t i o n to being Working Group 2.1 of XFIP. In this there were two immediate f a i l u r e s : (q) The extreme clumsiness with which i t was done, due, I am s u r e , t o t h e f a c t t h a t IFXP n e e d e d A l g o l f a r more b a d l y than Algol needed IFXP. (2) The use of the vague concept "Algol" in the name o f the Working @roup 2 . 1 . A more a p p r o p r i a t e name would have been "GeneraA Purpose Programming Languages". Perhaps the worst consequence of this failure was that the Algol-Fortran antagonism was made o f f i c i a l , with the f u r t h e r extremely u n f o r t u n a t e consequence that PL/~ was developed without any o f f i c i a l connection with Algol.
The first period of the lift of IFIP Working @roup 2.1 on Algol 
 was dominated by the definitions of the IFIP Subset of Algol 60 and the 
 IFIP Input-Output Procedures for Algol 60. These I consider to be rather 
 insignificant events. The Subset I believe is reasonably successful, 
 while the Input-Output Procedures are largely a failure, being too late 
 to have much influence and too limited in scope. 

After these m4,~r incidents, the urge to produce a new language, 
 o r even two new l a n g u a g e s , a r o s e . Perhaps we s h o u l d count i t a s a 
 major failure of the Algol 60 effort that it had created the false 
 impression that this could be done fairly easily by an act of will. 
 The attitude within IFIP Working ~roup 2.1 became dominated by the 
 desire to produce a monument, an urge that I consider extremely harmful. It has distorted the idea of what was, and what was not, achieved in the Algol 60 r e p o r t . As one consequence on the road, the e x c e l l e n t work o f Wirth and Hoare, published in their Contribution to the Development of Algol (Comm. ACM, June 4966), was swept aside. Instead Van WiJngaarden 
 was allowed to continue alone, along the tangent of formalized description. 
 The latest result of this is the report MR93 of the Mathematical Center in 
 Amsterdam. 

I f e e l t h a t t h e d i r e c t i o n t a k e n i n t h e r e p o r t MR93, viewed w i t h i n the context of a committee established to work on programming languages of broad common u t i l i t y and a p p e a l , i s completely wrong. I n s t e a d o f l e a r n i n g from the e x p e r i e n c e gained in the work l e a d i n g to Algol 60~ it amplifies the failures of that effort. It sets out to provide the 
 ult~,wte in formality of description, a point where Algol 60 was strong 
 enough. In doing so, MR93 sets a new record of lack of appeal to h , m n 
 readers. In fact, it makes an attempt to create, not only its own special 
 terminology, but a linguistic universe wholly of its own, and requires, to 
 quote Mike Woodger, that the reader mill have "his normal reading instincts .. 
 thoroughly suppressed". In MR93 nothir~ seems to have been learnt from the 
 outstanding failure of the Algol 60 report, its lack of informal introduction 
 and justification. 

In s a y i n g t h i s I do n o t wish t o imply t h a t t h e MR93 r e p o r t does n o t contain good work. Admittedly, I have found m~rself unable to discover it t h a t i s t h e primary reason why I f e l t t h a t I could not h o n e s t l y remain a member of IFIP Working Group 2.1 - but the critical ~eviews of it which 
 have been produced by various people, better equipped to understand it 
 than I, make me feel confident that it does contain brilliant ideas and 
 concepts. 0 n t h e same evidence I have got the impression that it contains 
 flaws reaching its very core. 


AB28 p 61
If MR93 were just promoted as a contribution from its authors 
 this would not give aNY special cause for concern. However, this 
 work has been tied in with the plans of IFIP to such a degree that 
 the possibility of a further development of the ideas of MR93 in a 
 sensible fashion has been closed. In fact, IFIP calls for a virtual 
 wholesale acceptance or rejection of MR93, now. 

The true villain of this unreasonable situation is the big 
 international organization, IFIP. In fighting IFIP I of course 
 make myself ridiculous, for what is the use of fighting such a thing - 
 whatever you saY about it, it will just continue. The trouble is that 
 no-one questions the construction of this type of organization. It is 
 accepted as a necessary evil by most, used for personal advancement by a few. It is overlooked that the performance of such an organization depends critically on its laws.
One thing which is wrong with IFIP is that it is totally authoritarian 
 and thus entirely out of keeping with the needs of a rapidly developing 
 field like computing, with the intensive exchange of ideas among ma~7 
 individuals. Think of the communication channels within IFIP: committee 
 chairman reporting at long intervals to their superior bodies. We must 
 imagine that the people who decided this structure had never heard of 
 the principle of feedback and its importance in well-adjusted systems. 
 Or take the rules for the life of committees and working groups. Is 
 there a forum for an open debate around the selection of chairmen? No s i r , t h i s i s done i n c l o s e d m e e t i n g s . I s t h e r e a p r o v i s i o n f o r r e g u l a r r e p l a c e m e n t o f chairmen? No s i r , t h e y J u s t go on and on. I s t h e r e a p r o v i s i o n f o r k i l l i n g a T e c h n i c a l Committee o r a Working Group? No s i r j this will have to wait for a catastrophe or a scandal. 

But still, the supporter of IFIP will say, we do need this 
 organization for doing big, significant things outside the realm of 
 the giant manufacturers. Well, this claim is just wrong, as evidenced 
 by the construction of SIMULA. 

By seizing the name of Algol, IFIP has used the effort done before 
 it even existed, for its own glorification. At the same time IFIP has 
 entirely lost control, not only over the use of the word Algol, but over 
 the ~A-es of the memhers of the Working Group 2.1. In fact, a document 
 cla4m~ng to he the draft report of Algol 68, quoting the names of the 
 members of Working Group 2.1, is for sale, publicly, in London and 
 elsewhere. I consider this a thorough misuse of authority. But who 
 is there to stop it? 

L e t i t he q u i t e c l e a r : i n my o p i n i o n t h e i n t e r v e n t i o n o f I F I P , with its heavy organizational structure and pretentiousness, has caused far more harm than good to the Algol effort. The present dilemma is j u s t the f i n a l confirmation of t h i s . The honest thing to do now i s t o a~m4t f a i l u r e . More s p e c i f i c a l l y , what IFIP should do i s : f i r s t , make a formal decision that the name Algol will only be used within IFIP and 
 its organizations to denote Algol 60, thus admitting defeat in the attempt 
 to create new Algols. Seaond, as an obvious consequence, dissolve Working 
 Group 2.q Third, subject the rules and regulations of IFIP itself to a 
 thorough revision, to achieve a proper flow of information, feedback, 
 and check of authority.

Lest this may give the impression that I consider the 
 whole field of programming languages to be finished or out, 
 I wish to add that I see very important problems crying to be 
 attaoked. To give but one example, I will refer to Comm. ACM 
 January 1968, pp 55 - 56, where, in connection with some critical 
 remarks about PL/~, the urgent need for independent criteria 
 identifying the characteristics of a new generation common 
 computer language is strongly emphasized. Now, who is it that 
 stresses this obvious, basic point, the need for independent 
 criteria? Is it a member of W~ 2.1? No: Or of the IFIP 
 Council? No: Who then? Well, his name is Jack Brooks, congressman 
 of the U.S. This is where we have come to, we have to be told of the 
 basic needs of our activity from a non-professional. I think it is 
 time to stop this hunt for the ultimate monument on which to stick the 
 name Algol, and to get down to the real problems.
