Abstract-- This paper presents a novel fast model-based algorithm for realistic multispectral BTF texture modelling potentially capable of direct implementation inside the graphical card processing unit. The algorithm starts with range map estimation of the BTF texture followed by the spectral and spatial factorisation of an input multispectral texture image. Single orthogonal monospectral band-limited factors are independently modelled by their dedicated Gaussian Markov random field models (GMRF). We estimate an optimal contextual neighbourhood and parameters for each GMRF. Finally single synthesised band-limited factors are collapsed into the fine resolution monospectral images and using the inverse Karhunen-Loeve transformation we obtain the smooth multispectral texture. Both multispectral and range information is combined in a bump mapping or alternatively a displacement mapping filter of the rendering hardware. The presented model offers huge BTF texture compression ration which cannot be achieved by any other sampling-based BTF texture synthesis method.

visible seams, some of them are computationally demanding and they cannot generate textures unseen (unstored) by the algorithm.

I. INTRODUCTION
Photo realism in virtual or mixed reality scenes cannot be accomplished without nature-like colour textures covering visualised scene objects. These textures can be either smooth or rough (also referred as the bidirectional texture function BTF). The rough textures which have rugged surfaces do not obey Lambertian law and their reflectance is illumination and view angle dependent as it is illustrated in Fig.1. Textures can be either digitised natural textures or textures synthesised from an appropriate mathematical model. The former simplistic option suffers among others with extreme memory requirements for storage of a large number of digitised cross-sectioned slices through different material samples. Sampling solution become unmanageable for rough textures which require to store thousands of different illumination and view angle samples for every texture.
Several intelligent sampling methods [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], were proposed with the aim to diminish these huge memory requirements. The method [1] constructs texture in coarseto-fine fashion, preserving conditional distribution of filter outputs over multiple scales, while another multiscale method [4] uses histograms of filter responses. The quilting method [3] is based on the overlapping tiling and subsequent minimum error boundary cut. Similarly the algorithm [5] uses regular tiling combined with a deterministic chaos transformation. All these methods are based on some sort of original small texture sampling and the best of them produce very realistic synthetic textures. However these methods require to store thousands images for every combination of viewing and illumination angle of the original target texture sample, they often produce

Synthetic textures are far more flexible, extremely compressed (few parameters have to be stored only), they may be evaluated directly in procedural form and can be designed to meet certain constraints or properties, so that they can be used to fill an infinite texture space without visible discontinuities.
Several monospectral smooth texture modelling approaches were published, e.g., [7], [8],[9], [10], [11], among them also few colour models, e.g., [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and some survey articles are available [17], [18] as well. Previous colour texture modelling methods either mapped colour to gray tones [19] sacrificing considerable amount of image information or used 3D models [13],[14] with corresponding problems of robust nonlinear estimation of large amount of model parameters.
Modelling multispectral images requires three dimensional models however if we are willing to sacrifice some information a 3D model can be approximated with a set of much simpler 2D models without compromising its visual realism. Among such possible models the Gaussian Markov random fields are appropriate for texture modelling not only because they do not suffer with some problems of alternative options (see [20], [17], [18], [15] for details) but they are also easy to synthesise and still flexible enough to imitate a large set of natural and artificial textures. While the random field based models quite successfully represent high frequencies present in natural textures low frequencies are much more difficult for them. One possibility how to overcome this drawback is to use a multiscale random field model.
Multiple resolution decomposition (MRD) such as Gaussian/Laplacian pyramids, wavelet pyramids or subband pyra-

mids [21] present efficient method for the spatial information compressing. The hierarchy of different resolutions of an image provides a transition between pixel-level features and region or global features and hence such a representation simplify modelling a large variety of possible textures. Unfortunately Markov random fields in general, and Gaussian Markov random fields in particular are not invariant to multiple resolution decomposition (MRD) even for simple MRD like subsampling and the lower-resolution images generally lose their Markovianity. Fortunately we can avoid computationally demanding approximations [22] of a non-Markov multigrid random field by Markov random fields because there is no need to transfer information between single spatial factors hence it is sufficient to analyse and synthesise each resolution component independently.
We propose a novel algorithm for efficient rough texture modelling which combines an estimated range map with synthetic multiscale Markov random field based generated smooth texture. The texture visual appearance during changes of viewing and illumination conditions simulated using the bump / displacement mapping technique. The obvious advantage of this solution is the possibility to use hardware support of bump / displacement map techniques in contemporary visualisation hardware.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. After a description of range map estimation technique, we discuss the underlaying multiscale Markovian smooth texture model together with its parameter estimation and synthesis solutions. Results are reported in Section 3, followed by a conclusion and discussion about future work in Section 4.
II. RANGE MAP ESTIMATION
There are several methods for determining a surface range map. The most accurate range map can be estimated by direct measurement of the observed surface using corresponding range cameras (e.g. laser or structured light based). However this method requires special hardware and measurement methodology. Hence several alternative approaches for range map estimation from surface images were developed. One of them is a Photometric Stereo which estimates surface range map from at least three images obtained for different position of illumination source while the camera position is fixed. Its obvious disadvantage is the requirement to obtain at least three mutually registered images. An alternative option is to use a method from the Shape from Shading group.
The range map estimation of texture images within this paper was performed by shape from shading algorithm published by Frankot & Chellappa [23]. This method exploits the fact that image intensity Yr of each pixel observed in texture image is given according to Lambertian (in our implementation) reflectance map R :

Yr = R(zr1 , zr2 , L, C, )

=

L1zr1 + L2zr2 + L3 L12 + L22 + L32 1 + zr21 + zr22

(1)

where zr1 and zr2 are surface slopes in directions r1 and r2, L is vector from surface to illumination source, C is vector from surface to the camera and  is albedo of observed material. The algorithm ignores multiple reflections, assumes known vectors C, L and spatially invariant reflectance map. The advantage of this method is fast range map estimation from single surface image illuminated by single light source from known position. In comparison with other methods, as for example Horn & Brooks [24], this algorithm includes constrain which enforces integrability of surface slopes (2). These slopes are then updated in each iteration step.

2Zr = 2Zr r1r2 r2r1

(2)

where Zr is the unknown surface height in the location r = (r1, r2). This integrability condition is performed in the Fourier coefficient representation as follows:

C(u, v)

=

1 2

+ -

+
Zr · ej(ur1+vr2)dr1dr2
-

Zr

=

1

+ +
C(u, v) · e-j(ur1+vr2)dudv

2 - -

Based on these assumptions the reconstruction of surface height is performed in the Fourier space with coefficients obtained by the above equation. Frankot & Chellappa proved [23] that the algorithm maps closed convex sets into closed convex sets in each iteration step and thus the estimated surface slopes are integrable. Finally the inverse transformation leads to a surface range map. The Lambertian reflectance assumption may deteriorate the range map estimation for some non-Lambertian texture surfaces, although results in [23] demonstrate still acceptable estimates even in these cases.

III. SMOOTH TEXTURE MODEL
Modelling general multispectral (e.g., colour) texture im-
ages requires three dimensional models. If a 3D data space
can be factorised then these data can be modelled using a
set of less-dimensional 2D random field models, otherwise it
is necessary to use some 3D random field model. Although
full 3D models allows unrestricted spatial-spectral correlation
modelling its main drawback is large amount of parameters to
be estimated and in the case of Markov models (MRF) also
the necessity to estimate all these parameters simultaneously
[13]. The factorisation alternative is attractive because it allows
using simpler 2D data models with less parameters (one third
in the three-spectral case of colour textures).
Spectral factorisation using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion transforms the original centred data space Y~ defined on the rectangular M × N finite toroidal lattice I into a new data space with K-L coordinate axes Y¯ . These new basis vectors are the eigenvectors of the d × d second-order statistical moments matrix  = E{Y~r,·Y~rT,·} where the multiindex r has two components r = [r1, r2], the first component is row and and the second one column index, respectively. The projection of random vector Y~r,· (the notation · has the

meaning of all possible values of the corresponding index)
onto the K-L coordinate system uses the transformation matrix T = [uT1 , . . . , uTd ]T which has single rows uj that are eigenvectors of the matrix .

If the local conditional density of the MRF model (8) is Gaussian, we obtain the continuous Gaussian Markov random field model (GMRF):

Y¯r,· = T Y~r,·

(3)

Components of the transformed vector Y¯r,· (3) are mutually uncorrelated and if Y¯r,· are Gaussian they are also independent hence each transformed monospectral factor can be modelled independently of remaining spectral factors. Texture modelling does not require computationally demanding MRD approximations (e.g. [22]) because it does not need to propagate information between different data resolution levels. It is sufficient to analyse and subsequently generate single spatial frequency bands without assuming a knowledge of some MRFtype global multi-grid model. Input multispectral image is factorised using (3) into d monospectral images Y¯·,i for i = 1, . . . , d. These components are further decomposed into a multi-resolution grid and each resolution data are independently modelled by their dedicated GMRF. Each one generates a single spatial frequency band of the texture. An analysed texture is decomposed into multiple resolutions factors using Laplacian pyramid and the intermediary Gaussian pyramid Y¨·(,ki) which is a sequence of images in which each one is a low-pass down-sampled version of its predecessor. The Gaussian pyramid for a reduction factor n is

Y¨r(,ki ) =rn (Y¨·(,ki-1)  w) k = 1, 2, . . . ,

(4)

where

Y¨·(,0i) = Y¯·,i ,

n denotes down-sampling with reduction factor n and  is the convolution operation. The Laplacian pyramid Yr(,ki ) contains band-pass components and provides a good approximation to
the Laplacian of the Gaussian kernel. It can be constructed by
differencing single Gaussian pyramid layers:

Yr(,ki ) = Y¨r(,ki )- rn (Y¨·(,ki+1))

k = 0, 1, . . . , (5)

where n is the up-sampling with an expanding factor n. Single orthogonal monospectral components are thus de-
composed into a multi-resolution grid and each resolution data are independently modelled by their dedicated Gaussian Markov random field model (GMRF) as follows. The Markov random field (MRF) is a family of random variables with a joint probability density on the set of all possible realisations Y of the lattice I, subject to following conditions:

p(Y·,i) > 0,

Y ,

(6)

and

p(Yr,i | Ys,is  I \ {r}) = p(Yr,i |Ys,is  Ir,i) , (7)

and Ir,i is a contextual support set of the i-th monospectral field.

p(Yr, | Ys,is  Ir,i) =

as,i(Yr-s,i - µr-s,i)

sIr,i

(9)

and i, as,i s  Ir,i are unknown parameters. The 2D MRF model can be expressed as a stationary non-causal correlated noise driven 2D autoregressive process:

Y~r,i =

as,iY~r-s,i + eri,i

sIr,i

(10)

where the noise er,i is random variable with zero mean. The er,i noise variables are mutually correlated

Rei = =

E {er,i er-s,i }
i2 if s = (0, 0), -i2as,i if s  Ir,i, 0 otherwise.

(11)

Correlation functions have the symmetry property E{er,ier+s,i} = E{er,i er-s,i} hence the neighbourhood support set and their associated coefficients have to be symmetric, i.e. s  Ir,i  -s  Ir,i and as,i = a-s,i .

A. Parameter Estimation
The selection of an appropriate GMRF model support is important to obtain good results in modelling of a given random field. If the contextual neighbourhood is too small it can not capture all details of the random field. Inclusion of the unnecessary neighbours on the other hand add to the computational burden and can potentially degrade the performance of the model as an additional source of noise. We use hierarchical neighbourhood system Ir,i, e.g., the first-order neighbourhood is Ir,i = {r - (0, 1), r + (0, 1), r - (1, 0), r + (1, 0)}, etc. An optimal neighbourhood is detected using the correlation method [25] favouring neighbours locations corresponding to large correlations over those with small correlations.
Parameter estimation of a MRF model is complicated by the difficulty associated with computing the normalisation constant. Fortunately the GMRF model is an exception where the normalisation constant is easy obtainable however either Bayesian or ML estimate requires iterative minimisation of a nonlinear function. Therefore we use the pseudo-likelihood estimator which is computationally simple although not efficient. The pseudo-likelihood estimate for as parameters has the form

a,i = [as,i s  Ir,i] =

B. Model Synthesis

(13)

Several possibilities exist [17] for a finite lattice GMRF syn-
thesis. The most effective synthesis method uses the discrete
fast Fourier transformation. GMRF can be generated [9] from Y·,i = F -1{Y^·,i} + Ui, where Ui the mean vector of the whole filed and Y^·,i is generated from the Gaussian generator N (0, N M SY (r, i)) . SY (r, i) is the associated power spectrum [20] and N × M is the underlying generated lattice
size. Single GMRF models synthesise spatial frequency bands
of the texture. Each monospectral fine-resolution component is
obtained from the pyramid collapse procedure (inversion pro-
cess to (4),(5)). Finally the resulting synthesised multispectral
texture is obtained from the set of synthesised monospectral
images using the inverse K-L transformation:

Y~r,· = T -1Y¯r,·

(14)

IV. RESULTS
We have tested the algorithm on BTF colour textures from the CUReT [26] database, several our and the University of Bonn (Fig.2) BTF measurements. Figs.2,4 show corduroy, upholstery and knitwear textures synthesised using the presented method for three illumination angles. For comparison, the included corresponding smooth texture synthesis results using the same sets of models demonstrate clear improvement of the presented approach. All these figures demonstrate also the colour quality of the model. The Fig.3 demonstrates the improvement achieved using the displacement mapping technique (the leftmost three examples) and the comparison between measured and estimated range map results. Our synthesised images manifest comparable colour quality with the much more complex 3D models [14]. The multi-scale models demonstrate [12] their clear superiority over their singlescale counterparts while the colour quality is comparable between single-scale and multi-scale alternative models. The synthesised smooth intensity image is identical for all viewing angles but differs for illumination angle changes.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Our testing results of the algorithm on all available BTF data are encouraging. Some synthetic textures reproduce given measured texture images so that both natural and synthetic texture are almost visually indiscernible. Even the not so successful results can be used for the preattentive BTF textures applications. The overwhelming amount of original colour tones were reproduced realistically in spite of restricted spectral modelling power of the model. The multi-scale approach

is more robust and allows far better results than the singlescale one if the synthesis model is inadequate (lower order model, non stationary texture, etc.). The proposed method allows huge compression ratio (unattainable by alternative intelligent sampling approaches) for transmission or storing texture information while it has still moderate computation complexity. The method does not need any time-consuming numerical optimisation like for example the usually employed Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The replacement of the bump filter technique with the novel graphics cards feature the displacement mapping is expected to further significantly improve the visual quality of our algorithm results.
The presented method is based on the estimated model in contrast to prevailing intelligent sampling type of methods, and as such it can only approximate realism of the original measurement. However it offers unbeatable data compression ratio (tens of parameters per texture only), easy simulation of even non existing (previously not measured) BTF textures and fast seamless synthesis of any texture size.
