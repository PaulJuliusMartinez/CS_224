I. INTRODUCTION
As a generalization of cyclic codes, quasi-cyclic (QC) codes contain many good linear codes. Much work has been done to find good QC codes with the help of computers, and many good QC codes have been found [1]-[4]. It should be noted that an exhaustive search is intractable with the increase in the code dimensions. Gulliver and Bhargava [1]-[3] presented a nonexhaustive method based on the exhaustive method developed by Tilborg [4]. However, it is not feasible to search for codes with large code dimensions, so some other methods should be developed. In this correspondence, a local exhaustive method is used to find good binary QC codes. New QC codes which improve the lower bounds on the minimum distance for a binary linear code are presented, and many other QC codes which attain the best known lower bounds are found.
11. NEWQUASI-CYCLCICODES
A code is said to be quasi-cyclic (QC) if a cyclic shift of any codeword by p positions is still a codeword. Thus, a cyclic code

and the dimension k of V is equal t o the degree of h(x). If h(x) has degree m , the dimension of V is k = m, and (1) is a generator matrix for V . If k < m , a generator matrix for I/ can be constructed by deleting m - k rows of (1). Therefore, a 1-generator QC code is a [ pm, k] code.
The quasi-cyclic structure of the code can be used to simplify the search. The first step is to find all polynomials of degree less than m, which are divisible by another polynomial a ( x ) of
+degree m - k and gcd ( x m 1, a(x)) = a(x). The equivalent
polynomials which generate the equivalent codes are eliminated. The remaining polynomials are grouped according to their weights. Let S,(x) be sets of such polynomials with weight i, i = 1,2;.., m - 1.
The search is initialized with r given generator polynomials c,(x), c1(x);.., c,- ,(x), and an initial value of minimum distance
+ +d. To obtain a QC code with p = r 1, r 2, or r + 3, one,
two, or three more generator polynomials are chosen from one, two, or three sets S,(x) of polynomials, respectively. For exam-
+ple, to obtain QC code with p = r 2 and the minimum dis-
tance > d, two polynomials c,(~> and c,+,(~) must be chosen from two sets of polynomials S,(x) and S,(x), respectively,
where
w t ( c , ( x ) > + wt(c,(x)) + ... +wt(c,-,(x)) + t + q > d .
Only the polynomials in the chosen sets are examined exhaustively. For each possible choice, the program produces its codewords one by one and checks the weights of the produced codewords. If a nonzero codeword with weight less than or equal to d is found, the program continues to examine another choice of polynomials. If no nonzero codewords with weights less than or equal t o d are found, a QC code with the minimum distance
> d is constructed, and the program records the new code and
updates the minimum distance d. This process is repeated until all possible polynomials in the given sets are investigated.
With this local exhaustive search, many good QC codes have been obtained. Among these, six QC codes improve the lower bounds on the minimum distance for a binary linear code, and 19 entries in the table of [6] are thus updated. Table I lists these codes and their generator polynomials in octal, with the least

Abstract-A class of rate Z/b quasi-cyclic codes can be characterized in terms of m x m circulant matrices. In this correspondence, two new
codes with parameters (80,10,35) and (95,10,42) are presented which improve the known lower bound on the maximum possible minimum distance. The former code can be extended with an even parity check bit to an (81, 10, 36) code that establishes that d,(81,10) = 36.

significant coefficient on the right, where d,, is the bound on the minimum distance given in [6].
For example, the best known binary linear code with block
+length n = 60, dimension k = 19 has a minimum distance d =
17. Let a ( x ) = 1 x , c O ( x )= a ( x ) . Then, S,(x) and S J x ) are formed with IS,(x)l = 245 and lS12(x)l= 8509. To find a QC [60, 191 code with minimum distance d = 18 > 17, the program chose two polynomials from S J x ) and S,,(x), respectively. There are 245 X 8509 = 2 084 705 possible choices, and this number of choices can be examined in a short time. A [60, 19, 181code is thus found as listed in Table I. If polynomials are not grouped according to their weights, and an exhaustive method is used, there are still about (219/20)2 = 2.56 X 228 possible choices, although c , ( x ) is given, and it may be impossible to try all of these possibilities.
111. CONCLUSION
A local exhaustive search for good quasi-cyclic codes is presented, and new codes have been constructed which improve the lower bounds on the minimum distance for a binary linear code. From these codes, 19 entries in the table of [6] are thus updated. Many other QC codes which attain the lower bounds have been also obtained, and they are available from the author upon the request.

A linear ( n , k , d ) code C over GF(2) can be represented as the rowspace of a k x n binary generator matrix G with rows composed of k linearly independent codewords of C. One of the most fundamental and challenging problems in coding theory is to find a linear ( n , k ) code achieving the maximum possible minimum distance d , which is the minimum of the Hamming weights of the 2k codewords. This is denoted as d 2 ( n , k ) . A related problem is that of finding the smallest n such that an ( n , k ) code exists with a given d. For binary linear codes, Brouwer and Verhoeff [1] have tabulated bounds on d2(n, k ) for n, k I127. In this correspondence, a subset of the class of quasicyclic codes is investigated to improve these bounds.
A code is called quasi-cyclic (QC) if there is some integer s such that every cyclic shift of a codeword by s places is again a codeword [2], [3]. The generator matrices of many QC codes can be characterized in terms of m X m circulant matrices [2], of the form,
