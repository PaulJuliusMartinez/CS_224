The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene is mutationally inactivated in both familial and sporadic forms of colorectal cancers. In addition, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the upstream portion of APC, a potential alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation, has been described in colorectal cancer. Because a subset of both gastric and colorectal cancers display the CpG island methylator phenotype, we hypothesized that epigenetic inactivation of APC was likely to occur in at least some gastric cancers. APC exhibits two forms of transcripts from exons 1A and 1B in the stomach. Therefore, we investigated CpG island methylation in the sequences upstream of exons 1A and 1B, i.e., promoters 1A and 1B, respectively. We evaluated DNAs from 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 40 primary gastric cancers, and 40 matching non-cancerous gastric mucosae. Methylated alleles of promoter 1A were present in 10 (100%) of 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 33 (82.5%) of 40 primary gastric cancers, and 39 (97.5%) of 40 noncancerous gastric mucosae. In contrast, promoter 1B was unmethylated in all of these same samples. APC transcripts from exon 1A were not expressed in nine of the 10 methylated gastric cancer cell lines, whereas APC transcripts were expressed from exon 1B. Thus, expression from a given promoter correlated well with its methylation status. We conclude that in contrast to the colon, methylation of promoter 1A is a normal event in the stomach; moreover, promoter 1B is protected from methylation in the stomach and thus probably does not participate in this form of epigenetic APC inactivation.

Introduction
The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene, isolated and mapped to chromosomal band 5q21 (Joslyn et al., 1991; Kinzler et al., 1991), is responsible not only for the hereditary cancer syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, but also

for sporadic colorectal cancer development due to mutations within its coding sequence (Nishisho et al., 1991; Miyoshi et al., 1992a,b). When the APC protein binds to b-catenin, it promotes the phosphorylation of highly conserved serine and threonine residues in bcatenin's NH2 terminus by GSK-3, thereby targeting b-catenin for degradation via the proteosome system (Papko et al., 1996; Orford et al., 1997). Loss of APC function results in nuclear accumulation of b-catenin, which acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to the Tcf ± Lef (T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) family of transcription factors, ultimately leading to loss of cellular growth control (Morin et al., 1997; Sparks et al., 1998). Truncating mutations in APC, with concordant loss of the wild-type allele, occur frequently and early in colorectal tumorigenesis (Miyoshi et al., 1992b). Despite frequent heterozygous deletion involving the APC locus on chromosome 5q21 in gastric cancers (Rhyu et al., 1994; Tamura et al., 1996; Nishizuka et al., 1998), APC mutations have been reported infrequently in gastric and other extracolonic gastrointestinal cancers (Ogasawara et al., 1994; Powell et al., 1994, 1996).
Recently, it was reported that aberrant DNA methylation of promoter region CpG islands can serve as an alternative mechanism to coding region mutations for the inactivation of tumor suppressor or tumorrelated genes, including retinoblastoma (Rb), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), p16, p15, hMLH1, and Ecadherin (Gra et al., 1997; Herman et al., 1998; Tamura et al., 2000). In addition, APC 5' region hypermethylation has been reported in colorectal cancers (Hiltunen et al., 1997). In gastric cancers, promoter CpG island hypermethylation of p16, hMLH1, and E-cadherin has been reported (Fleisher et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 1999; Tamura et al., 2000). Because a subset of gastric and colorectal cancers display a CpG island methylator phenotype (Toyota et al., 1999a,b), we hypothesized that APC is inactivated through promoter hypermethylation in both of these cancer types.
In order to test this hypothesis, we studied APC gene promoter methylation status in DNAs from 10 gastric cancer cell lines and 40 primary gastric cancers, as well as in 40 matching non-cancerous gastric mucosae by using the methylation-speci®c PCR (MSP) technique. Because APC expresses multiple transcripts in a tissuespeci®c manner, and because two forms of transcripts

originating from exons 1A and 1B have been identi®ed in the stomach (Horii et al., 1993), we investigated CpG island methylation in the regions upstream of exons 1A and 1B. We studied promoter 1A, deposited at Genbank as accession No. U02509; and promoter 1B (accession No. D13981), respectively.
Results
Methylation status of promoters 1A and 1B, and expression of APC mRNA in gastric cancer cell lines
The methylation status of promoters 1A and 1B was determined by MSP (Herman et al., 1996) using methylated and unmethylated sequence-speci®c primers (Figure 1). Methylated APC alleles of promoter 1A were present in all 10 gastric cancer cell lines examined (Figure 2). In eight cell lines (MKN1, MKN7, MKN28, MKN45, MKN74, KATO-III, ECC10 and ECC12), only the methylated allele was present, suggesting biallelic or complete hypermethylation (i.e., occurring in all cells). It is also possible that some of these cell lines had lost one of two parental alleles by loss of heterozygosity and that methylation aected the remaining allele. However, two cell lines, KWS-I and TSG11 (derived from a poorly dierentiated adenocarcinoma and a hepatoid carcinoma cell line, respectively), showed the presence of both methylated and unmethylated alleles, suggesting monoallelic or heterogenous hypermethylation (e.g., occurring in a subpopulation of cells). Methylation status at 1AM1 agreed with that at 1AM2 (Figure 1) in all cell lines tested (Figure 2). Direct sequencing of the methylated DNA PCR product from KATO-III cells con®rmed the retention of cytosines at all CpGs within the PCR product (Figure 3), whereas cytosines were all converted to thymines in normal mucosal DNA after bisul®te treatment (data not shown). No methylated APC alleles of promoter 1B were present in any of the 10 gastric cancer cell lines examined (Figure 4). Transcripts from exon 1A were detected only in KWS-I cells by RT ± PCR, and those from exon 1B were found in 9 of 10 cell lines except for KATO-III (Figure 5). Results of RT ± PCR of exons 6 ± 10 to test mRNA expression levels were concordant with those of

exon 1B (Figure 5). Levels of APC expression were nearly concordant with the methylation status of promoters 1A and 1B as detected by MSP (Table 1), except that TSG11 cells had lost expression from exon 1A despite the fact that both methylated and unmethylated alleles were present, and KATO-III had lost expression from exon 1B despite the unmethylated status of promoter 1B.

in matching non-cancerous DNA, was observed in only one (2.5%) of 40 cases. Hypomethylation in cancer DNA, i.e. lack of methylation in cancer DNA and methylation in matching non-cancerous DNA, was observed in seven (17.5%) of 40 cases. In contrast, no methylated alleles of promoter 1B were detected in any cancerous or non-cancerous DNAs.
Unmethylated alleles of promoters 1A and 1B (1AU and 1UB) (Figure 1) were present in all the cancerous and non-cancerous DNAs. Methylation status at 1AM1 was completely in agreement with that of 1AM2 (Figure 1). One exceptional tumor showed hypermethylation at 1AM1, but was unmethylated at 1AM2. The methylation status of promoter 1A did not correlate with histological type, stage, age or sex in primary gastric cancers.
Discussion
Hypermethylation in only one of the two described APC promoters, promoter 1A, was studied in a report on colorectal cancers (Hiltunen et al., 1997), although two forms of transcripts from exons 1A exon 1B were also expressed in the normal colon, in agreement with our ®ndings in the normal stomach (Horii et al., 1993). We found a signi®cant dierence between noncancerous colorectal and gastric mucosae in the methylation status of promoter 1A. Promoter 1A

was methylated in 97.5% of non-cancerous gastric mucosae in our study. However, heavy CpG methylation was found in colorectal cancers, but not in adenomas or normal colonic mucosae, suggesting the involvement of APC gene promoter hypermethylation in the progression of colorectal cancers (Hiltunen et al., 1997). To further investigate the methylation status of promoter 1A in non-cancerous tissues, we studied non-cancerous DNAs from ®ve samples of peripheral blood, ®ve colonic samples, and 10 breast samples from cancer-bearing and non-bearing individuals. No methylated alleles of promoter 1A were present in any of the DNA samples listed above, using an identical MSP procedure (data not shown). Therefore, this hypermethylation can be considered tissuespeci®c. We also studied DNAs of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon from autopsies of a 28-week stillborn infant and a 16-year-old female, and found an absence of methylated alleles of promoter 1A (data not shown). These results, coupled with the high prevalence of methylation of promoter 1A in non-cancerous gastric mucosae, suggest that methylation of this promoter in the normal stomach may constitute an age-related event.
Although promoter 1A was frequently methylated in the normal stomach, APC was still expressed from exon 1B because promoter 1B was never methylated. Thus, methylation of promoter 1A alone does not appear to be oncogenic in the stomach. Sp1 elements, which can protect promoter CpG islands from methylation, exist in both promoters 1A and 1B, and hypermethylation probably originates within the ¯anking regions of the CpG island (Gra et al., 1997). The distinct methylation patterns observed in normal stomach may be the result of positional dierences between these two promoters, or of other mechanisms for CpG island protection.
We detected methylated alleles of promoter 1A in both cancerous and non-cancerous gastric tissues in the majority of cases (80%, or 32/40). Hypomethylation of cancer DNA relative to matching normal control DNA was observed in seven (17.5%) of 40 cases in our study. It is noteworthy that hypomethylation of the hMLH1 promoter has recently been described in colorectal cancers (Kuismanen et al., 1999). However, it is possible that hypomethylation of promoter 1A observed in the present study might simply represent a passenger event during the malignant transformation of unmethylated cells.

showed an identical methylation pattern, i.e. methylation of promoter 1A and nonmethylation of promoter 1B. Transcripts from exon 1A were absent and those from exon 1B and exons 6 ± 10 were present in all of these cell lines, except for KATO-III. The absence of APC transcripts in KATO-III is concordant with loss of APC protein reported in a previous study (Nishimura et al., 1995). KWS-I and TSG11 cell lines exhibited both methylated and unmethylated alleles of promoter 1A; however, transcripts from exon 1A were observed only in KWS-I. These results raise the possibility that mechanisms other than promoter methylation resulted in the absence of APC expression.
In conclusion, promoter 1A of the APC gene frequently undergoes methylation in non-cancerous and malignant gastric mucosae in a tissue-speci®c manner, while promoter 1B is protected from changes in methylation in the stomach. Abnormal methylation involving APC, including both hyper- and hypomethylation of APC promoters in other tissue types, appears to merit further investigation.
Materials and methods
Cell lines and tissues
Ten gastric cancer cell lines with diering histologies were cultured under appropriate conditions in our laboratory; MKN1, an adenosquamous cell carcinoma; MKN7, a well dierentiated adenocarcinoma; MKN28 and MKN74, moderately dierentiated adenocarcinomas, MKN45 and KWS-I; poorly dierentiated adenocarcinomas; KATO-III, a signet ring cell carcinoma; ECC10 and ECC12, endocrine cell carcinomas; and TSG11, a hepatoid carcinoma (Motoyama et al., 1986). Forty gastric cancers and their matching normal gastric mucosae were obtained surgically from 40 Japanese patients. The tumors included 13 dierentiated and 27 undierentiated carcinomas histologically, and constituted 19 early and 21 advanced cancers. As controls, we investigated samples from autopsies of a 28-week stillborn infant, a 16-year-old female, as well as ®ve normal colonic mucosae, 10 normal breast tissues and ®ve peripheral blood samples. The samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen after resection and stored at 7808C until processing. Genomic DNA and mRNA were extracted using standard procedures.
Methylation-specific PCR
DNA methylation patterns in two APC promoters, namely promoter 1A and promoter 1B, were determined by MSP (Herman et al., 1996). MSP distinguishes unmethylated from methylated alleles of a given gene based on sequence changes produced following bisul®te treatment of DNA, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils, while leaving methylated cytosines unaected. Subsequent PCR using primers speci®c to sequences that correspond to either methylated or unmethylated DNA sequences was then performed. Primer sequences used were 1AM1f (5'-TGTTTTGCGGATTTTTTTC-3'; nt 551 ± 569) and 1AM1r (5'-GCAATAAAACACAAAACCCCG-3'; nt 686 ± 706) (158 bp), 1AM2f (5'-TATTGCGGAGTGCGGGTC-3'; nt 701 ± 718) and 1AM2r (5'-TCGACGAACTCCCGACGA-3'; nt 781 ± 798) (100 bp) for methylated DNA sequences of promoter 1A, 1BM1f (5'-TGTTTAGGTAGTAATGGTTTAC-3'; nt 51 ± 72) and 1BM1r (5'-TAAAACCTATTATACGCAAACG-3'; nt 122 ± 143) (95 bp), 1BM2f (5'-GGATTTGCGGGTTTAGGTTC-3'; nt 279 ± 298) and 1BM2r (5'-CATAAAAAACGCCGAAACCCG-3'; nt 388 ± 408) (132 bp) for methylated DNA sequences of promoter 1B and exon 1B, respectively

and 1AUf (5'-GTGTTTTATTGTGGAGTGTGGGTT-3'; nt 695 ± 718) and 1AUr (5'-CCAATCAACAAACTCCCAACAA-3'; nt 781 ± 802) (110 bp) for unmethylated DNA sequences of promoter 1A, 1BUf (5'-GGTTGTTTAGGTAGTAATGGTTTAT-3'; nt 48 ± 72) and 1BUr (5'-AAACTAAAACCTATTATACACAAACA-3'; nt 122 ± 147) (102 bp) for unmethylated DNA sequences of promoter 1B (Genbank Accession No. U02509 and D13981). These regions are shown in Figure 1. Brie¯y, 2 microgram of genomic DNA was denatured by treatment with NaOH and modi®ed by sodium bisul®te. DNA samples were then puri®ed using Wizard DNA puri®cation resin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), treated with NaOH, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 30 ml water. Modi®ed DNAs were ampli®ed in a total volume of 20 m1 16GeneAmp PCR Gold Buer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) containing 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1 mM each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and one unit Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase, PE Applied Biosystems). After activation of the Taq polymerase at 958C for 10 min, PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp 2400, PE Applied Biosystems) for 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 958C for 15 s, annealing at 608C for 15 s, and extension at 728C for 30 s, followed by a ®nal 7-min extension at 728C for all primer-sets. PCR products were then loaded onto non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV illumination.

Preparation of positive control
100 mg of peripheral blood DNA was treated according to the manufacturer's protocol (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) by Sss I Methylase. Sss I-treated DNA was modi®ed by sodium bisul®te as described above.

Reverse-transcription PCR
APC transcripts from exon 1A and exon 1B as well as of exon 6 ± 10 were analysed by RT ± PCR in the 10 gastric cancer cell lines. One microgram of total RNA isolated from the cell lines was reverse-transcribed by AMV RTase XL (Takara, Kyoto) at 428C for 30 min, and then ampli®ed by PCR as described above. Primer sequences were: NA (5'-GGAGACAGAATGGAGGTGC-3') and mdf-APC5 (5'-CAACTGATCATATGAAGCTGCAGCCAT-3') (75 bp), NB (5'GCGAGCAGGAGCTGCGT-3') and mdf-APC5 (5'-CAACTGATCATATGAAGCTGCAGCCAT-3') (108 bp) (Horii et al., 1993), mdf-exon6 (5'-AGAATAGCCAGAATTCAGCAAATCG-3') and mdf-exon10 (5'-GAAAGTTTCATTAGAACACACACAG-3') (718 bp) for APC (Oshima et al., 1993), and b-actin-sense (5'-CCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC-3') and b-actin-antisense (5'-CTGTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTAG3') (436 bp).

Sequencing
The methylated DNA-derived PCR product from KATO-III and unmethylated PCR product from normal DNA (extracted from the peripheral blood of a healthy volunteer) were directly sequenced using the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems) and an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 310, PE Applied Biosystems).
