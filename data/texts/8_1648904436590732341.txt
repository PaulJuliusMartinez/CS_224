Abstract -- We have designed and fabricated airbridged optical modulator/detectors with modulation bandwidth exceeding 15GHz, the highest yet reported for InGaAsP/InGaAsP MQW AFPMDs. Wavelength dependence of the modulated output power at microwave frequencies is reported for the first time and the wide optical bandwidths (> 17nm) so measured suggest that the AFPMD can be used with low-cost uncooled CWDM lasers in radio-over-fibre applications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) electroabsorption modulator/detectors (EAMDs) are important in future radio-over-fibre applications as simple low-cost electrical/optical transceivers [1][2]. In particular, the normal-incidence asymmetric Fabry-Perot modulator/detector (AFPMD) possesses a number of advantages over the waveguide type EAMD, including polarisation insensitivity and low optical insertion loss due to a large (20µm diameter) optical window compared to the small cross-sectional area of the waveguide EAMD. Previously, we reported a 10GHz InGaAsP/InGaAsP multiple quantum well (MQW) AFPMD and performed static and microwave characterisations, bi-directional broadband wireless over fibre transmissions with the AFPMD functioning as both an optical modulator and a photodetector, and the first direct integration with a microstrip patch antenna for

operation at 5.2GHz [3]. We have since modified the device epitaxial design by incorporating a highly pdoped InGaAs cap layer for low contact resistance. The mask design has also been enhanced with a novel feature which will allow AFPMDs with the required resonance wavelength to be selected using a simple and efficient reflection microscope arrangement before the expensive and time-consuming cleaving and packaging processes. In this paper we report on this new AFPMD which has modulation bandwidth exceeding 15GHz, the highest reported to date for InGaAsP/InGaAsP MQW AFPMDs. We also report for the first time the dependence of the AFPMD modulated output power on the incident optical wavelength.
II. DEVICE STRUCTURE
The AFPMD layer structure shown in Fig. 1 was grown by MOVPE on a semi-insulating InP substrate and consisted (from the top of the grown wafer) of a highly p-doped InGaAs cap layer, a p-doped 2-period top DBR, an intrinsic 30-period InGaAsP/InGaAsP MQW absorbing region and finally an n-doped 20-period bottom DBR. All layers were lattice matched to the InP substrate. The excitonic absorption peak of the MQW region is at a wavelength of approximately 1520nm at 0V bias. The top InGaAs cap layer is used only for low resistance metallisation and so is not part of the AFPMD optical structure. This InGaAs layer was etched away from the optical window during device fabrication.

The asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavity is formed between the highly reflective (91%) bottom DBR and a partially reflective (35%) top mirror consisting of the air-InP interface and the top DBR. The cavity length is such that destructive interference occurs at the resonance or operating wavelength between the light reflected from the top mirror and that from the bottom DBR.
The wafer was processed into air-bridged AFPMDs with mesa diameter around 35µm. Fig. 2 shows the AFPMD schematic cross-section while Fig. 3 shows a top microscopic photo of the device.

The metal system used for the p-layer contact pad, the 5µm wide air-bridges and the ring on the AFPMD mesa was 20nm/250nm Cr/Au while 20nm/300nm GeAu/Au was used for the n-layer contact pad. Because of the small optical window (20 µm in diameter), two slots

were included in the ring design in order to aid the metal lift-off after the p-layer contact metallisation.
Being a Fabry-Perot cavity structure, the AFPMD resonance wavelength is sensitive to the epitaxial layer thicknesses and varies across a typical two-inch MOVPE grown wafer from which devices are fabricated. It is therefore important to be able to measure and select readily AFPMDs with the correct resonance wavelength before the expensive and time-consuming cleaving and packaging processes. Two large (50µm diameter) pads, having the same layer structure as the AFPMD mesa within the optical window, have therefore been included in the design and can be optically assessed in order to determine their respective resonance wavelengths with an optical spectrum analyser and a simple reflection microscope arrangement whose light spot size is, however, too large for assessing the 20µm AFPMD optical window directly. Therefore the resonance wavelength of the AFPMD mesa itself can be deduced by interpolating those of the two neighbouring 50µm pads. The AFPMD selected for use in this work has resonance wavelength at 1557nm.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The selected AFPMD was cleaved and mounted on a brass block. The n-layer contact pad was connected with silver epoxy to the brass block, which acted as the signal ground. Silver epoxy was also used to connect the p-layer contact pad to the centre of a 2cm long 50 characteristic impedance microstrip transmission line with SMA connectors at both ends. One of the SMA connectors was terminated in a 50 resistor through a DC blocking capacitor while the other connected to a microwave signal source through a bias-tee.
Since both the unmodulated light is incident on and the modulated light is reflected from the AFPMD through the single optical window, a lensed fibre and an optical circulator were used to couple and separate these

two optical signals. Fig. 4 shows the reflected optical power spectrum, including the 2dB optical circulator loss, as the input tuneable laser wavelength was varied from 1470nm to 1584nm.

At 0V bias, the optical insertion loss is 7dB including the 2dB loss of the circulator used. At 3.4V bias, the modulation slope, -dR/dV, is 3.2%/V, where dR is the incremental change in optical reflectance and dV the incremental change in terminal voltage, and the responsivity is 0.28A/W. The reflectance contrast ratio is about 2dB.

The ripples seen in Fig. 6 are due to the microwave test package used. The device -3dB electrical modulation bandwidth exceeds 15GHz which to the authors' knowledge is the highest reported for an InGaAsP/InGaAsP MQW AFPMD. In other material systems, Barron et al [4] reported 37GHz bandwidth for their 80-period GaAs/AlGaAs MQW AFPM at 864nm wavelength while Huang et al [5] reported 20GHz bandwidth for their 50-period InGaAs/InAlAs MQW AFPM at 1.55µm wavelength.
The dependence of the AFPMD modulated output power on the input laser wavelength was investigated. The AFPMD was modulated at 10GHz while the input CW laser wavelength was tuned from 1470nm to 1584nm. A lightwave signal analyser (LSA) with an input responsivity of 0.81A/W was used to detect the AFPMD output modulated optical power and the results are shown in Fig. 7 at four incident optical power levels.

Fig. 7. Wavelength dependence of the detected 10GHz AFPMD modulated output power.

Peak AFPMD modulated powers were detected between 1560.5nm and 1563.5nm, depending on the incident optical power. The optical bandwidths, defined as the wavelength range within which the detected AFPMD modulated power is within -3dB (elec.) of the peak detected power value, are 18, 17.5, 18 and 19nm at input optical powers of -6, -3, 0 and +3dBm, respectively. Such wide AFPMD optical bandwidths can therefore relax the light source wavelength stability requirement and allow the use of low-cost uncooled CWDM lasers.
It is also observed in Fig. 7 that the detected modulated signals at 10GHz exhibit minima between 1533nm and 1535nm. These minima can be explained by noting that if the input laser wavelength coincides with that of the underlying MQW excitonic absorption peak at a given reserve bias voltage, the AFPMD modulation slope ­dR/dV will be zero and detected modulated output power at the fundamental frequency of 10GHz will also be minimum. To substantiate this explanation for the observed minima, we recall a QCSE rule that the wavelength of the excitonic peak red-shifts with increasing electric field strength in the MQW. The measurements of the detected AFPMD modulated power at 10GHz were repeated at four different reverse bias voltages at a fixed incident optical power of -6dBm and the results are shown in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8. Wavelength dependence of the detected 10GHz AFPMD modulated output power at different reverse bias voltages.

It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the observed minima do indeed red-shift with increasing reverse bias voltage with an average shift of about 4.3nm/V and the explanation given above for the observed minima in the detected modulated signal power is thus supported.
The results presented so far were obtained with an unpackaged AFPMD. A number of AFPMDs have now been packaged in modules as shown in Fig. 9 which provide high-speed electrical and FC/PC connectorised optical connections to the AFPMD.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have fabricated air-bridged modulator/detectors with modulation bandwidths exceeding 15GHz, the highest yet reported for InGaAsP/InGaAsP MQW AFPMDs. The variation in the AFPMD modulated output power at microwave frequencies with input laser wavelength is shown to be less than 3dB over greater than 17nm, making the devices compatible with low-cost CWDM technology.
