Abstract Five metrics for scene change detection in video sequencesare presented.Metrics previously applied to this problem are surveyed, and are quantitatively compared to the new metrics. Results show that the proposedmetricsare superior.
1 Introduction To create indexed video databases, video sequences are first segmented into scenes, a process that is referred to
as scenechangedetection.Abrupt scene changes result from joining two dissimilar scenes, and this transition occurs over a single frame. Gradual transitions occur over multiple frames and are the product of special effects, such as fades and dissolves. To detect scene changes in a sequence, a test metric is computed from two adjacent images and a decision is made by thresholding the metric. The objectives of this work are: to survey the metrics previously applied to this problem, to present 5 new metrics, and to quantitatively compare the metrics.

metrics (A and y ) are more robust with respect to
lighting changes, especially if normalized like y, and are sensitive to large inter-frame changes due to motion and camera zooming and panning.

2 Test Metrics The metrics considered fall into three categories. First, are those based on the scene lighting distribution or histograms. Second, are those based on first and second order intensity statistics. Third, are template based metrics where the structure of the images are compared. Metrics based on object motion are not considered due to their high computational complexity.
Table 1 summarizes the metrics surveyed and those that are new. The mathematical symbols that describe the metrics are summarized as follows: p=intensity
mean, 0 =intensity standard deviation, hj (0)=
histogram of image j, Z(x, y; j) =intensity of point (x, y) of the jth image, ( j, k )=indices of 2 sequential
images, and nj =number of pixels in imagej.
The intensity metrics (x2, 6,/2, F, and 771-3) are
sensitive to lighting disturbances, such as flicker, that can cause false positives. Metrics based on first and second order statistics are better than the histogram metrics in this respect. The intensity metrics are invariant to large changes in object motion that do not significantly alter the light distribution. Template based

The metrics may be computed globally, or for 0 subblocks of the image. The latter complicates the decision making process, since the decision is made from the 0 values. An effective approach is to compute the median of the 0 values and use it as the metric. The sub-block

comparison is particularly helpful in sequences with a large amount of motion. However, the global comparisons require less computation time than the sub-block comparisons.
3 Quantitative Comparison The metrics were tested on a video database containing 416 frames: 340 pairs representing no change and 75 abrupt changes. Gradual transitions are considered later. The videos were drawn from movies, commercials, newsclips, and cartoons. For each metric a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) [4] was computed, and a threshold selected to minimize the total error probability. The following measures were used to compare the metrics: At=area above ROC
(smaller is better), pe =minimum error probability,
p fn =false alarm probability, Pd =detection
probability. The results are summarized in Table 2 for grayscale images (A&256). (
The template metrics have the lowest error probabilities for the global comparison, the best rates achieved by y . The histogram and statistic metrics have the lowest error probabilities for the sub-block comparison. The best overall metrics are the F-test and
the 3 new metrics ~1-3. All metrics were also applied

in terms of maximizing r for fades and dissolves. A is good for detecting fades, but not dissolves.

to the same database, where 6 bit color coded images were used [2,3]. The results indicate no significant advantage of the color coded images.
In gradual transitions the metrics usually exhibit a slight sustained increase that is difficult to detect by thresholding. Using twin-comparison [3] and related approaches they are detected by locating this sustained increase. For reliable detection, the metric values during the transition must be large relative to the values preceding it. It was determined which metrics exhibited the largest relative increase. This was done by computing the average metric value during each gradual transition and comparing it to the average value preceding the transition (3 samples directly preceding
each transition were used). The ratio, Y = 7, was
computed for each of the transitions. &, and & are the average metric values before and during the edit respectively, and large values of r are desired. r was computed from a database containing 6 fades and 7 dissolves, and the results are summarized in Table 3. Global comparisons are shown since they are superior to the sub-block comparisons. ;1,vI, and 773 are best

3 Conclusions This work presented 5 metrics for detecting scene changes. y is a good global metric for detecting abrupt
cuts. The F-test and ~1-3 perform the best overall for
abrupt cuts, but require more computation time. These metrics were also applied to the detection of gradual transitions. y did not perform well for gradual transitions, but the statistic based metrics did.
