COURSE DESCRIPTION "If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry," writes Emily Dickinson. As one of the most compressed art forms, poetry relies on rich and sensuous imagery to convey meaningful experiences that have the power to evoke in us both genuine feeling and deep, often philosophical, thought. As with all art, poetry provides a mechanism to explore the complexities of our own existence as well as to step outside ourselves to understand others. This is especially important in our voyage around the world, as students will be asked to utilize their imagination to relate to foreign cultures, customs, and beliefs. Students will learn the art of reading--and enjoying-- poetry. They will be exposed to a rich and diverse selection from many cultures, countries, and ethnicities. As students attend to the nuances of context, tone, imagery, metaphor, symbol, form, and diction, they will expand their sensibilities and sharpen their imaginative capabilities. Through class discussion and various writing assignments, they will also improve their critical thinking and writing skills.

COURSE OBJECTIVES To teach students an appreciation of the many and lasting pleasures of poetry. To demonstrate how poetry, in exercising the imagination, teaches readers not only to peer deeply
within themselves, but also to step outside themselves to increase their awareness and understanding of others. To introduce students to the formal elements of poetry, such as diction, imagery, tone, figurative language, symbol, rhythm, arrangement, as a means to elucidate not only the meaning of a poem but also the "how" of it, the way in which its form expresses its content. To introduce students not only to American poets, but also to a spectrum of international voices. To hone students' critical thinking and analytical skills through discussion and expository writing.

FIELD WORK Wednesday, 2 April 2014, Cape Town, South African Poets In the morning, we will travel to the Book Lounge, a popular bookstore located in City Centre that hosts numerous literary events throughout the year. We will meet with several practicing South African poets, who will read from their work and discuss both their own poetry and South African poetry in general. In the afternoon, we will travel to the University of Cape Town where we will have lunch with some University students interested in creative writing. Then we will attend a poetry reading/workshop with renowned South African writer and poet Joan Hambridge. She will read from her poetry and discuss her sources of inspiration and the various techniques of composition. She will then conduct a brief poetry workshop.

ACADEMIC OBJECTIVES 1. To learn about and meet practicing South African poets 2. To discover their sources of inspiration, methods of composition, struggles, and rewards 3. To gain an appreciation not only of their poetry, but also of South African poetry in general 4. To benefit personally from this encounter, especially through a question-and-answer session and
workshop

FIELD ASSIGNMENT Since the Field Lab constitutes 20% of the coursework, students will be required to write a critical essay on their experience. In particular, they will be asked to select several works by the poets we have met and to discuss critically their response to their work, especially in light of what they, as students, have learned both during the Field Lab and in the course. What modes of expression have the poets chosen and why are they appropriate? How has the social and political background of South Africa affected their poetry? How well do these poets employ the various elements of poetry we have studied, such as diction, imagery, rhythm, closed or open form, metaphor, simile, irony, and/or symbol? How well do their poems attain a universal level of expression?

METHODS OF EVALUATION / GRADING RUBRIC 20% Class participation/attendance (the Socratic method of teaching will be employed and students
will be encouraged to volunteer their contributions to class discussion, and not simply respond when called upon) 30% Two in-class essays and/or examinations 30% Two formal critical essays 20% Field-Lab Assignment
