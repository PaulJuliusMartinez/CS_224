Abstract: Suppression of ASE noise on zeros (25% SD reduction) in 40 Gb/s transmission and wavelength conversion at 40 Gb/s is demonstrated, using a reduced energy (4 MeV) ion-implanted InGaAsP MQW saturable absorber that requires no post-implant fabrication.

Introduction Semiconductor saturable absorbers offer a simple technique for passive optical regeneration, contributing to increased bit rates and error-free distances in periodically amplified optical transmission systems [1, 2], with up to 40 Gb/s RZ transmission recently reported [3]. Such absorbers generally involve high energy (>10MeV) ion implantation and complex fabrication procedures, such as substrate removal.
In this work we report a multiple quantum well (MQW) InGaAsP saturable absorber (SA) integrated in a Fabry-Perot cavity. The device requires no substrate removal and is implanted at moderate energies (4MeV). We report the ability of the SA to reduce accumulated amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise in a 40 Gb/s back-to-back system. We also demonstrate 40 Gb/s wavelength conversion in MQW saturable absorbers for the first time.
Device description The structure was grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) and consists of a 16 period InGaAsP/InP distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) followed by a 50 period InGaAsP Q1.1/Q1.6 multiple quantum well (MQW) structure. The airsemiconductor interface and the DBR form the FabryPerot cavity with the antiresonance at 1534nm. Excitonic absorption bleaching in the MQW is the saturable absorption mechanism. Operation close to the antiresonance and impedance matching conditions [4] is used to increase the contrast ratio of the device. To reduce the recovery time, the wafer was implanted with 4MeV nitrogen ions at a dose of 1012 cm-2. Ion implantation reduces the recovery time by creating defects along the ion traces that act as fast carrier-trapping and recombination centres. At 4MeV energy the nitrogen ions pass through the MQW and stop in the DBR region.
In order to determine the temporal response of the SA we used a standard pump-probe system with 2ps

pulses generated from a mode-locked fibre laser at 4MHz repetition rate. The 1/e recovery time of the SA was reduced from 6ns (as-grown) to 6ps after the implantation.

Noise suppression ASE noise was added to a 40 Gb/s signal in a backto-back transmission experiment to simulate the ASE penalty in transmission. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The input optical signal was a 27-1 pseudorandum bit sequence (PRBS) of 40 Gb/s from a LiNbO3 modulator, driven by a pulse pattern generator. The operating wavelength of the source was 1535nm, the shape of the pulses was sech2 and the pulse-width was 10ps. An EDFA was used as the ASE noise source. A variable optical attenuator following the EDFA was used to adjust the noise level. The 40 Gb/s signal and the EDFA noise were combined in a 3dB coupler, filtered and amplified in a variable gain EDFA. A 3nm bandwidth optical filter before the SA was used to filter the noise spectrum. The signal was pre-amplified to maintain constant average power of 11dBm into the receiver.
The average 40 Gb/s signal power was ­4.3dBm at the output of the coupler, while the noise level was set to -32dBm / 0.1nm. The BER was measured while sweeping the decision voltage at the receiver. The Q factor was estimated from the BER assuming a Gaussian noise distribution.

Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the Q factor on the total average power incident on the SA. At low powers, the device acts as an extra loss in the system. With increasing power, the absorption in the MQW is saturated by the RZ pulses, resulting in a clear improvement in Q compared to the case without the SA for average power >17dBm.

The measured Q factor is plotted with decision voltage for 18dBm average power input in Fig. 3. The slope of the curve is inversely proportional to the standard deviation of noise on zeros (positive slope) and ones (negative slope) [5]. With the SA in the system a 25% reduction in the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution of zeros was measured, indicating suppression of the added noise on zeros.

Wavelength conversion To demonstrate the switching capability of the device we replaced the EDFA with a CW source operating at 1535nm and tuned the 40 Gb/s signal to 1538nm. The 2nm bandwidth filter was omitted from the

Normalised Power

system for this experiment. The average power of the CW source was 10dB less than that for the 40 Gb/s signal at the output of the coupler. Two optical filters of 1nm bandwidth and 0.7nm bandwidth were added in cascade before the pre-amplifier to isolate the wavelength converted signal from the 40 Gb/s pump. Another EDFA was added before the filters to compensate for the extra loss in the system. The average power of the pump signal after filtering was 35.6dB below that of the converted signal.
The wavelength converted output for 15dBm total average input power is shown in Fig. 4. Clearly, the 40 Gb/s PRBS pattern has been transferred to the 1538nm-CW input. The performance is limited due to patterning occurring on ones and there is also some residual CW power on zeros because at 1535nm the device is not exactly at antiresonance. The former can be reduced by introducing a compression fibre [3], while the latter can be eliminated by adjusting the etalon thickness.

Conclusions We successfully demonstrated suppression of ASE noise and wavelength conversion at 40 Gb/s using an MQW saturable absorber monolithically integrated in a Fabry-Perot cavity. The new device offers the advantages of requiring no post-implant fabrication and using moderate implantation energy.
