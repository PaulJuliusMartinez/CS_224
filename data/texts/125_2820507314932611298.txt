smaller numbers of organisms were recovered; the ciprofloxacin dose was further increased to 800 mg q8h (49 mg/[krd]). By hospital day 18, the CSF had become sterile, and cultures continued to be negative throughout the remaining hospital course. An MRI of the lumbar spine obtained on hospital day 19 revealed L4-5 diskitis, L4-5 osteomyelitis, and two L3-4 epidural abscesses; these conditions had improved when a follow-up MRI was obtained 3 weeks later. Antibiotic therapy was completed on hospital day 52.
Infections due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, particularly those involving the CNS, present a therapeutic challenge to clinicians. Studies of quinolones have demonstrated that the peak serum concentration or area under the serum concentration time curve

(AUC)-to-MIC ratio are important predictors of outcome [3]. In the case reported herein, high-dose iv ciprofloxacin (800 mg q8h) therapy resulted in a serum AUC24/MIC ratio of 189, and the serum and CSF peak/MIC ratios were 8.4 and 2.6, respectively. CSF penetration from plasma was 31%. Seizures did not occur even at a peak CSF concentration of 2.6 mg/mL, a level six times higher than the maximum concentration reported [2] in the literature. Our patient did, however, experience intractable nausea and vomiting that abated markedly with temporary interruption of therapy and dose reduction.
This case demonstrates that in the rare event of multidrugresistant P. aeruginosa meningitis, the dosage of ciprofloxacin may be escalated safely beyond the maximum recommended dose in order to obtain adequate CSF concentrations relative to the drug's MIC for the organism.

Hypertrophy of the Breasts in a Patient Treated with Indinavir
Three-drug therapy that includes a protease inhibitor is now widely used to treat HIV-infected patients. Side effects of these drugs occur frequently [1 ­ 3], but rare or new adverse reactions may also occur. We observed moderate body shape alterations after initiation of therapy with protease inhibitors in a few male and female patients who were treated in our infectious diseases unit; these alterations included hypertrophy of the breasts and thinning of the buttocks and thighs. In these few cases, the alterations were not severe enough to discontinue treatment. We report the case of a 32-year-old women with a 10-year history of HIV infection who had to discontinue therapy with indinavir because of severe and painful breast hypertrophy.
The patient had been previously treated for Pneumocystis carinii infection in 1995 and cutaneous herpes. In 1996, genital

condylomas were treated locally with laser therapy and cryotherapy. She received two-drug therapy (didanosine plus zidovudine) from March 1995 to July 1996 and tolerated these drugs well. In July 1996, three-drug therapy with lamivudine, stavudine, and indinavir was started because of a decrease in her CD4 lymphocyte count (to 71/mm3) and an increase in the viral load (to 240,870 copies per mL; Amplicor, Roche Laboratories, Neuilly-sur-Seine). She also received co-trimoxazole as secondary prophylaxis but took no other medication.
In November 1996 the patient complained of swelling of her breasts. Her chest measurement had increased from 90 cm to 100 cm. The three-drug therapy was continued. At the end of December 1996, her chest measurement increased further to 105 cm; in addition, she had pain in her breasts and the local skin was red and edematous. Simultaneously, the patient's abdomen enlarged, although her body weight remained unchanged (70 kg). Thinning of the buttock and thighs was also observed. Her menstrual cycles were normal, her level of b human chorionic gonadotropin was normal, and her level of serum prolactin was normal (2.1 ng/mL by RIA [bioMe´rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France]; normal level is õ20 ng/mL). The patient was examined by a gynecologist and a mammogram was obtained, but no malignant or localized infectious process was detected.

Brief Reports

CID 1997;25 (October)

Indinavir was suspected to be the cause of our patient's breast swelling, and it was discontinued in January 1997. Treatment with lamivudine and stavudine was maintained. Our patient's breasts slowly decreased in size after therapy with the protease inhibitor was discontinued. In March 1997 our patient's chest measured 95 cm, and the skin on her breast appeared normal. Her abdomen, buttocks, and thighs partially returned to their initial shape.
According to Moore et al. [4] and Be´gaud et al. [5], the fact that the patient's breasts decreased in size after indinavir therapy was discontinued and the course of her symptoms suggest that indinavir was the cause of the breast hypertrophy. Indinavir was also suspected to cause moderate body shape alterations in other patients in our unit.
To our knowledge, hypertrophy of the breasts has not previously been described in a patient who was treated with indinavir. Body shape alterations, including hypertrophy of the breasts, in patients who are treated with protease inhibitors

should be reported to provide evidence for the imputability of treatment with respect to these phenomena and to further investigate their pathophysiology.
