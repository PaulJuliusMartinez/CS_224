ABSTRACT
This paper presents a new l i n g u i s t i c , computationally implemented model for morphological analysis and synthesis. It is general in the sense that the same l a n guage independent algorithm and the same computer program can operate on a wide range of languages, including highly i n f l e c t e d ones such as Finnish, Russian or Sanskrit. The new model is unrestricted in scope and it is capable of handling the whole language system as well as ordinary running text. A f u l l description for Finnish has been completed and tested, and the entries in the Dictionary of Modern Standard Finnish have been converted i n t o a format compatible with i t .
The model is based on a lexicon that defines the word roots, i n f l e c t i o n a l morphemes and certain nonphonological a l t e r nation p a t t e r n s , and on a set of p a r a l l e l rules that define phonologically oriented phenomena. The rules are implemented as p a r a l l e l f i n i t e state automata, and the same d e s c r i p t i o n can be run both in the producing and in the analyzing direction.
I INTRODUCTION
There have been few, if any, morphol o g i c a l parsers that would be t r u l y l a n guage independent or even applicable to a wide class of languages w i t h n o n t r i v i a l i n f l e c t i o n . The formalism of generative phonology is powerful enough to describe almost any language. Nevertheless, it has been very d i f f i c u l t to implement computat i o n a l l y . Martin Kay and Ron Kaplan (1981) have recently worked on a model where rules of generative phonology are compiled into f i n i t e automata, but u n t i l now their system has worked only in the producing mode for t e s t i n g the d e s c r i p t i o n s . The ultimate size of their t o t a l analyzing automaton is s t i l l unknown.
The t w o - l e v e l model has been developed in the course of a p r o j e c t on the computer analysis of Finnish, sponsored by the Academy of Finland and d i r e c t e d by professor Fred Karlsson. The new model is

an alternative to the formalism of generat i v e phonology, it has been inspired both by computational aspects and by those trends in l i n g u i s t i c s that s t r i v e for more concrete and psychologically r e a l phonol o g i c a l models. Even in the study of syntax there is a wide i n t e r e s t in simpler parsing mechanisms that would be more feasible as models of human language processing, e.g. Gazdar's context free grammars without transformations as well as some attempts going even further to f i n i t e state techniques (K. Church and E. Ejerhed 1982).
The t w o - l e v e l model d i f f e r s from generative phonology in that it proposes p a r a l l e l rules instead of successive ones. In t h i s way it avoids the existence of intermediate stages in the d e r i v a t i o n of single word forms. The name " t w o - l e v e l model" r e f l e c t s the setup, where only the l e x i c a l and the s u r f a c e l e v e l s ever "exist", there are no intermediate levels even l o g i c a l l y . The very problematic rule ordering is also avoided in the two-level model. The t w o - l e v e l model is a t t r a c t i v e as a process model, because it is based on f i n i t e state automata, which are the simp l e s t machinery possible. They can be r e a l i z e d w i t h many kinds of networks and devices.
I I T O E LEXICON
The lexicon contains j u s t one entry for each word even though the stem is subject to various alternations in the i n f l e c t i o n . This is accomplished by two mechanisms. F i r s t , morphophonemes may be used in the l e x i c a l representations w i t h corresponding rules that govern t h e i r r e a l i z a t i o n on the surface. In Finnish, there are several suppletive stem alternation patterns, which have their h i s t o r i c a l o r i g i n s , but which are synchronically active only as whole patterns, rather than as a result of any active individual independent r u l e s . As the second mechanism, the lexicon contains one alternation pattern for each such type, and t h i s is r e ferred to in the entries of the corresponding i n f l e c t i o n a l type. An example of

such an entry for a root would be:

(1) hevo nen/S "Horse";

Here the f i r s t item is the phonological representation of the stem, and the l a s t item is the information stored for the lexeme, in t h i s case the English translat i o n . The second item indicates what must come after t h i s entry. In this case, it is the name of an alternation pattern:

(2) nen/S

nen SO SE S123

Here too, the f i r s t items nen and sE are the phonological representations, (the c a p i t a l E is a morphophoneme, which is r e a l i z e d as n u l l before p l u r a l i ) . The second items (SO, S123) r e f e r to subsets of i n f l e c t i o n a l endings. The root entry together with t h i s pattern defines the various stems hevonen, hevosen, hevosia, etc. Such m i n i - l e x i c o n s have previously been used by Lauri Karttunen (1981) in his TEXFIN-system for analyzing Finnish word forms.

I l l THE RULES
The e s s e n t i a l c o n t r i b u t i o n of the two-level model is the concept of p a r a l l e l t w o - l e v e l r u l e s that r e l a t e the phonol o g i c a l representation defined by the d i c t i o n a r y and the surface form to each other. The rules do not rewrite or process forms, instead, each rule is l i k e an equat i o n t h a t a given surface form and a given lexical representation either satisfy or do not s a t i s f y . Rules are easiest to conceptualize if we assume both levels to be present. Let us take as an example Finnish p l u r a l i, which is realized as j if it occurs between vowels. The rule is formulated as:
(3) i <=> V + -- V j
Here the plus sign is a boundary s i g n a l between the stem and the i n f l e c t i o n a l endings. It is used e.g. for i n d i c a t i n g p l u r a l i:s and similar phenomena. The rule states t h a t i on the l e x i c a l l e v e l may only correspond to a j on surface if it is preceded by a vowel (on both l e v e l s ) and the boundary, and followed by a vowel. The r u l e also says t h a t t h i s is the only possible realization of i in this environment, and furthermore that t h i s is the only environment for t h i s correspondence. In analysis (resp. in production) a l l rules together act l i k e simultaneous equat i o n s . We know the surface (resp. the lexical) representation and find the other as a solution of the equations. I n f l e c t i o n a l morphology is quite complicated in

F i n n i s h , and the d e s c r i p t i o n contains about 50 rules.

IV RULES AS F I N I T E STATE AUTOMATA

Two-level rules correspond to and are implemented as f i n i t e state automata, where the input u n i t s are symbol p a i r s , one symbol from the l e x i c a l level and the other (or zero) from the surface l e v e l . The automaton corresponding to r u l e (3) is:

V + i i == V0 i j 0=
1: 2 1 2 0 1 1 2: 2 3 2 0 2 1 3: 2 1 4 5 3 1 4. 0 4 0 0 4 1 5. 2 5 2 0 5 0

The numbered rows stand for the states 1 colon and n o n f i n a l w i t h a p e r i o d . The column labels consist of character pairs. Zero symbolizes the n u l l ( i . e . absence of a c h a r a c t e r ) , V stands for any vowel and the equal sign for any character. Sets refer to pairs that are not more e x p l i c i t ly mentioned in another column in the same automaton. Thus the f i r s t column does not cover i:s corresponding to i:s or j : s , and the l a s t column does not cover vowels corresponding to vowels. State 1 is always the i n i t i a l s t a t e , and numbers in the table denote state t r a n s i t i o n s . A zero t r a n s i t i o n indicates a forbidden conf i g u r a t i o n . Below is a demonstration of the procession of the automaton in a configuration :

(5) Lexical: Surface: State:

t a 1 "o + i A ta1o0j a
11212352

The other a l t e r n a t i v e , t a l o i a , would have f a i l e d , because the t r a n s i t i o n on column 1 in state 4 is zero.

The rules (the automata) work together in p a r a l l e l l , a configuration is accepted if a l l rules (automata) pass. One c o n t r a d i c t i n g r u l e is enough to r u i n the correspondence. The columns with set symbols get t h e i r exact meaning only a f t e r a l l rules are given. The model presents a method for synchronizing the rules by c o l l e c t i n g a l l e x p l i c i t correspondences and a l i g n i n g the automata to operate coh e r e n t l y . The set of r u l e s (automata) act as a f i l t e r in the analysis, when matching e n t r i e s are sought from the l e x i c o n . In t h i s way nomographic word forms also get a l l grammatically correct interpretations.

The correspondence between the rulel i k e formalism and the automata is so close that a compiler is planned for translating rules into automata. However,

the automata are f a i r l y easy to w r i t e and understand as such, and the r u l e s in the f u l l description of Finnish inflection w e r e w r i t t e n d i r e c t l y a s a u t o m a t a . Some t w e n t y automata were needed and t h e i r manual c o m p i l a t i o n and t e s t i n g took only a few weeks.
Below are a few examples of t w o - l e v e l analyses of F i n n i s h word f o r m s . The f i r s t l i n e of each example is the word form to be analyzed, the second is the sequence of l e x i c a l e n t r i e s t h a t have been matched according to the r u l e s , and the t h i r d l i n e gives the information in the entries.

V COMPUTER IMPLEMENTATION The t w o - l e v e l program was w r i t t e n in standard Pascal programming language, i n i t i a l l y on a Burroughs B7800, but it runs now o n DEC-20 a s w e l l . I t c o u l d p r o b a b l y also be run on microcomputers for test purposes w i t h a s m a l l l e x i c o n . The program can a l t e r n a t e between producing word forms and a n a l y z i n g them. Production then s t a r t s from the morphophonological representat i o n s o f the l e x i c a l e n t r i e s and endings, and a v a l i d surface form (according to a l l rules) is generated. The 70 000 e n t r i e s in the D i c t i o n a r y of Modern Standard F i n n i s h have been transformed into the format of the twolevel description. By adding derivational r u l e s and e x c l u d i n g redundant and obsolete entries the whole active lexicon (about 15000 e n t r i e s ) could be s i m u l t a n e o u s l y used by the program. We have tested so f a r with sections of the lexicon at a time, e.g. e n t r i e s b e g i n n i n g w i t h k or r. The a n a l y s i s procedes w i t h a r e s t r i c t e d number of steps between each input character. With a large l e x i c o n it takes about 0.1

CPU s e c o n d s to a n a l y z e a r e a s o n a b l y c o m p l i c a t e d word form.
It is worth noting that the two-level algorithm provides a language independent framework for dealing w i t h word i n f l e c t i o n in s e v e r a l a p p l i c a t i o n s . E.g. in i n f o r m a t i o n r e t r i e v a l i t would p r o v i d e means f o r i m p r o v i n g the accuracy of the q u e r i e s and for reducing the size of inverted f i l e s , if the i n f l e c t e d word forms would be r e placed by t h e i r base forms. As a byproduct the algorithm also contributes to the general solution of spelling correction, by locating i n v a l i d word forms.
VI FUTURE We have plans for demonstrating the v a l i d i t y of the program and the model by creating descriptions for languages of o t h e r t y p e s , e.g. f o r some S l a v i c l a n guages and perhaps some O r i e n t a l l a n guages. As the next step in our p r o j e c t we s h a l l i n v e s t i g a t e more general syntactic models that could be applied to loose word order languages. In highly inflected languages l i k e F i n n i s h , complete morphologic a l a n a l y s i s i s much more i m p o r t a n t and i t covers a s i g n i f i c a n t p o r t i o n of what is treated as syntax in less inflected languages l i k e English.
