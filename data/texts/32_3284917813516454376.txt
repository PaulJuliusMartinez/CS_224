Background. Limitations of classification schemes for brain tumors based solely on morphology have stimulated searches for molecular markers of nosologic and prognostic value. Gangliosides are logical candidates because there are high concentrations of them in the nervous system, there is evidence of their roles in regulation of growth and differentiation, and data from small series suggest correlations between ganglioside composition and glioma type.
Methods. Ganglioside compositions were determined for 70 primary human brain tumors: 16 low grade astrocytomas (LG), 12 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 34 glioblastoma multiformes (GEM), and 8 primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). This method involved identification and quantitation of specific gangliosides using chemical analysis and immunoanalysis.
Results. Among all tumor types, histologic grade correlated with a progressive loss of 1b gangliosides (P < 0.0001). GQlb was higher in LGs than in AAs ( P < 0.001). Both GTlb and GDlb were higher in AAs than GBMs (P <0.01 and 0.05, respectively) and lower in PNETs than in GBMs ( P < 0.05). GM3 was higher in PNETs than in any astrocytoma group and higher in GBMs than in either AAs or LGs. There was a significant difference in the content of 3'-LM1 among all groups (P < 0.005), between

Limitations of light and electron microscopic study as

the sole basis for classifying and diagnosing primary tu-

mors of the central nervous system have stimulated a

search for other markers to expand the diagnosticarma-

mentarium. The number of such candidates is large, so

the choice of which ones to study on rather limited

amounts of material should be based on evidence that

they may be involved in clinically relevant tumor biol-

ogy. Gangliosides (Table 1) are sialic acid containing

glycosphingolipids that are present in all vertebrate

cells, but they are especially enriched in the central ner-

vous system.'-3 Experimental evidence indicates that

gangliosidesprobably are involved in mechanisms that

This is manifest in some types of tumors as the loss of

ganglioside composition of primary tumors of the human central nervous system is different from that of normal brain t i s s ~ e . ' ~H-o~w~ever, there has been no comprehensive study of gangliosides in a large number of these tumors in which data generated using sensitive assays for minor gangliosideshave been correlated with histologic diagnosis and grade. We report here the results of such a study on 70 tumors that demonstrate a
strong correlation between ganglioside compositions
and histologic types and grades of the major human brain tumors.
Materials and Methods
Human Glioma Specimens
Tumor tissue samples were received from members of the National Cancer Institute Cooperative Glioma Group (TheOhio State University, Barrow Neurological Institute and Mayo Clinic), and the National Cancer In-

stitute Cooperative Human Tissue Network. Shortly after each specimen was surgically removed, it was frozen in liquid nitrogen until chemical analysis. Seventy specimens, each weighing 300-1000 mg, from 66 patients were studied. For one patient, we had samples from both the original and recurrent specimens; another sample was a recurrent specimen for which we did not have tissue from the first operation. Three specimens were duplicate analyses on two separate portions of the same tumor. The specimens were from 38 male and 28
*female patients, giving a male-to-female ratio of 1.4.
For all patients the mean age was 34 23 years, with a median age of 37 years. Table 2 gives the gender and age distributions for each tumor type.
Representative hematoxylin and eosin stained slides from paraffin embedded tissues were examined by four neuropathologists from the three participating institutions. Tumors were dagnosed and graded using the criteria and system of the World Health Organizat i ~ nO.n~th~e basis of their independent examinations,

consensus diagnoses and grades were determined that were used in this study (Table 2). For statistical analyses, the 11 juvenile pilocytic and 5 Grade I1 fibrillary astrocytomas were combined into the category of low grade astrocytomas (LG). All anaplastic astrocytomas (AA) were judged to be Grade 111, and glioblastoma multiformes (GBM)and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET)were judged as Grade IV.

Extraction, Isolation, and Purification
Before tissues were extracted, a frozen section slide of each was prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and microscopically examined to ascertain that the tissue extracted consisted of tumor. Wet tumor tissue was weighed, lyophilized overnight, weighed again to determine dry weight, and rehydrated with 4 ml water per gram fresh weight for 1hour before homogenizing. Tissue was homogenized with an additional 16 ml (final, 20 ml) of chloroform-methanol (1:2) per gram fresh weight and centrifuged to pellet the nonlipid residues. The pellet was reextracted with chloroform-methanol-water (1:1:5%) and centrifuged again. The total lipid extract was dried and subjected to a Folch partit i ~ nT.he~lo~wer phase was washed an additional three times using theoretical upper phase without potassium chloride; all four upper phases were pooled. The pooled upper phase containing gangliosides was dried, dissolved in water, and adjusted to 0.1 M potassium chloride before passing through a Bakerbond SPE*C-18reverse phase column (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) to remove the salt. Results of neutral glycolipid analyses for these tumors have been reported elsewhere.34

Separation and Quantitation of Gangliosides

Total gangliosideswere quantitated on the basis of sialic

acid content using the colorimetric resorcinol-hydro-

chloric acid

Aliquots of 43 specimens con-

taining more than 40 p g sialic acid were separated on a

DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) column

eluting monosialogangliosideswith 0.02 M and 0.04 M

ammonium acetate in methanol, and polysialogangliosides with 0.25 M ammonium acetate.37r3B8 oth fractions were desalted by C-18 columns. Aliquots of 1.5 p g total ganglioside sialic acid were spotted on high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates (Kieselgel 60, E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and developed in chloroform-methanol-0.2% CaC12in water (55:45:10).The solvent system chloroform-methanol-5 M ammonium hydroxide-0.4% CaC12 (50:50:4:5) was used to separate N-acetyl- from N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid containing GM3 (ganglioside nomenclature is according to S ~ e n n e r h o l m ) .S~e~parated gangliosides were detected by resorcinolspray and densitometrically scanned in the reflection mode (Shimadzu CS-9000, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) at 580 nm. All specimens had these analyses performed on their total ganglioside extracts.
The same procedures were performed on the mono- and polysialoganglioside fractions isolated by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 chromatography of 43 tumors. There was no selection bias for the size of specimens with respect to diagnosis. Smaller specimens that were not subjected to DEAE-Sephadex chromatography were distributed as follows: 9 LG; 5 AA; 8 GBM; and 5 PNET. Chi-square analysis demonstrated that there was no statisticallysignificantdifferencein the distribution of these tumors among the diagnostic groups.
Identification of Specific Gangliosides by HPTLC Immunostaining
To confirm the identity of gangliotetraose series gangliosides (GM1, GDla, GDlb, GTlb, GQlb) on HPTLC, horseradish peroxidase conjugated Cholera toxin B subunit (List Biol Lab, Campbell, CA) was used with prior Closfridiurn perfringens type V (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) neuraminidase treatment4' on 11 representative specimens. N-glycolylneuraminic acid-containing GM3 was identified by immunostaining with antibody 2-39M from Kenneth Lloyd (Memorial Sloan-KetteringCancer Center, New York, NY). Neolacto- and lactotetraosylcontaining gangliosides were visualized by HPTLC im-

Immunostaining with F l H l l was performed on all 70 specimens, and immunostaining with TE3 was performed on 68 specimens.NS-24 antibody ( Y .Suzuki, University of Shizuoka, Japan) and MSG-15 (Dainabot) were used to confirm the identities of Y-LMl and 6'-LM1in nine tumors. GMlb was identifiedby positive immunostaining with anti-GAl polyclonal antibody (Waco, Richmond, VA) after neuraminidase treatment and negative immunostaining with Cholera toxin B detection in two of four tumors in which resorcinol staining disclosed a band with mobility slightly behind that of GM1 standards.
Data Analysis
Data from all of the 70 specimens were used in the presentation of summary statistics (Tables 3-6) and boxplots (Figs. 1-5). The data regarding ganglio series gangliosidesand linear combinations of their measured values were analyzed using analysis of variance models with pairwise significancestatements based on the least significant difference post hoc test. Thus, the P values reported for these pairwise comparisons are the corresponding experimentwise error rates. For each of these analyses, an examination of residual plots did not con-

tradict the validity of the methods used. The Fisher-Irwin exact test was used in the analysis of the minor gangliosides to examine the differencesbetween diagnostic groups in the presence or absence of the gangliosidebeing evaluated. All statistical studies of ratios involved an initial calculation of the ratios on a case-by-case basis; the calculated ratios were analyzed statistically.
Results
Total Gangliosides
Total gangliosidesialicacid concentration per milligram dry weight was lower in all tumors than in normal brain tissue (Table 4).43The group of PNET had the lowest concentration of all tumor groups, but there was no significant difference among grades of astrocytictumors.
Ganglio Series Gangliosides
The amounts and proportions of ganglio series gangliosides in different human brain tumor diagnostic groups and normal brain are shown in Tables 3 and 4. These values were obtained by scanning densitometry of thin layer chromatographic plates sprayed with resorcinol (Fig. 6). Identification of gangliotetraose gangliosides was confirmed in 11 representative tumors using the neuraminidase/Cholera toxin method (Fig. 7). Oligosaccharide complexity was estimated by a sugar index calculated by the formula: sugar index = sum of [(proportion of ganglioside species) X (number of sugars per
molecule^)].^^ This index was higher for LG than for
GBM (P < 0.01), with AA intermediate between these two. PNET was significantly lower than all of the astrocytoma groups (P < 0.01).The degree of sialylationwas

Neolactotetraosyl gangliosides of uncertain identities were seen in some tumors. In the polysialoganglioside fractions of 25 tumors there were bands that stained positively with F l H l l in the region between GDla and GDlb (21.9 k 6.8 pmol/mg dry weight). This could account for 10-20% of the amount attributed to GD2 on the basis of resorcinol detection in these tumors. Such gangliosidescomigratingwith GDlb were present in five tumors (all smaller than 8 pmol/mg dry weight); another migrated between GDlb and GTlb in one tumor (5 pmol/mg dry weight). In three tumors there were FlHl1 positive gangliosides that migrated with GTlb (all smaller than 4 pmol/mg dry weight).

F l H l l positive bands were seen between GD3 and GDla in 17 tumors (11.4 f 6.1 pmol/mg dry weight); some of these eluted in the mono- and some in the polysialogangliosidefractions. There was no significantcorrelation between any of these gangliosides and histologic diagnosis.

Ganglioside 3'isoLMl was identified by its presence in the monosialoganglioside fraction, TLC mobility, and immunopositivity with TE3 after neuraminidase treatment. It was present in 7 of 16 (43%) LG, 2 of 11 (18%) AA, 17 of 31 (55%) GBM, and 0 of 7 (0%) PNET. The presence/ absence of 3'-koLM1 was not statistically significantly different between any two diagnostic categories.
A ganglioside was seen in the polysialoganglioside fraction, which migrated between GDla and GD2 standards on HPTLC and stained positively with TE3 after neuraminidase treatment, which could be either or both of 3',6'-isoLD1 or 3',8'-isoLDl. It was present in LG (43%) and GBM (36%) but not in AA or PNET. Only five tumors (three ordinary LG, one pilocytic, and 1 GBM) contained a ganglioside with similar characteristics, except that it migrated in the GTlb area. This is assumed to represent an isoLTl .

GM3, GD3, and GD2
The proportions of GM3 and GD3 were elevated in all of the brain tumors relative to normal adult white or gray matter. The proportion of GM3 was higher in PNET than in any of the astrocytic tumors (P < 0.001) and was slightly higher in GBM than in AA or LG (Fig. 5). The proportion of GD3 did not correlate with the histologic grade or diagnosis. Thus, the ratio of GM3 to GD3 correlated with the histologic grade of malignancy overall. Correlating results of resorcinol stained with immunostained TLC plates indicates that GD2 overlaps with lacto and neolactopolysialogangliosides. More precise estimates of GD2 require additional study.

Discussion

Accurate classification of brain tumors is necessary to

direct appropriate therapy and for proper interpretation

of clinical investigations. However, classification based

solely on histologic features often is inadequate for pre-

dictingtumor behavior and outcome. Severalof the his-

tologic criteria used to classify and grade brain tumors

are somewhat subjective, resulting in significant inter-

and intraobserver variability in diagnosis. In addition,

subpopulations of tumor cells with similar histologic

appearances but different biologic behaviors cannot be

distinguished. Finally, there is heterogeneity in tumor

response to treatment. Clinical responses to therapy

and survival vary, even among patients with the same

histologic type and grade of tumor. Improved classifi-

cation of brain tumors requires identification of objec-

tive markers that correlate with histologic features; are

predictiveof biologic behavior, clinicalprogression, and

response to therapy; and are relatively simple to assay.

Current molecular probes fail to completely address

these problems, in part because of a paucity of markers

for specific cell types in the mature and developing ner-

vous system.

A number of markers for different types of brain

tumors have been reported. Cytogenetic abnormalities

in chromosomes 7, 10, 17, as well as DNA aneuploidy

as determined by flow cytometry have been reported to

be significant in human gliomas. Several quantitative

methods for measuring cellular proliferation also have

been studied in gliomas. These include Ki-67 antibody

labeling of proliferating pool cells, bromodeoxyurine

incorporation into S-phase cells, and silver staining of

nucleolar organizing

Unfortunately, these

markers have not been reliable in distinguishing be-

tween AA and GBM. Abnormal expression of growth

factors or growth factor receptors has been found in hu-

man astrocytic tumors, such as amplification of the c-

erb B gene (epidermal growth factor receptor gene) and

the c-sis oncogene, which codes for PDGF-/3.47How-

ever, these have not been shown to be of sufficient value relative to tumor type to be applied diagnostically.
Aberrant glycosylation of lipid in tumors has been reported for several tumor types.49More specifically, abnormal gangliosideexpression in human gliomas has been found in several studies.29-31,50Y~a5t1es et aL3"reported a small series in which human neural tumors had larger proportions of simple gangliosides and smaller proportions of complex gangliosides when compared with normal brain tissue. Fredman et al.,51in a study of human gliomas, also found a general reduction in the ganglio series gangliosides normally present in adult human brain (GM1, GDla, GDlb, and GTlb). In addition, Berra et aL3' demonstrated a correlationbetween the loss of polysialylated gangliosides and histologic grade of malignancy in 38 human astrocytomas.
Our study is based on a larger sample size than is any previously reported series, and the statistical analyses of the results are more detailed. Although there was no correlation between total gangliosideand histologic type, we found that the degrees of oligosaccharide complexity and sialylation correlate significantly with the histologic grade of malignancy. These changes were attributable primarily to the loss of total l b gangliosides (GDlb, GTlb, GQlb). However, the correlation between total l b ganglioside content and histologic grade of malignancy is almost certainly not attributable to contamination of tumor samples by residual brain tissue for three reasons.
First, GM1 and GDla, also ganglio series gangliosides in normal human brain, did not demonstrate the same pattern of change. Second, the mean amount of neutral galactolipid in these tumors (mainly cerebroside, which is highly enriched in myelin) was only 9% of white matter values. In addition, the total lipid in tumors averaged only 3.6% of the fresh weight, which is only one-fourth its level in white matter and even less than that of gray matter (5.9%).The results of neutral glycolipid analyses of these tumors have been previously published.34A third argument against contamination of the specimens with normal brain is the differential and progressive loss of l b gangliosides with increasingtumor grade. The decrease in GQlb is seen first between LG and AA. The decrease in GTlb and GDlb occursbetween AA and the Grade IV tumors (GBM and PNET). In contrast, all gangliosides from normal brain should decrease simultaneously as they are diluted by expanding tumor (of any grade) and not change differentially and sequentially with increasing histologic grade as we found (Table 4 and 5). In addition, the histologic appearances of these tumors provide no reason to believe that low grade tumors should have more contaminating normal brain than should high grade tumors.

Figure 10. Ganglioside biosynthetic pathway. In normal adult brain, GM1, GDla, GDlb, and GTlb are the major gangliosides, and none of the neoIacto or lacto series gangliosides are detectable.

We conclude that in astrocytic tumors, increasing degrees of histologic malignancy are correlated with a progressive decrease in 1b gangliosidesand an increase in the neolacto series gangliosides, mainly 3'-LM1 (Fig. 10).This indicates that, as tumors progress in degree of malignancy, there is a concurrent change in ganglioside metabolism, resulting in a switch from the l b pathway to the neolactogangliosidepathway. Another possibility is that there are changes in the proportions of different subpopulations of tumors cells that have different ganglioside compositions.However, these two possible bases for differences in ganglioside composition among different tumor types are not mutually exclusive. In either case, it is possible that patients with brain tumors containing larger amounts of gangliosides of the neolacto family may have poorer survival. Evidence for or against this requires a detailed survival analysis.
Neolacto and lacto series gangliosides both are derived from LA2, which contains GlcNAc, not GalNAc. Neolactotetraosylgangliosides, e.g., 3'-LM1, are different from lactotetraosylgangliosides, e.g., 3'isoLM1, in that the former, unlike the latter, contains
- -a terminal Ga1,l 4GlcNAc, rather than Ga1,l
3GlcNAc. As these tumors became progressively more malignant, the relative activities of glycosyltransferases responsible for synthesizing the neolacto family of gangliosides may be correlates, or even determinants, of biologic behavior.
Our results are of potential value in classification, diagnosis, and in determining the prognosis of human brain tumors. Several gangliosides in this study may be potential markers for classificationand grading of these tumors. For example, the amount of GQlb is considerably less in LG than in AA. In addition, pilocytic astrocytomas clearly separated from ordinary LG on the basis of both Y-LMl and 3'-isoLM1. The amounts of GTlb

and GDlb are significantly lower, and 3'-LM1 higher, in GBM than in AA. These same l b pathway gangliosides are even lower and 3'-LM1 higher in PNET than in GBM. The proportions of GM3 and 3'-LM1 were higher in PNET than in any of the astrocytic tumor groups studied, and PNET had extremely low levels of GM1. In contrast, very high levels of GMl were present in AA.
Ariga and Yu45identified GMlb as a minor ganglioside (2.6 pg/g fresh weight) in normal human brain. The two glioblastomas containing high levels of GMlb in our study had no or little neolactogangliosides, a finding that suggests that a portion of the ganglioside biosynthetic pathway in these glioblastomasis diverted toward GMlb synthesis, rather than toward the neolacto-ganglioside pathway (Fig. 10). The biologic significance of GMlb is unclear. However, the patient whose tumor had elevated GMlb is alivemore than 701 days after surgery; the other patient died within 24 hours of surgery, with death not being attributable to rapid regrowth.
Gangliosides are associated with regulation of cell g r o ~ t h a~n-d~cell a d h e ~ i o n .S~pe~c,if~ic~gangliosides inhibit PDGF-stimulated DNA ~ y n t h e s i s , ' ~c,h~an~ges in intracellular free ~alcium,~re' ceptor tyrosine phosp h ~ r y l a t i o n , ' ~an, ~d~receptor dimeri~ation.T'~he most inhibitory gangliosides of PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, receptor dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation, are GTlb and GDlb, the same gangliosides that are deficient in the more malignant tumors in the current study. However, the least inhibitory ganglioside, GM3, is markedly elevated in high grade tumors, a finding that strongly suggests that a loss of structurally more complex gangliosides may be mechanistically related to the loss of growth control in these tumors. Supporting this notion are the findings of Zheng et a1.,68 who found that GM3 plays an important role in supporting integrin receptor function in fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion, and of Kleinman et al.,71who reported that polysialogangliosides inhibited cell adhesion to fibronectin. Both of these studies suggest that changes in ganglioside composition may be involved in tumor invasion. Thus, there is mounting evidence to indicate that gangliosidesplay a role in the biology of human gliomas. With monoclonal antibodies specific to glycolipids becoming more available, it may be possible to identify clinically significant subpopulations of tumor cells based on their glycolipid contents. Thus, the glycolipid profile might facilitate the classification and diagnosis of primary human brain tumors.
