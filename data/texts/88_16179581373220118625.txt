Since autocrine regulation of HGF-Met is implicated in many forms of human cancer, we investigated whether the predisposition to develop ovarian cancer in women with hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes involves changes in the expression of HGF-Met by the tissue of origin of epithelial ovarian cancers, the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). We compared cultures of normal OSE from women with (FH-OSE) (n=20) and with no (NFH-OSE) (n=48) family histories of ovarian cancer, SV40 Tag immortalized OSE lines (IOSE, n=5) and ovarian cancer cell lines (n=3). Cultures derived from 21/22 women with NFH-OSE and 13/13 women with FH-OSE expressed Met mRNA initially. After two to three passages, Met was downregulated in 37% of NFHOSE cultures but persisted in 100% of FH-OSE cultures and ovarian cancer lines, like other epithelial dierentiation markers that are stabilized in FH-OSE and neoplasia. HGF and Met mRNA were concomitantly expressed by NFH-OSE from only three of 32 women but in FH-OSE from eight of 13 women, and also in ®ve of ®ve IOSE and two of three ovarian cancer lines. Conditioned media from FH-OSE, but not NFH-OSE, contained immunoreactive HGF and induced cohort migration which was inhibited by neutralizing HGF antibody. Several signaling molecules of the PI3K pathway, including Akt2 and p70 S6K, were constitutively activated in FH-OSE from six of six women but in NFH-OSE from only four of eight women. Exogenous HGF was mitogenic in OSE, and that eect was regulated through the MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2) and FRAP/p70 S6K pathways. The proliferative response to HGF was greater in NFH-OSE than in FH-OSE cultures. The results show that FH-OSE cultures dier from NFH-OSE by increased stability of Met expression and by HGF secretion. Constitutive phosphorylation of kinases and a diminished growth response to HGF suggest the presence of autocrine regulation in FH-OSE. In analogy with other cell types where an autocrine HGF-Met loop has been implicated in tumorigenic

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of death from gynecologic malignancies among North American women. Familial ovarian cancer accounts for 5 ± 10% of all ovarian carcinomas. The most thoroughly studied germline mutations underlying a greatly increased susceptibility to ovarian and breast cancer are those in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (Aunoble et al., 2000). In spite of its clinical importance, the molecular and cellular basis of this neoplasm remains an enigma. Epithelial ovarian cancers arise de novo from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), which is the pelvic mesothelium covering the ovary and lining the epithelial inclusion cysts (Scully, 1995; Ong et al., 2000). In contrast to carcinomas arising from most other epithelia that lose dierentiation characteristics with neoplastic progression, OSE-derived carcinomas usually express more complex epithelial characteristics than those of normal OSE, as the tumors acquire morphological and functional properties of the highly specialized epithelia of Mullerian duct origin, viz the oviduct, endometrium and endocervix. These properties include the assumption of columnar cell shapes, formation of papillae and glandular structures and expression of high molecular weight keratins, CA125, E-cadherin and mucin (Auersperg et al., 1998). Normal OSE exhibits a dual epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype: it coexpresses keratin and vimentin, and, in culture, produces not only epithelial (laminin, collagen IV) but also mesenchymal (collagen I and III) components of extracellular matrix (Auersperg et al., 1994). We reported previously that evidence of the Mullerian phenotype is already observed in overtly normal OSE from women with family histories of breast/ovarian cancer (FH-OSE). These epithelia have a higher and

more stable expression of epithelial dierentiation markers including morphology, keratin, CA125 and E-cadherin, as compared to OSE from women with no such family histories (NFH-OSE) (Auersperg et al., 1995; Dyck et al., 1996; Wong et al., 1999). E-cadherin protein, in particular, is absent in NFH-OSE but appears in FH-OSE and metaplastic OSE in vivo and in vitro. While E-cadherin mRNA is downregulated in short-term cultures of NFH-OSE, its expression persists to senescence in cultures of FH-OSE and ovarian cancer cells (Wong et al., 1999). Therefore, an increased expression and autonomy of epithelial characteristics may be among the earliest steps of epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis.
In the present study, we examined the in¯uence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor Met in the regulation of OSE physiology, and we investigated possible phenotypic manifestations of the genetic changes underlying hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes in terms of HGF-Met expression and action. HGF, identical to scatter factor (SF), is produced primarily by mesenchymal and stromal cells, and acts on epithelial cells through its receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-met protooncogene by a paracrine mechanism (Bottaro et al., 1991; Di Renzo et al., 1991). HGF is an essential regulator of cell growth and motility and, importantly for this study, it has the capacity to induce epithelial morphogenesis, including branching and tubule formation in culture (Montesano et al., 1991; Tsarfaty et al., 1992, 1994; Brinkmann et al., 1995). Inappropriate expression of HGF-Met induces the formation of cystic structures with enhanced epithelial dierentiation which mimic preneoplastic ovarian lesions (Tsarfaty et al., 1992, 1994). During mouse development, HGF is produced by the mesenchyme at the urogenital region in the vicinity of Met-expressing epithelia, indicating that the development and morphogenesis of urogenital organs, including ovary, depend on a paracrine regulation by HGFMet (Sonnenberg et al., 1993). We and others have shown that, in the adult, the expression of Met persists in the OSE and in the Mullerian duct-derived epithelia and that its level of expression is increased in ovarian carcinomas (Parrott et al., 1994; Di Renzo et al., 1994; Moghul et al., 1994; Huntsman et al., 1999). However, unlike in some other human cancers, overexpression of Met in ovarian cancer is not associated with ampli®cation of the c-met gene (Di Renzo et al., 1994). Constitutive activation of Met receptor through paracrine/autocrine mechanisms has been shown to play an important role in cell transformation and tumorigenicity (Vande Woude et al., 1997; To and Tsao, 1998; Jiang et al., 1999). Recombinant HGF has been demonstrated to stimulate proliferation and motility in ovarian cancer cells, and these properties may contribute to the peritoneal dissemination in late stages of ovarian tumor progression (Corps et al., 1997). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that HGF/Met may also play a role in early stages of ovarian carcinogenesis by in¯uencing the growth of preneoplastic OSE and/or by contributing to the

Results
Cells from a total of 20 women with family histories (FH-OSE) (Table 1) and 48 women without family histories (NFH-OSE) of ovarian cancer were examined in this study. Because the number of cells obtainable from freshly explanted OSE is small and their lifespan in culture is limited, the variables examined in this study could not all be tested for each case. Furthermore, each primary culture was passaged into several culture dishes, so that the number of cultures exceeds the number of cases.
Expression of Met receptor and HGF in OSE
Immunoreactive Met protein was detected in 9/11 (81%) NFH-OSE cultures and in 4/4 (100%) FH-OSE cultures. Representative samples are shown in the upper panel of Figure 1A. All Met positive NFHOSE cultures had an epithelial phenotype and were in primary cultures (p.0) or at low passages (p.1 ± 2), while two NFH-OSE cultures that were Met negative had a mesenchymal (®broblast-like) phenotype and were in a late passage (p.4 ± 5) (Figure 1A, lane 4). While Met protein was downregulated in most NFHOSE cultures, the protein persisted to senescence in all FH-OSE cultures (Figure 1C). Met protein was also highly expressed in all three (100%) ovarian cancer cell lines. Unlike E-cadherin that seems to be regulated post-transcriptionally in some cases (Wong et al., 1999), Met protein was consistently detected along with its transcript in normal and neoplastic OSE

(Figure 1A,B). By RT ± PCR, Met mRNA were detected in 26/27 (96%) of the NFH-OSE cultures in p.0 ± 2, but only in 13/20 (65%) of NFH-OSE cultures in p.3 ± 5 (Figure 1B,C). Consistent with our results of Western blot analysis, Met mRNA persisted to senescence in all 14 (100%) FH-OSE cultures, and in all three (100%) ovarian carcinoma lines (Figure 1B,C). This dierence in the expression of Met in prolonged cultures of FH-OSE and ovarian cancer cells as compared to NFH-OSE is statistically signi®cant (P50.05). Met was also present in 3/3 SV40 Tagimmortalized NFH-OSE lines and 2/2 SV40 Tag immortalized FH-OSE lines.
Transcripts of HGF were found in 10/23 (43%) FHOSE cultures derived from eight of 13 women, in 5/5 of the SV40 Tag-immortalized lines mentioned above and in 2/3 (67%) ovarian carcinoma lines, but only in 3/34 (9%) NFH-OSE cultures derived from 3/24 women (Figure 2). To quantify the level of HGF expression in these cells, we performed ELISA on conditioned media. HGF was measured in samples of eight NFHOSE, 5 FH-OSE and two ovarian cancer cell lines. Both positive and negative results by RT ± PCR were consistent with the results of HGF ELISA. The median HGF level was 46 pg/ml (range 32 ± 139 pg/ml) in FHOSE cultures, and HGF was expressed at a higher level in the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 (310 pg/ml)

than in OVCAR-3 (43 pg/ml) (Table 2). HGF concentrations secreted by the positive control line WI-38 were higher by one order of magnitude or more. In contrast, HGF protein was not detected in NFHOSE cultures despite our eorts at concentrating their conditioned media.
We also compared the capacity to induce scatter activity (cell dissociation) (Stoker and Perryman, 1985) by the conditioned media. Media conditioned by FHOSE, IOSE and ovarian cancer cells induced cohort migration (Nabeshima et al., 1998) of C-4II colonies, i.e. a limited form of cell dissociation which results in irregularities of the contours of cohesive epithelial colonies. The conditioned medium of the positive

control cell line WI-38, which produces high levels of HGF (Table 2), caused intense cell dispersion and scattering. These dierent eects corresponded to those elicited by low and high concentrations of exogenously added HGF respectively (Figure 3). The identi®cation of HGF in the conditioned media of FH-OSE and ovarian cancer cells as the scatter-inducing factor was con®rmed by the inhibition of scattering by neutralizing anti-HGF antibody (Figure 3). A reduction in the number of irregular, pointed C-4II colonies concomitant with an increase in the number of round colonies was demonstrated in conditioned media from both low passage and SV40-immortalized FH-OSE cultures and ovarian cancer cell lines, but not from NFH-OSE or control medium, when neutralized with anti-HGF antibody (Figures 3 and 4). One FH-OSE culture, OSE-153F, which lacks HGF mRNA, showed little or no change. The cohort migration induced by the low amounts of HGF produced by these cells was at the limit of detection with the assay used which made quanti®cation less precise, and the number of cultures

HGF in human ovarian surface epithelium AST Wong et al
tested was small because of the limitations of low passage FH-OSE cultures available. In spite of these limitations, the results suggest strongly that at least part of the changes in C-4II culture morphology was the result of bioactive HGF secreted by FH-OSE, IOSE and ovarian cancer cells.

Protein kinase regulation in OSE
Eight NFH-OSE cultures from eight women and six FH-OSE cultures from six women were examined for protein kinase activities in the presence of HGF stimulation. As shown in Figure 5, HGF stimulation resulted in phosphorylation of Erk 2 and Erk 1 (a), Akt1 (b), Akt2 (c) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K) (d) in normal and malignant OSE. Such phosphorylation of these kinases, as revealed by their reduced mobilities on SDS ± PAGE gels, is consistent with their activation (Huleman et al., 1999; Parrott and Templeton, 1999). Interestingly, in all (100%) FH-OSE cultures and the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3, the downstream

Figure 4 Scattering and cohort migration assays were performed as described in Materials and methods. Conditioned media from NFH-OSE and FH-OSE (concentrated 10 ± 15-fold), SV40immortalized FH-OSE (concentrated 15-fold) and ovarian cancer cell lines (concentrated 15-fold) were concentrated using Biomax30. Concentrated conditioned medium with (&) or without (&) polyclonal rabbit anti-HGF antibody (5 mg/ml) was added to C4II colonies. After a 24 h incubation, 61-250 colonies per culture in 24-well plates were counted and their shapes classi®ed as round (no eect), irregular (cohort migration) or dissociated into single cells (scattering). The latter two responses re¯ect weak and strong HGF eects, respectively (see Figure 3). Case numbers ending in `F' are derived from women with strong family histories of ovarian/breast cancer. Cases I-261F and I-267F were previously immortalized with SV40 Tag. Medium refers to concentrated fresh culture medium. The variation in amplitudes of the responses to media from dierent cases is in¯uenced by slight variations in the growth patterns of the C-4II cells between experiments

Figure 5 Eects of HGF stimulation on protein kinase activation assessed by phosphorylation-induced reductions of kinase mobilities on Western blots. Treatment with 20 ng/ml HGF resulted in the phosphorylation and apparent activation of the (a) p42 and p44 MAP kinases (Erk 2 and Erk 1), (b) Akt1, (c) Akt2, and (d) p70 S6K in NFH-OSE, FH-OSE and OVCAR-3. Note that phosphorylated forms of (c) Akt2, and (d) p70 S6K are present in FH-OSE and OVCAR-3 even in the absence of HGF stimulation. Phosphorylated Erk2 co-migrates with dephosphorylated Erk1 on these gels

eectors of PI3K, including Akt2 and p70 S6K, were phosphorylated even in the absence of HGF stimulation. This is in contrast to NFH-OSE, where less than 50% of the cultures expressed constitutively active Akt2 and p70 S6K (Figure 5). Other PI3K downstream regulators such as GSK3b and ILK were also studied. The antibodies used against these kinases did not selectively recognize phosphorylated forms of GSK3b and ILK; therefore, their activities remain to be determined. There was no dierence in their expression between NFH-OSE and FH-OSE cultures before and after HGF stimulation (data not shown).
HGF stimulates OSE cell proliferation
To examine the mitogenic eect of HGF on OSE, cells were cultured with or without HGF stimulation and cell numbers were determined by the Methylene Blue assay (Elliott and Auersperg, 1993). Among Metexpressing cultures, all 10 early-passage NFH-OSE cultures (p.1 ± 3) and all eight FH-OSE cultures (p.1 ± 3) demonstrated statistically signi®cant increases in cell growth in the presence of recombinant HGF (P50.05) (Figure 6). However, the proliferative response was more consistently limited in the HGF-stimulated FHOSE cultures than NFH-OSE cultures (P50.05) (Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the dose-response eect of HGF for one NFH-OSE and one FH-OSE culture

Figure 6 Eect of HGF on cell proliferation of NFH-OSE (~) and FH-OSE (~). Each symbol represents an individual case. Cell numbers were determined colorimetrically by the Methylene Blue assay as described in Materials and methods. Data are presented as fold increase in cell number of HGF-stimulated (20 ng/ml) cultures of the control (0 ng/ml HGF)
with comparable responses to 20 ng/ml HGF as shown in Figure 6. The optimal concentration of HGF for OSE cell proliferation was 10 ± 20 ng/ml (Figure 7). Those late-passage NFH-OSE cultures (p.4 ± 7) that did not express Met receptor had no growth response to HGF (data not shown). The amounts of HGF secreted by FH-OSE (0.03 ± 0.14 ng/ml) (Table 2) are below the limit of HGF concentrations which result in proliferative responses of normal OSE (1.0 ng/ml). In accordance with this limit, addition of polyclonal rabbit anti-HGF antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapols, MN, USA) at 5.0 mg/ml medium over 6 ± 8 days did not alter the growth rate of either FH-OSE or NFHOSE cells (data not shown). Therefore, the dierence between NFH-OSE and FH-OSE shown in Figure 6

might re¯ect downregulation of Met by endogenous HGF.
By blocking MEK 1 and 2 with PD98059 (50 mM) or inhibiting mTOR/FRAP with rapamycin (20 nM), HGF-activated OSE cell proliferation was abolished (P50.05) (Figure 8). All OSE cultures were most sensitive to the growth inhibitory eects of LY294002 (25 mM) (P50.05), indicating that the PI3K signaling pathway is important in OSE cell growth and survival. LY294002 also signi®cantly inhibited serum-induced OSE cell proliferation. Inactivation of p38 MAPK by SB203580 (10 mm) had no eect on HGF-stimulated OSE cell growth (P40.05) (Figure 8). The HGFinduced OSE proliferative response was neutralized by the use of anti-HGF antibody (P50.05) (Figure 8).

Motogenic and morphogenetic effects of HGF in OSE
Both NFH-OSE and FH-OSE formed con¯uent monolayers of epithelial cells in primary cultures (Figure 9). To investigate the possible role of HGF as a motogen, con¯uent cultures were wounded with a scraper and the eect of 20 ng/ml HGF was examined. There was no observable eect on either cell motility or morphology (data not shown). It is dicult to know whether sparse FH-OSE cultures exhibited spontaneous scattering suggestive of autocrine regulation by HGF, because of the variability in growth patterns among noncon¯uent cultures. The lack of response to exogenous HGF makes such a mechanism unlikely.
Three NFH-OSE cases and four FH-OSE cases were analysed for morphogenesis in collagen gels. OSE cells did not proliferate, but dispersed and assumed a spindle-shaped morphology within collagen gels independently of HGF (data not shown). Such a dispersed phenotype is unlikely to exhibit morphogenesis (Kruk et al., 1994). There was no dierence in morphological appearance and cell numbers between NFH-OSE and FH-OSE cultures with or without HGF.

Discussion
Inappropriate expression of HGF and Met has been implicated in a variety of human cancers, including ovarian cancer (Di Renzo et al., 1994; Moghul et al., 1994; Huntsman et al., 1999; Sowter et al., 1999). In the present study, we have shown dierential regulation of HGF and its receptor Met in overtly normal human OSE from women with (FH-OSE) and with no (NFH-OSE) family histories of ovarian cancer.

data demonstrate that the Met receptor is present in short-term cultures and downregulated in prolonged cultures of NFH-OSE, but is stabilized in FH-OSE cultures at all passages, similar to ovarian carcinoma lines. Therefore, some of the factors that alter Met levels in the malignant progression of ovarian surface epithelial tumors (Di Renzo et al., 1994; Moghul et al., 1994; Huntsman et al., 1999) may already be found in FH-OSE. The phenotypic manifestation of FH-OSE in expressing Met is in keeping with the increased stability of other epithelial dierentiation characteristics in women with hereditary ovarian cancer syndromes (Auersperg et al., 1995; Dyck et al., 1996; Wong et al., 1999). We also show here, for the ®rst time, the coexpression of HGF and Met in most cases of FHOSE, in IOSE and ovarian cancer cells, but only rarely in NFH-OSE.
Media conditioned by FH-OSE, but not by NFHOSE, induced cohort migration of cervical carcinoma colonies in the absence of exogenous HGF. Cohort migration, i.e. partial disruption of intercellular junctions and enhanced migration of cohesive epithelial cell sheets, results in increased irregularities of epithelial colony outlines, in contrast to complete disruption of cell ± cell junctions which re¯ects classical `scattering' (Nabeshima et al., 1998). Our data demonstrate that epithelial cell colonies may exhibit cohort migration or scattering depending on exposure to low or high concentrations of HGF respectively. In contrast to the eect of concentrated FH-OSE conditioned media on the cervical carcinoma colonies, which was reversed by anti-HGF antibody, treatment of FH-OSE cultures with anti-HGF antibody did not provide evidence for autocrine HGF-mediated growth stimulation, although these cells responded to mitogenic stimulation by exogenous HGF. This result would be expected, since the small amounts of HGF secreted by FH-OSE (0.03 ± 0.14 ng/ml) were below the limit of HGF concentrations which cause a proliferative response in normal OSE and most other epithelial cells (Sato and Takahashi, 1997; Balkovetz, 1999). In contrast, the conditioned media which caused cohort migration of the cervical carcinoma colonies were concentrated 10 ± 15-fold. It should also be kept in mind that, in vivo, pericellular HGF concentrations

might achieve much higher levels within intact tissues due to greater constrains of diusion.
The cohort migration response to the conditioned media in our study is in keeping with the possible presence of a functional autocrine regulatory system in the FH-OSE cells, but not the NFH-OSE cells, and suggests that a similar system might exist in vivo. Therefore, while the expression of Met by OSE is in keeping with the presence of this receptor in most epithelia, the presence of HGF may represent a very early or predisposing step in ovarian surface epithelial neoplastic transformation. It is important to note that some of the dierences between the FH-OSE and NFH-OSE cultures were not absolute but, rather, appeared as trends. For example, some FH-OSE cultures did not express HGF, and growth responses (Figure 6) and kinase activation (Figure 5) overlapped between the two groups of cultures. Such overlap re¯ects the heterogeneity of the surgical specimens on which this study is based and points to other, unde®ned in¯uences in some of the cases.
RT ± PCR demonstrated that Met transcript was always detected in parallel with that of E-cadherin, which also becomes upregulated and stabilized in ovarian carcinomas and, to a lesser degree, in FHOSE. However, unlike E-cadherin that seems to be regulated post-transcriptionally in some cases (Wong et al., 1999), Met mRNA was consistently detected along with its protein in normal and neoplastic OSE. Normal mesothelial cells, which share a common embryological origin and anatomical environment with OSE, lack HGF and Met (Klominek et al., 1998). This suggests that expression of Met receptor might be a feature characteristic of coelomic epithelium derivatives at the urogenital ridge through local dierentiation.
Exogenous HGF stimulates proliferation and motility in ovarian cancer cells, and these properties may contribute to the peritoneal dissemination during ovarian tumor progression (Corps et al., 1997). In vivo, HGF is found at high levels in malignant ovarian cystic and ascitic ¯uid from women with ovarian carcinomas compared to peritoneal ¯uid of normal women (Sowter et al., 1999). These high levels may be primarily derived from stromal cells and cells of the immune system which are the normal sources of this factor. However, our results indicate that FH-OSE, IOSE and ovarian cancer cell cultures also synthesize small amounts of bioactive HGF. It has been shown that extracellular processing by proteases in response to tissue damage and tumor progression is required to activate the HGF precursor, pro-HGF (Miyazawa et al., 1996; Jiang et al., 1999). In our study, the HGF ELISA measures both HGF and pro-HGF; therefore, in addition to the low HGF levels achieved in culture, the limited scatter capability and lack of mitogenic activity by media conditioned by FH-OSE, IOSE and the cancer lines may have been in¯uenced by the presence of an inactive precursor form of HGF which requires in vivo factors for activation. Although the responses varied, the overall proliferative response of HGF-stimulated FH-OSE cultures was more limited

than that of NFH-OSE cultures. This dierence between NFH-OSE and FH-OSE might re¯ect downregulation of Met by cell-derived HGF.
HGF is a pleiotropic factor that evokes complex biological responses. Accordingly, its receptor tyrosine kinase Met activates various signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we showed that HGF activated multiple signaling molecules of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in both normal and malignant OSE, using mobility shift assays (Parrot and Templeton, 1999; Hulleman et al., 1999). Akt2 and p70 S6K, which are downstream eectors of PI3K, were constitutively phosphorylated in ovarian cancer cell lines. Importantly, such phosphorylation was also found in the absence of HGF in all FH-OSE cultures, but only in 50% of the NFH-OSE cultures. Recent ®ndings indicate that the PIK3CA gene, which encodes the p110a catalytic subunit of PI3K, is ampli®ed in most human ovarian carcinoma lines. It was suggested that this ampli®cation led to increased PI3K activity (Shayesteh et al., 1999). In the absence of evidence for PIK3CA ampli®cation in FH-OSE cells, the activation of PI3K in our FH-OSE cultures suggests that this change is the result of alternative molecular mechanisms that may or may not involve HGF. Perhaps, bioactive cytokines which are secreted by normal OSE and ovarian carcinomas modulate PI3K activity in these cells in an autocrine (and paracrine) manner (Ziltener et al., 1993). Alternatively, there might be a correlation between E-cadherin engagement at the adherens junctions and the activation of PI3K (Pece et al., 1999), since E-cadherin is expressed in metaplastic and neoplastic OSE and in FH-OSE (Wong et al., 1999). Whatever the basis for the consistent kinase phosphorylation in FH-OSE, the results of this study indicate that HGF/Met is a likely contributing mechanism.
We report here that HGF stimulates cell proliferation of human OSE cells that are cultured in serumsupplemented medium that contains, among other bioactive agents, ®bronectin. This result is in accordance with the observation that HGF is mitogenic in rat OSE when these cells are plated on a ®bronectinlike extracellular matrix (RGD peptide) (Hess et al., 1999), and that ®bronectin-integrin binding, which maintains basal levels of PI3K-dependent Akt activity, promotes cell survival (Khwaja et al., 1997). We also show that in human OSE, the MAP kinase Erk1/Erk2 signaling pathway and a rapamycin-sensitive p70 S6K pathway are equally important regulators of the mitogenic action of HGF on these cells.
Our data suggest that a mitogenic eect of HGF on OSE in vivo may facilitate postovulatory repair processes at the wound site following follicular rupture, since platelets release HGF at sites of blood coagulation. These observations support other data indicating a role for HGF in normal OSE physiology (Gulati and Peluso, 1997; Parrott and Skinner, 2000). The greater persistence of Met mRNA expression in FH-OSE adds another characteristic to the stable epithelial phenotype of these cells as compared to NFH-OSE (Dyck et al.,

HGF in human ovarian surface epithelium
AST Wong et al
1996, Wong et al., 1999). The appearance of HGF at the mRNA and protein levels that we observed in FHOSE, IOSE and neoplastic OSE suggests the existence of an autocrine HGF-Met loop, as has been implicated in the tumorigenic transformation of other cell types (Vande Woude et al., 1997; To and Tsao, 1998; Jiang et al., 1999). The signi®cance of this increased HGFMet expression in FH-OSE, compared to NFH-OSE, is at present unknown. One might speculate that, at the preneoplastic stage, a constitutive mitogenic stimulus could play a role in the propensity of FH-OSE to undergo metaplastic changes, since the phenotype of metaplastic OSE includes an increased cell density compared to the normal epithelium. Another possible role of HGF/Met, by either autocrine or paracrine means, is the facilitation of the aberrant epithelial dierentiation of ovarian carcinomas which is characterized by branching and glandular structures, i.e. forms of morphogenesis likely to be supported by HGF (Montesano et al., 1991; Tsafarty et al., 1992, 1994). Thus, coexpression of HGF/Met in FH-OSE may re¯ect increased autonomy of growth controls and dierentiation as an early step in the (pre)neoplastic progression of OSE and enhance the susceptibility of these cells to malignant transformation.

Materials and methods
Cells and cell culture
Institutional approval for experimentation with human tissues was obtained prior to this study. OSE was obtained from ovarian biopsies and at laparoscopy from 48 women (ages 27 ± 52 years; mean age 40.1 years) with no family histories of breast/ovarian cancer (NFH-OSE), having surgery for non-malignant gynecologic diseases. Another group of 20 women (ages 36 ± 55 years; mean age 45.9 years) underwent prophylactic oophorectomies because of strong family histories of breast/ovarian cancer (FH-OSE). In this group, all women had at least two ®rst-degree relatives with such cancer, and included 12 with BRCA1 mutations and four with BRCA2 mutations (Table 1). The genetic analysis for the other four women were incomplete. One of these women had a pedigree indicative of Lynch II syndrome. Histopathological analysis con®rmed the absence of neoplasms in all specimens. Several SV40 Tag-immortalized NFH-OSE and FH-OSE lines (named NFH-IOSE and FHIOSE) (Maines-Bandiera et al., 1992) and the human ovarian adenocarcinoma lines CaOV-3, OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 were included in the study. The human hepatoma line HepG2 was the negative control for HGF and positive control for Met, whereas the human lung ®broblast cell line WI-38 was the positive control for HGF. Cells were routinely grown and maintained in medium 199/MCDB 105 (1 : 1) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) with 50 mg/ml gentamicin (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA) for OSE and ®broblasts, and with 5% newborn calf serum (NCS) for ovarian cancer cell lines, at 378C in a humidi®ed incubator with 5% CO2. All cultures were subcultured at 1 : 3 split ratio with 0.06% trypsin/0.01% EDTA in Ca2+, Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cultures were de®ned as senescent if they did not reach con¯uence over 1 month. In most cases,

senescence occurred in passages 4 ± 5. As a result of this regimen, the number of cultures greatly exceeded the number of cases (women) used in this study and these terms are not synonymous. Because of the limited supply of cells, none of the cases provided sucient cultures to examine all the variables, which accounts for the relatively small sample size in some of the experiments.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT ± PCR)
Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method and cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg of total RNA using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Morgan, Canada) as previously described (Wong et al., 1999). To amplify the cDNA, the reverse-transcribed cDNA was subjected to PCR in 100 ml reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.001% gelatin, 200 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA); and 0.5 pmole of each sense and antisense appropriate primers: HGF: 5'-AGTACTGTGCAATTAAAACATGCG-3' and 5'TTGTTTGGGATAAGTTGCCCA-3'; Met: 5'-GGTGAAGTGTTAAAAGTTGGA-3' and 5'-ATGAGGAGTGTGTACTCTTG-3'; With these primers, the amplimers for HGF, Met were 378 bp (nt. 841-1219 GenBank M29145) and 324 (nt. 2667-2991 GenBank J02958), respectively. b-actin amplimer was included to normalize the relative amount of cDNA in each reaction. The ampli®cation reaction was carried over 35 cycles with each cycle of denaturation at 948C for 30 s; primer annealing at 558C for 45 s (HGF) or at 568C for 30 s (Met); extension at 728C for 30 s; and a ®nal extension at 728C for 15 min in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT, USA). PCR control was performed in the absence of cDNA to ensure that cross-contamination of samples did not occur. All PCR primers span the introns to detect speci®c mRNA sequences. One tenth of the PCR products were then loaded on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.

Southern blot analysis
The PCR products in agarose gels were transferred to Hybond N membranes (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) and hybridized with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP-labeled human HGF cDNA probe. Hybridization and detection were performed with DIG chemiluminescent detection kit (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany).
The probe used for HGF detection was a 0.8-kb EcoRI fragment (nt. 255-1102) derived from the human HGF cDNA plasmid pRS24. The cDNA fragment was labeled by the random primer method using the DIG labeling kit (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany).

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) containing freshly added phosphatase inhibitor (1 mM sodium ¯uoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate) and protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl ¯uoride (PMSF), 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ ml pepstatin A). Twenty mg of protein were separated on 7.5% SDS ± PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 3% non-fat skim milk and probed with monoclonal anti-Met antibody (clone DQ13, 1.0 ug/ml, Upstate Biotechnologies, inc.).
Oncogene

Eight NFH-OSE and six FH-OSE cultures were indirectly examined for protein kinase activities based on reduced mobility on SDS ± PAGE gels due to phosphorylation (Hulleman et al., 1999; Parrott and Templeton, 1999). Cells were lysed in buer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM sodium ¯uoride, 24 mM b-glycerophosphate, 0.005 mM b-aspartic acid and 1% v/v Triton X-100) containing freshly added protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 25 mg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 mg/ ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml aprotinin and 0.5 mM DTT). Cell lysates (50 mg) were separated on 11% SDS ± PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 30 min with 5% non-fat dried milk. Blots were then probed for 3 h with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (0.2 mg/ml) against Erk1 and Erk2 (Erk1-CT), 70 kDa S6 kinase (also called p70 S6K) (p70 S6K-pnt), Akt1 (also called protein kinase Ba) (PKBa ± CT), Akt2 (also called protein kinase Bb) ((PKBb ± CT) or glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3b) (GSK3b ± XI), raised against respective synthetic peptides (Kim et al. 1998) or integrin-linked kinase (ILK) antibody (StressGen, Victoria, Canada). The peptides used were: Erk1CT=CGGPFTFDMELDDLPKERLKELIFQETARFQPG APEAP; S6K-PNT=MAGVFDIDLDQPEDAG; PKBaCT=CRRPHFPQFSYSASSTA; PKBb-CT=CRYDSLGLLEDGRT; GSK3b-XI=CAHSFFDELRDPNVK.
After extensive washing in TBS buer with 0.05% Tween20, immune complexes were detected with mouse-speci®c secondary anti-serum conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1 : 3 000 ± 10 000) for 1 h followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL kit, Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL).
ELISA for HGF
The concentration of HGF in conditioned media of OSE and ovarian cancer cells was measured using the Quantikine HGF immunoassay kit following the manufacturer's instruction (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). HGF standard (0 ± 8000 pg/ml) and samples were pipetted into the wells of a microplate that was pre-coated with a mouse monoclonal anti-HGF antibody, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing away any unbound substances, a horseradish peroxidase-linked polyclonal antibody speci®c for HGF was added. Following thorough washing, a substrate solution was added to the wells. The product of the enzymatic reaction was determined after 30 min from the absorbance at 450 nm using a microplate photoreader (BioTek Instruments Inc.). HGF standards and all samples were assayed in duplicate, and in some cases, samples were also concentrated 2 ± 3-fold using Centricon 30 tubes (Amicon) before the assay. A wide variety of peptide hormones, cytokines and growth factors do not cross-react in this assay. The assay measures both HGF and its precursor, pro-HGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Cell growth assay
Thirteen NFH-OSE and eight FH-OSE cultures were analysed for cell growth in the presence of exogenous HGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). 2000 cells were plated in 96-well plates in medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were serum starved with 0.1% FBS overnight, and then treated without (control) or with 0.05 ± 20 ng/ml HGF in the presence of 2% FBS. To elucidate the underlying signal transduction mechanism, groups of cultures were pretreated with various inhibitors (PD98059, 50 mM; LY294002, 25 mM; SB203580, 10 mM; or rapamycin, 20 nM)

(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) or anti-HGF antibody (5 mg/ml) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in 2% FBS-containing medium for 30 min prior to the addition of recombinant HGF (20 ng/ml). Media containing both HGF and inhibitors or inhibitors alone was changed daily. Cells were grown for 6 ± 8 days and ®xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 30 min. Cell numbers were determined colorimetrically by the Methylene Blue assay (Elliott and Auersperg, 1993). In brief, cells were incubated for 30 min with 1% (w/v) Methylene Blue in 0.01 M borate buer (pH 8.5). After extensive washing in borate buer, the dye was eluted with 100 ml 1 : 1 (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 M hydrochloric acid, and the absorbance at 630 nm was measured by a microplate photoreader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.).
Scatter assay
To examine the eect of exogenous HGF, con¯uent monolayers of OSE were carefully wounded with a rubber scraper. Cultures were serum starved with 0.1% FBS, and the cells were treated in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml HGF. The experiments were repeated three times and representative ®elds were photographed.
To determine whether cultures secreted bioactive HGF, conditioned media containing 2% FBS from NFH-OSE, FHOSE, SV40-immortalized FH-OSE and ovarian carcinoma lines were concentrated 10 ± 15-fold using microconcentrating Biomax-30 tubes (Millipore). Concentrated media were added to C-4II cells, which had been plated overnight in medium 199/MCDB105 (1 : 1) plus 5% NCS in 24-well plates. The cervical carcinoma line C-4II was used because these cells are highly sensitive to HGF (Wong et al., 2000). To neutralize the bioactivity of HGF on C-4II cells, the concentrated conditioned media were incubated with the addition of 5 mg/ ml polyclonal rabbit anti-HGF antibody (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After a 24-h incubation, changes in colony shapes were assessed visually and representative ®elds were photographed. Where low concentrations of HGF were expected, the total number of C-4II colonies per culture well was counted. The shapes of the colonies were classi®ed as either round (no eect), irregular (cohort migration) (Nabeshima et al., 1998) or dissociated into single cells and small cell groups (scattering). This classi®cation was carried out blindly to avoid bias. The eects of higher HGF concentrations were obvious (e.g. Figure 3Ac,d).
Morphogenesis assay
The capacity for morphogenesis in collagen gel was performed as described, with some modi®cations (Brinkmann

HGF in human ovarian surface epithelium AST Wong et al
et al., 1995). In brief, collagen gel solution was polymerized by adding a mixture containing 7 parts of rat tail type-I collagen stock solution, 1 part each of 106 medium 199, 10% NCS and 22 mg/ml NaHCO3. The solution was then neutralized with 0.34 M NaOH. 300 ml/well of the cold neutralized collagen gel solution was plated onto 24-well plates and allowed to gel at 378C. About 26104 cells were resuspended in 300 ml neutralized collagen solution and then seeded on top of the ®rst layer. Collagen was allowed to gel before 1 ml culture medium containing 10% FBS with recombinant HGF (20 ng/ml) was added. The cultures were maintained for 21 days in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/air, with daily medium changes. The experiments were repeated three times and representative ®elds were photographed.

Densitometry and statistical analysis
Images from ECL autoradiograms were captured using NIH Image and Adobe software. Dierences in the expression level of HGF or Met receptor between NFH-OSE and FHOSE were compared for signi®cance using the Fisher's exact test. Treatments were administered in six replicates, and each experiment was performed in a minimum of three dierent cases. Data were presented with standard deviations (+s.d.) and compared by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's least signi®cant dierence post-test. Dierences were considered signi®cant at P50.05. All statistical evaluations were performed using the Prism statistical software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
