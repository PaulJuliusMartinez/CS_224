What We Are

Our Objectives

An initiative to improve graduate education, increase sharing of knowledge, help universities build their information infrastructure, and extend the value of digital libraries A federation of member universities A project supported by FIPSE and SURA A project team based at Virginia Tech A recent topic in the news Led by steering committee and a technical committee
What We Do at Virginia Tech
Require students to develop and submit Electronic Thesis or Dissertations (ETDs) Provide a web site to help students Support a digital library of ETDs Develop a workflow model for submitting ETDs Give talks Write papers
How YOU Can Participate
Come to organizational meetings Join us and develop your own NDLTD member site with our help! Contribute to our e-mail list(s)

To improve graduate education by allowing students to produce electronic documents, use digital libraries, and understand issues in publishing To increase the availability of student research for scholars and to preserve it electronically To lower the cost of submitting and handling theses and dissertations To empower students to convey a richer message through the use of multimedia and hypermedia technologies To empower universities to unlock their information resources To advance digital library technology
