· VMMs popular during 1970s
­ Multiplex expensive hardware (e.g. IBM's VM)

Why on a Commodity x86 PC?

· Hardware now cheap, software expensive!
­ Multiplex expensive software on cheap HW
· Low-level general-purpose capability
­ Many different uses, problems being solved
· Software development & testing · OS migration · Security · Many more

PC VMM Usage Examples
· SW development - develop, test, etc.
Example: Run 95,98,NT,2000
· OS Migration - Perfect legacy app. support
Example: Unix & Windows, Win98 and Win2000
· Security - Isolated environment
Example: Fault and security isolation
· Other usage: Help desks, Multi-lingual, teaching, general freedom of choice, etc.

Challenges for PC VMMs
· Traditional VMM techniques won't work
­ x86 architecture not strictly virtualizable
· Large hardware diversity in PC marketplace
­ Want to run on any PC not just a PC
· Need ease of installation and use
­ Can't force user to reinstall all software, etc.

Traditional approach to VMMs
· Virtualize all resources
­ CPU, Memory, I/O devices
· Run all VM code non-privileged
­ Trap and emulate privileged operations
· Simulated virtual I/O devices by multiplexing access to real devices

x86 CPU problems

· Same opcode have different semantics in different protection rings
­ Example: POPF
· Privileged level visible to software
­ Example: MOV AX,CS or LMSW AX
· Some MMU "features" problematic
­ Cached segment descriptors; big real mode

Hardware Diversity Problem

· VMM must "understand" hardware
­ Which video card is in your PC?
ATI, Matrox, Intel, Trident, S3, nVidia, Compaq, Dell, Diamond, Number Nine, Orchid, STB, ..
­ What SCSI card?
BusLogic, Qlogic, Adaptec, NCR, UltraStor, ..
­ What LAN card?
3COM, Intel, Digital, AMD, SMD, National, IBM,...
· Problem: Too many drivers to write

Virtualizing the x86 architecture

· x86 is "somewhat" virtualizable · Some CPU modes can be virtualized
If conditions are right, can use direct execution
Most user-level code and V8086 mode code
· Only a few instruction types are problematic
­ Examples: PUSHF/POPF, privileged insts ­ Need to interpose and emulate these

Privilege code patching

pushfd cli mov eax,(0x824) cmp eax,1 je 5 mov (0x900),edx popfd add edx,eax

<pushfd sim insts>
<cli sim insts> mov eax,(0x824) cmp eax,1 je 5 mov (0x900),edx <popfd sim insts> add edx,eax

VMware Inc.

Challenges for patching x86 inst
· Heavy use of self-modifying code in the x86 software world
· Semantics of privileged instructions are some of the less well documented ones
· Need to hide and protect the patching code in the x86 linear address space

Virtual I/O Devices

· VMM must simulate virtual I/O devices

Virtual Device Interface

E.g. IDE

I/O Device Simulator in VMM

HW Device Interface

E.g. IDE,SCSI

VMM - Direct to HW

App - Through Host OS

Dual-Mode Advantages

· Portability - Can run any OS on any HW · VMM can use Host OS services
­ VMM easily installs like an app ­ Disk can be stored in file system, etc.
· Low impact on Host OS
­ Host OS runs at speed ­ Lowers the barriers to running multiple OSes

Other Resource Virtualization

· Virtual Physical Memory

­ Uses memory pages assigned by Host OS

­ Demand paged by the monitor

­ Active working set locked by driver
· Driver acts like a device doing DMA

· Virtual I/O Devices

­ Some devices map to Host OS devices:
Floppy, CDROM, sound, serial ports, parallel ports

VMware Inc.

Virtual Device Management
· Disks
­ Raw disk partition or file in Host OS ­ COW: Undoable or nonpersistent disks
· UI Devs: Video card, keyboard, mouse
­ X window or direct framebuffer access ­ With VMware tools, cut-and-paste.

VMware Inc.

Virtual Network Management
· Virtual Ethernet bridged to Host and VMs · Can be used to share resources
­ File, printer access with Samba or NFS
· Assign an IP address to VM:
­ Access any remote service:
Printers, file servers, etc.

· Graphics-intensive a problem area
­ Can't get at all of video card accelerations ­ Need to pass-through card to VM
