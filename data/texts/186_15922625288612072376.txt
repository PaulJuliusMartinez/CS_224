Organizational research has long dealt with community-related themes such as organizational commitment, workgroup cohesion, psychological climate, and morale. More recently, psychological contracts and organizational citizenship behaviors have approached the concept of community in more specific terms (Rousseau, 1995; Graham & Organ, 1993; Van Dyne, Graham, & Dienesch, 1994). The present investigation integrated the existing literature on community-related variables. This theoretical and empirical foundation was used to operationalize the construct of psychological sense of community in the workplace (PSCW), develop a measurement system and assess its psychometric properties, and test an initial framework of antecedents and consequences of PSCW. A crossorganizational sample of 256 employees partially support the proposed framework. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

For centuries, communities have been powerful forces for creating cooperation and reliable interdependence. Communities typically took shape in towns, neighborhoods, congregations, schools, and other places where such qualities as shared responsibility, common goals, and face-to-face relationships were a necessary part of life (Sarason, 1974). In the past hundred years or so, corporations and organizations became an influential force in separating people from their traditional ties to the land, families, and communities.

Today, individuals must often find sources of meaning, identity, and support in the workplace instead of their neighborhoods because it is where they spend most of their time. Moreover, the benefits and services commonly received from the community, such as childcare, exercise facilities, and educational opportunities, are being replaced by organizations with increasing frequency (e.g., workplace wellness programs, corporate universities). Given the integral relationship of work to individual identity and psychological well-being, it is not surprising that the workplace has received attention in an expanded vision of community (Lambert & Hopkins, 1995; Klein & D'Aunno, 1986; Price, 1985; Rothman, 1982; Shinn, 1987; Wyers & Kaulukukui, 1984).
A workplace community is identifiable both as a geographic locality and as formal and informal networks of individuals who share a common association. A concept used to describe how one experiences a community environment was first discussed by Sarason (1974) as a "psychological sense of community." Sarason proposed that a psychological sense of community could be created by individuals who chose a referent, such as a business organization, to bring structure and meaning to their daily lives, and whose quality and force are in some ways a function of that entity.
Employees with a sense of community recognize that the organization meets their needs and the needs of their families, provides them with an enhanced quality of life, and expects them to be responsible citizens in the organization as well as in the larger society. The growing literature on the relationship between work and family suggests that supervisors play a major role in creating a supportive organizational climate (Karasek, Triantis, & Chaudhry, 1982; Trice & Sonnenstuhl, 1988), namely with the more sensitive supervisors making employees feel more supported (Fernandez, 1986; Hughes & Galinsky, 1988; Rodgers & Rodgers, 1989). Furthermore, employees are more likely to experience a sense of community when the organization allocates promotions fairly and provides jobs that are challenging, that encourage interaction among workers, and that enable job mastery by not overwhelming workers with job responsibilities (Lambert & Hopkins, 1995).
Overall, employees with a sense of community recognize that the welfare of the organization takes precedence over that of the individual because it is through a shared sense of community that the creative potential of the individual and the organizational community will reach expression (Sarason, 1974). Analogously, unless the psychological sense of community is an overarching value having some strength among people, feelings of isolation, loneliness, and alienation may result--which could lead to anxiety or anguish. Such decline can result in ineffective behaviors such as drug abuse, personal stress, family crises, violence, and health problems which can have deleterious effects at the individual, workgroup, organizational, and societal level (Senge, Kleiner, Roberts, Ross, & Smith, 1994).
Many empirical studies have been conducted in the area of psychological sense of community, but few have empirically examined a theory-based framework of factors related to psychological sense of community in the workplace (PSCW). Relatedly, measurement systems for PSCW have been requested by researchers (Pretty & McCarthy, 1991; Klein & D'Aunno, 1986), but only one has been developed to date (Royal & Rossi, 1996). As Shamir (1991) pointed out, there is still a need for "theories that can explain individual sacrifices for collective concerns and which account for the role of values and moral obligations in energizing and directing work behavior" (p. 153). An introduction of psychological sense of community to research in organizations could address this issue. The present investigation used theoretical foundations to operationalize the con-

struct of PSCW, develop a measurement system and assess its psychometric properties, and develop and test an initial framework of the antecedents and consequences of PSCW.
Psychological Sense of Community at Work Defined
Several definitions of psychological sense of community exist in the literature. Sarason (1974) stated that a psychological sense of community could be achieved through perceptions of similarity to others, acknowledged interdependence with others, willingness to maintain interdependence by giving to, or doing for, others what one expects from them, and feelings that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure. McMillan and Chavis (1986) proposed that sense of community may be seen as consisting of four elements. The first of these elements is membership, "the feeling of belonging or of sharing a sense of personal relatedness" (p. 9). The second community element is influence, a sense of mattering and of making a difference to a group and the group mattering to its members. The third element, integration and fulfillment of needs, has to do with the reinforcements a group provides its members to motivate their involvement in the group. The final element is shared emotional connection, "the commitment and belief that members have shared and will share history, common places, time together, and similar experiences" (p. 9). McMillan and Chavis' conceptualization of community has been applied to both schools (e.g., Pretty, Andrews, & Collett, 1994) and workplaces (e.g., Pretty & McCarthy, 1991). More recently, however, McMillan (1996) rearranged and renamed these four elements as Spirit, Trust, Trade, and Art. Finally, Klein and D'Aunno (1986) coined community in the workplace as an employee's sense of membership, participation, and identification with some work or work-related group.
Similarities can be identified between our definition of PSCW and existing definitions of the concept. The dimensions we incorporated were based on current literature and interviews with experts who provide community-building workshops to organizations. Like McMillan and Chavis' (1986) first element of membership, our dimension of Sense of Belonging addresses the trust and security component of membership and the extent to which individuals in a group are well-known to each other and willing to help each other; in essence, the "feeling of acceptance by the group and a willingness to sacrifice for the group" (McMillan and Chavis, 1986, p. 19). Like the second community element mentioned above, influence, our dimension of Coworker Support is related to the influence of the individual over group activities, as this dimension is concerned with individual's opportunities to work with others, play a part in the decision-making process, and freely express their ideas. The third element, integration and fulfillment of needs, is addressed in our dimension of Team Orientation which show concern for social support, the acknowledgment of various contributions and accomplishments, and the feeling on the part of individuals that the activities of the group are important and valuable. Our dimension of Emotional Safety is similar to the final element in McMillan and Chavis' (1986) framework, shared emotional connection, in that it addresses the extent of contact individuals in a group have with one another and to the quality of those interactions.
Two additional dimensions, Truthtelling and Spiritual Bond, are also included in our definition of PSCW. The Truthtelling dimension is based on McMillan's (1996) recommendations that the first task of a community is to make it safe for a member to tell the truth, which requires the member to have personal emotional courage to take a psychological risk, and for the community to have empathy, understanding, and caring. Additionally, Lorion and Newbrough (1996) suggest that "we need to understand what en-

hances the human spirit and what makes sense of community a spiritual matter" (p. 314), so the dimensions of Spiritual Bond was also included in the current study's definition. While this is one of the first studies to empirically examine spirituality at work, it has been discussed by many writers including Conger (1994), Peck (1978), and Senge (1990). Nonetheless, the other dimensions proposed above are similar to those posed by other authors (McMillan, 1996; Royal & Rossi, 1996; Senge, Roberts, Ross, Smith, & Kleiner, 1994; Shaffer & Anundsen, 1993) and experts who provide community-building workshops to organizations, supporting the importance of our inclusive definition and operationalization of PSCW.
Hence, we suggest that a PSCW is made up of coworker support, emotional safety, sense of belonging, spiritual bond, team orientation, and truthtelling (see Table 1 for dimension definitions). The elements of PSCW, particularly truthtelling and spiritual bonds, are unique aspects of organization behavior to be explored. They focus on whether the members of an organization honestly communicate and have deep relations with one another--relations that extend beyond the tasks of the day or the psychological economy of the workplace, but that are communal in nature. Furthermore, they assess whether the organization serves as an important place for meaning, growth, and connection for workers. Individuals with a PSCW are likely to be knowledgeable about themselves and through self-reflection, exploration, and analysis, develop relationships between their private and public lives and the formal organizational structure in which they work. These same individuals are likely to confront difficulty and discomfort when resolving internal conflicts so that their actions may be guided by a rationality that fosters a spirit of service and community in the organization.
As such, PSCW differs from traditional affect-laden group constructs, such as cohesion. Cohesion refers to "the sum total of all the forces attracting members to a group" (McGrath, 1984, p. 241) and is based on liking among group members, attraction to the task facing the group, and attraction to the status associated with group membership.

A Psychological Sense of Community at Work · 513
This suggests that for a group to be cohesive, members need to view themselves as an entity, be working toward a common task, and reap benefits associated with the group's status. PSCW, as described in the current study is clearly distinct from this construct. Most notably, PSCW does not require liking among specific group members (Groody, 1995), only a sense that the organization represents a vehicle through which individual needs can be met and that workers see themselves as part of a larger network of relationships. PSCW also differs from organization-level constructs such as affective or continuance commitment in its emphasis on reciprocal interdependence between the individual and the organization, rather than merely an individual's attachment to his or her organization (Mathieu & Zajac, 1990; Klein & D'Aunno, 1986; Meyer & Allen, 1984). Finally, PSCW differs from the notion of psychological contracts and perceived organizational support, both of which refer to an individual's obligations to his or her organization (Rousseau, 1995; Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchinson, & Sowa, 1986). While related to these constructs, PSCW is more complex and multifaceted. Specifically, a PSCW is expected to result from the reciprocal exchanges which occur between individuals and between individuals and the organization through past experiences and anticipated future interactions. In addition, PSCW encompasses commitments and attachments not typically found in perceived support or psychological contracts literature (e.g., spiritual bonds) that focus on relatedness among people and the larger world.
Antecedents of PSCW There are many possible antecedents of PSCW. Due to the lack of integrative research and the exploratory nature of the present study, several classes of antecedents were examined, representing influences at the individual, group, and organizational level. While
Figure 1. Hypothesized framework of psychological sense of community at work.

514 · Journal of Community Psychology, November 1998
not exhaustive of the variables that may be related to PSCW, these variables are representative of the variety of influences expected to impact PSCW. This initial empirical effort will provide a point of departure for future research aimed at understanding PSCW. Figure 1 illustrates the hypothesized framework of PSCW.
INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS
Two individual characteristics were examined as possible correlates of PSCW, based on existing research and theory related to psychological sense of community. This includes individuals' need for affiliation and organizational tenure.
Need for Affiliation. Need for affiliation represents a basic need reflecting an individual's desire to draw near and enjoyably cooperate with others (Murray, 1938). As such, need for affiliation can be characterized as an individual's adherence and loyalty to a friend, group, or organization, which in turn may facilitate the development of a PSCW. Supporting this notion, Davidson, Cotter, & Stovall (1991) reported a significant relationship between psychological sense of community and need for affiliation in a family setting. Extending Davidson et al.'s (1991) finding to the work context, it was expected that:
H1: Need for affiliation will be positively related to PSCW.
Organizational Tenure. Prolonged interaction has also been associated with the extent of exchange between individuals (Rousseau & Parks, 1993). Klein and D'Aunno (1986) proposed that the longer an employee has been affiliated with an organization, the more opportunities he or she has to become integrated with others in that organization. In addition, organizational tenure is consistently related to satisfaction with, and commitment to, an organization (Mathieu & Zajac, 1990). Moreover, drawing from the literature on continuance commitment (Becker, 1960), longer-term employees are more likely to have "sunk costs" in an organization such as status, pensions, and salary, which may also foster a PSCW. Finally, as tenure increases, an employee has more opportunities to participate in organizational activities and to take advantage of organizational services, enhancing overall integration into the organization. As such:
H2: O rganizational tenure will be positively related to PSCW.
GROUP AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
Two group and organizational influences are also expected to be related to PSCW. This includes the size of the employees' workgroup and the number of acquaintances known within the organization.
Size of Workgroup. A literature review revealed that the relationship between psychological sense of community and workgroup size has gone unexamined, yet the prevailing notion is that smaller systems are more amenable to the presence of psychological sense of community (e.g., Nisbet, 1962; Schumacher, 1973). Related research on small group dynamics consistently notes that smaller aggregates are likely to be more cohesive and have more satisfied members (cf. McGrath, 1984). Extending this logic, a smaller workgroup could lead to a PSCW due to increased interactions and interdependence among members.
H3: W orkgroup size will be negatively related to PSCW.

A Psychological Sense of Community at Work · 515
Employee Acquaintances. While the size of an individuals' formal workgroup may be related to a higher sense of community, the number of acquaintances within the organization may also be an indicator of the degree of interaction and integration within the informal organization. Such expanded informal networks may indicate sense of community on a broader scale.
H4: The number of acquaintances known by employees will be positively related to PSCW.
PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS
Transactional Psychological Contracts. The perception of transactional contracts may also be related to PSCW. A transactional psychological contract is defined as an economic exchange between employees and organizations, characterized by precise obligations related to an unwritten contract (Organ & Konovsky, 1989). While Emerson (1981) suggested that noneconomic exchanges such as trust, interpersonal attachment, and commitment are less likely to be related to transactional contracts, others such as employee benefits, services, and organizational activities may promote a sense of community by enhancing perceived fairness, communication, and participation. As such, both economic and noneconomic transactions were considered because of the many ways that organizations can foster the perception that transactional obligations are met. This can include providing employees with computer networking services, day care, and fitness centers, as well as encouraging common language, symbols (i.e., dress), and metaphors to evoke a feeling of support and "oneness". In addition, ongoing training and development activities (i.e., team-building, diversity training, personal awareness workshops, conflict resolution sessions) are other ways organizations can fulfill community functions. Based on this, it is expected that:
H5: Employee perceptions of a transactional psychological contract will be positively related to PSCW.
Relational Psychological Contracts. In addition to transactional contracts, relational contracts with the organization may foster PSCW. Van Dyne, Graham, and Dienesch (1994) described an individual's psychological contract with an organization as being as existential exchange in which organizational members "focus on a state of being and involve intrinsically motivated effort rather than earning something or getting somewhere" (p. 768). This more extreme form of a relational psychological contract referred to as a "covenant," redefined traditional understandings about promises, loyalties, working relationships, and roles (Graham & Organ, 1993). In that such a covenantal relationship is more than mere economic exchanges, reflecting a deeper, reciprocal relationship between individual employees, it too may foster a PSCW.
H6: Relational contracts will be positively related to PSCW.
Consequences of PSCW
A PSCW may benefit individual workers and the organization in a number of ways. The sense of community is intrinsically gratifying; therefore, it may lead to enhanced satisfaction (Klein & D'Aunno, 1986). In addition, PSCW may reinforce an organizational culture where individuals are likely to go beyond formal role requirements for the good of the organization. Thus, PSCW may also influence affective reactions toward work (i.e.,

516 · Journal of Community Psychology, November 1998
job satisfaction) as well as individual behaviors on the job (i.e., organizational citizenship behaviors).
H7: PSCW will be related to job satisfaction.
Organizational citizenship behaviors represent individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that promotes the effective functioning of the organization (Organ, 1988). The very word "citizenship" conjures up images of belonging to a community and working toward its effectiveness. This type of behavior has been referred to as "extra-role," for it cannot be accounted for by the incentives that sustain in-role behavior (Organ & Konovsky, 1989).
H8: PSCW will be related to organizational citizenship behaviors.
Research has also shown that more satisfied employees are likely to display more extra-role behaviors (Katz & Kahn, 1966; Rosenhan, Underwood, & Moore, 1974; Clark & Isen, 1982; Bateman & Organ, 1983; Organ & Konovsky, 1989). Thus, this satisfaction-organizational citizenship behavior link was also examined in the present study.
H9: Job satisfaction will be related to organizational citizenship behaviors.
This proposed pattern of relationships suggests partial mediation whereby PSCW exerts a main effect on organizational citizenship behavior (H8), as well as an indirect effect through job satisfaction (H10).
H10: P S C W, through the mediating variable of job satisfaction, will be related to o rganizational citizenship behaviors.
METHOD
Participants
Participants were 256 (160 women, 96 men) employees holding a variety of job positions across eleven organizations. Data were collected from four large companies (with hundreds or thousands of members), and seven small companies (with less than 20 members). One of the four large companies was in the automotive industry, another was in a manufacturing industry, and the other two were each in the office supply industry. The seven small organizations included retail, distributor, and service businesses. The large companies had multiple sites where data were collected. The small organizations each consisted of one location. Additional background information for the participants appear in Table 2.
Measure s
Psychological Sense of Community at Work. Despite some initial efforts to develop reliable measures of psychological sense of community (Buckner, 1988; Chavis, Hogge, McMillan, & Wandersman, 1986; Glynn, 1981; Doolittle & MacDonald, 1978; Davidson & Cotter, 1986, 1993), we could identify only one measure of psychological sense of community which was directly applicable to a work setting (Royal & Rossi, 1996). The Royal and Rossi (1996) scale was not used for this study because it does not contain some dimensions of PSCW that are inherent in our definition of the construct, namely the dimensions of truthtelling and spiritual bonds. Furthermore, their instrument was not made

available until after our data collection process began. Based on definitions offered in the literature (McMillan, 1996; Pretty & McCarthy, 1991; Klein & D'Aunno, 1986) and interviews with experts who provide community-building workshops to organizations, an item pool was constructed which consisted of 48 items measured on a 5-point Likert response scale (1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree). These items captured the six dimensions of community defined in Table 1: coworker support, emotional safety, sense of belonging, spiritual bond, team orientation, and truthtelling. The final item pool was evaluated by four independent raters: two persons involved in academics and two persons involved in applied activities centering around providing community building workshops to organizations.
Need for Affiliation. McClelland and his colleagues (1961) have devoted extensive research to the issue of measuring the need for affiliation in individuals. Three items representing need for affiliation were included in the questionnaire and utilized a 5-point Likert response format (1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree). The items were: "I like to be loyal to my friends," "I like to have strong attachments with my friends," and "I like to do things with my friends rather than by myself." High scores reflect greater need for affiliation. Coefficient alpha for this scale was .68.
Organizational Tenure. Organizational tenure was assessed on a 6-point scale ranging from less than one year (1) to more than 25 years (6).
Workgroup Size. The size of the employee's workgroup was assessed through the open ended question, "How many employees do you work closely with?"

518 · Journal of Community Psychology, November 1998
Number of Acquaintances. The number of employee acquaintances were measured on a 6point scale ranging from 1­5 (1) to more than 25 (6).
Transactional Contracts. Transactional contracts were measured through an "exchange" checklist developed for this study. Twenty-two organizational services were assessed (e.g., fitness center, daycare, picnic), and individuals responded yes or no to each of the following two categories: (1) organizational services and benefits offered to the employees, and (2) employee participation in, or utilization of, the services. Responses were dummy coded such that if an employee reported that they had not participated (used the service) in the last year or if the service was unavailable, it was coded as (0), and if the individual had participated in, or utilized the service, or the service was available, it was coded (1).
Relational Contracts. Employee perceptions of their relational contracts with the organization was measured with a 23-item scale developed by Van Dyne et al. (1994). The Relational Contract scale utilized a 5-point Likert response format (1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree), and had a coefficient alpha of .88.
Job Satisfaction. Job satisfaction was measured by the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (short form) which consists of 20 items assessing intrinsic and extrinsic facets of job satisfaction, as well as general satisfaction. This scale utilized a 5-point Likert response format (1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree) and had a coefficient alpha of .89.
Organizational Citizenship Behavior. The organizational citizenship behaviors of loyalty, civic virtue, courtesy, and altruism were combined to assess an overall measure of OCB and were measured by Van Dyne et al.'s (1994) 21-item scale. This scale utilized a 5-point Likert response format (1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree) and had a coefficient alpha of .87.
Background Variables. The demographic items of age, sex, race, job status (full/part time), tenure, and job type were included in the questionnaire.
P ro c e d u re
The measures were collected using a four-page self-report questionnaire. Prepared questionnaire packets were delivered in bulk to a contact person within the organization, who in turn distributed them to organizational members. The contact person in each organization was either the owner or reported directly to the owner or senior manager. Employee anonymity was guaranteed.
A questionnaire packet was given to each participant. The questionnaire packet consisted of an outer envelope, a cover letter from the investigator, and a questionnaire. Each questionnaire contained general instructions and a request to place the completed questionnaire back in the outer envelope provided, to seal it, and to return it to the contact person. Instructions were given at the beginning of each major section on the questionnaire. The contact person collected the completed questionnaires and returned them directly to the investigator.
RESULTS
To assess the dimensionality of the PSCW measure, exploratory factor analysis was conducted using principal components extraction with oblique rotation. Oblique rotation

A Psychological Sense of Community at Work · 519
was chosen because it was expected that the variables represented related rather than orthogonal constructs (Ford, MacCallum, & Tait, 1986). Using a minimum eigenvalue of 1.0 as the criterion for factor retention, a 9-factor solution emerged, explaining 61.5% of the total variance. Table 3 shows the results of this analysis, along with rotated factor loadings. The items within these factors formed the psychological sense of community at work (PSCW) scale.
It was expected that six factors would underlie the data, representing the following dimensions of PSCW: coworker support, emotional safety, sense of belonging, spiritual bond, team orientation, and truthtelling. As can be seen in Table 3, several of the a priori factors were supported. Specifically, Factor 1 (six items) represented the a priori factor of Emotional Safety, Factor 2 (three items) consisted of items assessing Coworker Support, Factor 3 (seven items) was consistent with the a priori factor of Team Orientation, Factor 4 (two items) represented the a priori factor of Spiritual Bond, and Factor 5 (eight items) represented a Sense of Belonging. In contrast, a single a priori factor representing Truthtelling did not emerge. Rather, an additional four factors emerged, providing evidence that the construct of PSCW was more complex than originally proposed. These additional factors were: Factor 6 (seven items), Tolerance for Individual Differences; Factor 7 (three items), Neighborliness; Factor 8 (four items), Sense of Collectivism; and Factor 8 (two items), Reflection. While nine distinct factors were found to underlie the data, a single large eigenvalue emerged supporting the presence of a general factor representing the construct of PSCW. Thus, all items were combined, yielding a coefficient alpha of .96. The relationship between PSCW and other study variables, including means, standard deviations, and reliabilities, appear in Table 4. A PSCW was found to have a relatively strong direct bivariate relationship with the predictor variables of covenant relations, job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behaviors.
Path analysis was performed based on the recursive model (Asher, 1983) presented in Figure 1. To control for the potential confounding effect of sex and full-time/parttime status, both of these variables were partialled out for all subsequent analyses. A series of ordinary least squares regression equations whereby each endogenous (dependent) variable was regressed on its antecedent variables was employed to obtain the path coefficients (Billings & Wroten, 1978; Cohen & Cohen, 1983). Residual path coefficients (XR) (Asher, 1983) for the endogenous variables were also computed, representing the correlation of each endogenous variable with unobserved variables. These residual coefficients were calculated using the formula for R2 adjusted for shrinkage (Cohen & Cohen, 1975) where XR  1  R2j.1,2...i (Pedhazur, 1997).
Standardized path coefficients are shown in Figure 2, with each coefficient representing the direct relationship between the variables of interest. As can be seen in Figure 2, several of the hypotheses were supported. Specifically, need for affiliation was positively related to PSCW (H1,   .07, p  .05) as was transactional contracts (H5,   .13, p  .01) and relational contracts (H6,   .76, p  .001). In terms of the strength of the observed relationships, relational relationships was the most highly related to PSCW, followed by transactional relations, and need for affiliation. In contrast, no support was found for the proposed relationship between tenure (H2,   .08, p  .05), size of workgroup (H3,   .03, p  .05), number of acquaintances (H4,   .04, p  .05), and PSCW.
Path analysis also allowed for the examination of the mediating role of job satisfaction in the PSCW-organizational citizenship relationship. Based on the results, job satis-

I benefit from the skills or knowledge of my coworkers. The friendships and associations I have with other people in this organization mean a lot to me. This organization feels like a community.
Tolerance for individual differences In this organization, people usually break-up into cliques.c After meetings, people say negative things about others, usually in a gossipy fashion.c People's feelings in this organization are just as accepted as their thoughts and ideas. Differences and conflicts are dealt with openly in this organization. People in this organization see each other as a larger group supporting one another, rather than maintaining separate "turfs" or "territories". There is a high level of respect for others in this organization. Individual differences are tolerated in this organization.
Neighborliness If I needed advice about something I could go to someone in this organization. I borrow things and exchange favors with my coworkers. There are people who really care about me in this organization.
Sense of collectivism I like to think of myself as similar to the people who work in this organization. I think I agree with most people in this organization about what is important in life.

faction partially mediated the PSCW-organizational citizenship relationship. Specifically, the relationship between PSCW and job satisfaction was significant (H7,   .70, p  .01) as was the path between job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behavior (H9,   .22, p  .001). Furthermore, the direct path between PSCW and organizational citizenship was significant (H8,   .50, p  .01) when job satisfaction was included in the regression equation. This pattern of results supports partial mediation whereby the effect of PSCW on organizational citizenship behaviors appears to operate by enhancing job satisfaction (H10). The residual variance associated with the endogenous variables are shown in Figure 2, and the total variance accounted for by all model variables was .62% (based on the adjusted R2).1
As with all research obtained by a single method, it is possible that common method variance may have inflated some of the relationships. Researchers disagree about the degree to which common method variance poses a threat to survey research (Crampton & Wagner, 1994; Williams, Cote, & Buckley, 1989). Nevertheless, based on the recommendation of Podsakoff and Organ (1986), a one-factor test was conducted to explore the possibility of common method effects. This involved submitting all variables to a principal components analysis and examining the first unrotated solution to see if the majority of variance was accounted for by this first factor. Results of this analysis showed that 26 factors emerged with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 and the first unrotated factor accounted for 25.8% of the variance. This suggests that one general (method) factor does not appear to underlie the data, and thus, common method variance is not likely to be a threat to validity in the current study (Padsokoff & Organ, 1986).

DISCUSSION
The findings of this study contribute to the literature on a sense of community in a number of ways. First, the study helps to further define a sense of community at work by con-

1Indirect effects between the variables in the proposed framework were computed by multiplying the direct path coefficients comprising each relationship of interest (Billings & Wroten, 1978). These indirect effects are shown in Table 5 for the interested reader.

ceptualizing and developing a measure of PSCW and assessing its psychometric properties. Based on exploratory factor analysis, the construct of PSCW appeared to be a complex and multidimensional phenomenon. While initial support was found for five of the six a priori dimensions, several additional factors appeared to underlie the data. These additional dimensions included items which described a tolerance for individual differences, neighborliness, sense of collectivism, and reflection. All of these dimensions are related to contact among individuals which continues to enhance the shared emotional connection that helps to maintain a sense of community (McMillan & Chavis, 1986). Second, the study provides some insights into an initial framework of factors related to the PSCW construct.
In terms of exploring the variables related to PSCW, results of the path analysis indicated that the proposed framework was partially supported. As expected, both relational and transactional contracts had a strong relationship with PSCW. One explanation for the relational contract finding is that a PSCW can develop among workers who share common experiences, develop emotional closeness, and whose group membership conveys a recognition of common identity and destiny (Heller, 1989). Such a reciprocal relationship has been referred to as "relational communities" because a sense of community develops out of the mutually supportive relationships of its members (Heller, 1989; Rothman, 1982). In addition, the finding related to transactional contracts provides further support for the benefits associated with supportive workplace policies such as child care, fitness centers, and university courses (Goldberg, Greenberger, Koch-Jones, O'Neil, & Hamill, 1989; Greenberger, Goldberg, Hamill, O'Neil, & Payne, 1989). Although studies have revealed that employees like these policies even when they do not personally benefit from them (Bohen & Viveros-Long, 1981; Kamerman & Kahn, 1987), some support is provided here that the more workers use the workplace supports available to them and develop an economic exchange with the organization, the more they will experience

526 · Journal of Community Psychology, November 1998
a PSCW. All in all, these findings provide support for the psychological contracts, suggesting that the arrangement of returns provided by an organization influences the way people view employment relationships which, in turn, determines their attitudes (Rousseau, 1995; Schein, 1980). If these psychological contracts are not violated, a sense of community may develop from these mutually supportive relationships.
Another finding was that individuals with higher need for affiliation appeared to have a stronger PSCW. This relationship is consistent with social­psychological research concerning interpersonal attraction and social networks (cf. Byrne, 1971; Fischer, 1977). It is possible that employees who feel a need for affiliation are attracted to coworkers who share similar attitudes and opinions than their own. These individuals may provide supportive assistance which in turn bolsters ones PSCW.
The results regarding the mediating role of job satisfaction on the PSCW-organizational citizenship relationship also provides support for the proposed framework. Specifically, it was expected that job satisfaction would emerge as a partial mediator of this relationship. That is, we anticipated that there would be direct effects from PSCW to organizational citizenship behavior in addition to effects operating through job satisfaction. The results of this study support a partial mediation effect. This finding provides some empirical support for Heller's (1989) belief that the importance of communities lies in their ability to function as "mediating structures in that they serve to connect individuals to the larger social order while providing a vehicle for the satisfaction of personal needs through group attachments" (p. 6). This idea that there is a relationship between the individual and the larger group, in this case the work organization, appears key to defining a sense of community.
Limitations
While this study was one of the first to develop a multidimensional measure of PSCW and explore its correlates, it is not without its limitations. One limitation is that all of the data was collected by a single administration of a survey, making it impossible to draw conclusions about causality. It seems unlikely that exogenous variables such as need for affiliation and workgroup size were the outcome of PSCW. However, the causal relationships between other variables is less clear (e.g., PSCW, job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behaviors). While not tested in this study, it is possible that a reciprocal relationship exists between some of these variables. For instance, PSCW may foster initial perceptions of job satisfaction, and in turn job satisfaction may further enhance ones PSCW. To fully understand these relationships, future research using longitudinal designs is necessary.
Second, as with most surveys, it would seem that those who would most likely respond would be those who were more literate, more involved in their organization (either positively or negatively), or perhaps those who felt more in line with the organization's leadership. Thus, these results probably do not generalize to those who consider themselves marginal or outsiders within the organization, except to the degree that these people desire to express themselves. The fact that the survey was anonymous may have encouraged some responders from such groups, but suspicion or trust regarding the anonymity safeguards was not measured and may have inhibited some expressive outsiders from responding.
Similarly, a third issue to consider is that while this study concentrated on a positive psychological sense of community (at work), the concept of a "negative" psychological

A Psychological Sense of Community at Work · 527
sense of community (Negative PSOC) has been recently investigated by Brodsky (1996). In her study, negative PSOC was shown to play a role in the way successful single mothers cope with and moderate the potentially negative effects of their community on themselves and their family. This concept has not yet been applied to the work setting and may provide a fruitful avenue for future research. For instance, it may be the case that some employees may feel that there is something better for them outside of the organizational community that makes active membership not in their best interest. In addition, independence from the organizational community may be perceived by some employees as a means to conserve needed strength and resources while striving for success. These are only a few ideas for future research on this topic.
A fourth factor limiting generalization regards the nature of the sampled organizations. The majority of the data were drawn from the automotive, manufacturing, and office supply industries. Although other types of organizations were involved, they accounted for a small proportion of the sample. Larger studies within an industry would be useful to determine the degree of within-industry consistency of PSCW. Even larger between-industry studies would be required to understand inter-industry differences. The degree to which these findings generalize to other types of organizations (e.g., nonprofit, social, governmental) remains an open question. Similarly, future studies may wish to address issues relating to race/ethnicity, gender, and job status (i.e., blue-collar versus white-collar, upper management versus line personnel, etc.).
Directions for Future Research
This study highlights many avenues for future research. First, psychological sense of community has been studied in many contexts (e.g., neighborhoods, schools, workplaces) and recent research has pointed out that its development and correlates may change from setting to setting (Hill, 1996). However, there has not been an in-depth examination of which elements are common across situations. According to Hill (1996), "the fact that measures have been successfully used in diverse settings argues strongly for the presence of common elements" (p. 434). While our measure of PSCW was developed based on elements that were theorized and partially confirmed in prior research across settings, a meta-analytic study of the antecedents and correlates studied to date in various community settings would provide many readers with a broader understanding of the variables operating with this construct. In addition, a moderator analysis by type of setting could be used to examine whether relationships among antecedents and correlates are situation-specific.
Second, it appears that there is little research on PSCW, yet this variable appears to be conceptually and statistically distinct from other related constructs. Interested parties may use our PSCW measure to gather data and better provide evidence of its reliability and validity. Furthermore, it is recommended that there be a continued exploration of the nomological network of variables related to PSCW in addition to examinations of the causal relationships among important variables.
Third, it is possible that PSCW may be operating at multiple levels of analysis. Based on the present study, sense of community appears to operate as an individual perceptual phenomenon, directly influencing both job satisfaction and citizenship behaviors. However, it is possible that shared perceptions of community may exert an independent effect on important outcomes at the individual and group level. For example, shared

528 · Journal of Community Psychology, November 1998
sense of community at work may impact individuals efficacy in their ability to tackle challenging tasks because of the perceived support available in the workplace. Further, shared perceptions of community at work may affect aggregate outcomes, such as overall absenteeism or turnover rates within an organization, due to a common sense of responsibility in the workplace. Due to the increasing popularity of examining organizational phenomenon at multiple levels of analysis (Ostroff, 1992, 1993), this is a particularly interesting area for future research.
Fourth, future research may also investigate "virtual communities" (Rheingold, 1991) in that there has been a growth of individuals who meet and regularly write to one another via computer, especially in the workplace. These computer conferences are becoming more commonplace, yet there is little research available which investigates the benefits of this means of communication. Some have criticized this approach as contributing to the compartmentalizing of our lives (Bellah, Madsen, Sullivan, Swidler, & Tipton, 1985), as it may either shift the way we acquire a sense of community at work, or may be a factor in its decline (Hill, 1996).
Finally, future studies may investigate PSCW and personality variables. It may be, for example, that extroverts are more attracted to organizations which offer greater opportunities for interaction, friendship, and social cohesion and also have a stronger sense of community (Lounsbury & DeNeui, 1996). As McMillan and Chavis (1986) pointed out, members are more attracted to a community where they feel that they can meet their needs.
Applications
Several practical implications of the present study are worth considering. For example, the measurement system derived in this study may be of interest to practitioners and individuals attempting to build a sense of community within an organization. This measure may be of particular interest to some given that the item pool was developed with the assistance of two experts who have many years of experience providing community building workshops to organizations. Used as an assessment tool, it could help identify areas in need of change interventions (e.g., manager­subordinate relations, work group relations), as well as be used diagnostically with other types of organizational change efforts (e.g., team-building, training). While management cannot change employees' personal characteristics or those factors external to the job or organization, it has a wide choice of change strategies available over which it does have control and which may affect PSCW. After all, building a sense of community acts as a mechanism to stimulate the healthy development of the environment and the people who inhabit it (Chavis & Wandersman, 1990).
Just as an understanding of PSCW may provide theorists with a conceptual link between the elements of individuals, groups, and organizational systems, it may provide managers with a link between their organization's procedures and practices and the concerns and needs of individual workers. Managers must know how different procedures and practices stimulate, or fail to stimulate, employee needs--and how worker motivation can be enhanced. To gain this understanding, the dynamics of PSCW must be studied, for PSCW may represent a direct determinant of motivation. By studying their own working communities, managers may learn to appreciate the subtle relationships between their own managerial behaviors and the motivational behavior of their work force.
Furthermore, an understanding of employee PSCW may have implications for personnel selection practices. It would seem that organizations should publish or make avail-

A Psychological Sense of Community at Work · 529
able descriptions of their psychosocial environment and evidence of a community orientation to facilitate recruitment of personnel who are more likely to be committed to the organization.
Concluding Thoughts
Industrialization has been criticized as an acting force in the breakdown of community by bringing about the decline of rural villages, homogenous social arrangements, opportunities to maintain a sense of personal efficacy, and functional, as opposed to personal interactions (cf. Durkheim, 1964; Lawrence, 1930; Morgan, 1957; Scherer, 1972). Although we have moved beyond the early belief that urbanization per se always results in a loss of community and increased feelings of alienation, there still seems to be the prevailing belief that something inherent in modern American society has robbed from us our sense of community, and that we need to do something to get it back (Hill, 1996). The establishment of a PSCW could restore bonds and support systems which no longer seem to typify social life outside the organization. Hopefully, community researchers will continue to define ways in which a sense of community could be fostered in the very places that were once charged with its demise in society.
