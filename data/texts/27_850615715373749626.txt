I Introduction Tephra (or volcanic ash) studies, once confined largely to volcanic lands, have become increasingly practised in countries far removed from areas of active or recent volcanism ­ and Australia is no exception. At the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) conference in Cairns in July/August 2007, Sarah E. Coulter (née Davies), now a postdoctoral ice-core tephrochronologist at Queen's University Belfast, reported the first occurrence of an exotic tephra in Australia in a core from Lynch's Crater, Atherton Tableland, Queensland (Figure 1).
The distal tephra, manifest as a tiny concentration of glass shards, was probably derived from a Papua New Guinean eruption around 75,000­80,000 years ago (S.E. Davies et al., 2007). Its value lies in providing a precise chronostratigraphic marker that potentially allows correlation of other long palaeoenvironmental sequences over wide distances. Davies' study is but one of a revolutionary development in tephrochronology now focused on detecting diminutive, distal tephras that are invisible in the field and referred to as cryptotephras. From the Greek word kryptein, meaning `to hide' (Hunt, 1999a; Hunt and Hill, 2001; Lowe and Hunt, 2001),

cryptotephras typically comprise fine-ashsized (< ~100 µm) glass shards sparsely preserved and `hidden' in peats or in lake, marine or aeolian sediments, or in ice cores (Figure 2). The cryptotephra theme is continued in section III, but beforehand nomenclature associated with the term `tephra', which can be confusing and which sometimes is used incorrectly, is outlined.
II Tephra nomenclature Tephras (from the Greek tephra meaning `ashes') are the explosively erupted, unconsolidated pyroclastic (or `fiery fragmental') products of volcanic eruptions. They encompass all grain sizes: ash (grains < 2 mm in diameter), lapilli (2­64 mm), or blocks or bombs (> 64 mm). Unless reworked, a tephra layer has the same age wherever it occurs and thus, once it has been characterized or `fingerprinted' by its mineralogical and geochemical properties, provides a timeparallel stratigraphic marker bed or isochron (Figure 3).
Tephrochronology in its original sense (sensu stricto) is the use of tephra layers as isochrons to connect or correlate sequences by providing precise tie-points, and to transfer relative or numerical ages to such

Figure 1 View of part of Lynch's Crater, northern Queensland, from which a core containing the first exotic cryptotephra to be recorded in Australia was taken. The crater, about 600 m in diameter, was formed c. 250,000 years ago and contains over 60 m of lake sediments and peat (Muller et al., 2008) (photo: David J. Lowe)
Figure 2 Micrographs of medium-ash-sized glass shards preserved as part of a midHolocene cryptotephra in peat near Hamilton, central North Island, New Zealand (after M.J. Gehrels et al., 2006). These grains, ~100 km from source, are ~150­250 µm in diameter. Such grains are preferably described as `glass shards' rather than `tephra shards' as reported in some literature. Shards have to be polished flat before analysis by electron microprobe (photo: Maria J. Gehrels)

Figure 3 Nomenclature of tephra and derivative terms and their relationships with one another and with other terms including near-synonym pyroclastic material. `Tephra', by definition unconsolidated or `loose' pyroclastic material, is used in four different senses (bold italics across central part of figure). The terms listed under the rectangular boxes at the very bottom are unnecessary (Lowe and Hunt, 2001) (this figure is available in colour at http://ppg.sagepub.com/).

sequences where the tephras have been dated by (1) radiometric (eg, radiocarbon, fission-track, Ar/Ar), (2) incremental (eg, dendrochonology, varved sediments, layering in ice cores), or (3) age-equivalent methods (eg, palaeomagnetism, correlation with marine oxygen isotope stages). In short, tephrochronology is a stratigraphic linking, dating and synchronizing tool. Tephrochronometry is the dating of a tephra layer either directly or indirectly; tephrochronology is the transference using stratigraphic principles of that date from one location to another where the same tephra occurs. In recent times, the term tephrochronology (sensu lato) has been used more broadly to describe all aspects of tephra studies ­ as used in the title of this article and as the overarching descriptor near the top of Figure 3.
Undertaking tephrochronology (both senses) always requires tephrostratigraphy to some degree. Tephrostratigraphy is the study of sequences of tephras and associated deposits and their stratigraphic relationships (superpositions) and relative ages. It involves defining, describing and characterizing tephra layers using their physical, mineralogical or geochemical properties from field or laboratory-based observations, or both (Figure 3). Cryptotephrostratigraphy is identical in meaning except that it refers to the stratigraphic study of tephra-derived glassshard concentrations, typically ash-grade, that are encompassed within sediments but which are not visible in the field as layers. The term `cryptotephra' has replaced the antecedent term `microtephra', which is now seen by most as a misnomer.
Note that the letter `o' rather than `a' is the appropriate connecting letter in all these terms derived from tephra, and that the adjective `volcanic' is redundant when referring to tephra. The term `airfall' is no longer used (tephra-fall or tephra fallout, or ash-fall or ash fallout if appropriate, are employed instead).
Several other words in useage have tephra or tephrós (`ash coloured') at their root but

nAone is relevant to tephrochronological studies. `Tephrite' refers to a typically ash coloured alkalic basaltic volcanic rock erupted effusively as lava, not explosively. `Tephroite' is a mineral [Mn2SiO4] in the olivine group that is commonly ash-grey to olive or bluish green in colour. And `tephromancy' is divination by means of ashes, requiring supernatural insight! Further etymological and historical perspectives regarding the use of `tephra' are given by Lowe & Hunt (2001) and Alloway et al. (2006).
III Cryptotephras As signalled above, an entirely new generation of tephrochronologists has been undertaking novel research into cryptotephras in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, the North Atlantic and adjacent seas, the Adriatic and Mediterranean seas, the Gulf of Aden, and around 24 countries, now including Australia (Table 1). Distal cryptotephras or very thin visible englacial tephras have also been studied in glaciers in Iceland and in the South Shetland Islands near the Antarctic Peninsula (Larsen et al., 1998; Pallàs et al., 2001; Brandt et al., 2005; Kirkbride and Dugmore, 2006), and in Victoria Land (Curzio et al., 2008; Harpel et al., 2008) and Marie Byrd Land (Dunbar et al., 2008).
Although a handful of pathfinding cryptotephra studies existed (see Table 1), the new, systematic cryptotephra work has required the development of innovative or especially adapted techniques firstly to identify and then to extract or concentrate glass shards (which may be  20 µm in size at very distal locations) from sediments ­ and to quantify shard counts (Pilcher and Hall, 1992; Takemura and Danhara, 1994; Rose et al., 1996; Blackford, 1997; Turney, 1998; Hall and Pilcher, 2002; Mackie et al., 2002; Blockley et al., 2005; Andrews et al., 2006; M.J. Gehrels et al., 2006). Extraction techniques include ashing (burning) or acid digestion to remove encapsulating organic matter, or density separation. Filtration and

centrifugal concentration methods are used on melted ice-core samples (eg, Davies et al., 2008). Methods to render shards `visible' in cores include X-radiography (eg, Lowe, 1988a; Dugmore and Newton, 1992; Turner et al., 2008b), light reflectance and luminescence (Caseldine et al., 1999), magnetic susceptibility (Haberle and Lumley,

Japan. The use of resin-impregnated peat thin-sections, developed using a freeze-drying technique, allows for in situ observations to be made via polarizing and fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, or XRF-based core scanning (de Vleeschouwer et al., 2008). An XRF core scanner has been trialled by Schupack et al. (2008) for its potential to detect submillimetre-resolution cryptotephras in lake sediments.
Special considerations such as postdepositional glass or mineral stability, including the effects of microbial attack, have also been examined (Gardner et al., 1985; Ross and Fisher, 1986; Hodder et al., 1991; Dugmore et al., 1992; Thorseth et al., 1992; 1995; Hunt and Najman, 2003; Pollard et al., 2003; de Vleeschouwer et al., 2008). Hunt and Hill (2001) showed that reducing beam sizes for electron microprobe analysis of very small shards or pumiceous shards with thin walls can lead to unreliable or distorted geochemical analyses and hence potentially invalid correlations. Examinations of the very interesting but complex taphonomic problem of possible glass-shard migration through soft sediment or peat, and associated stratigraphic implications, have also been initiated (eg, Beierle and Bond, 2002; Payne et al., 2005; Enache and Cumming, 2006; M.J. Gehrels et al., 2006; S.M. Davies et al., 2007). Austin et al. (2004) demonstrated that anomalously coarse glass shards in marine sediments in MD95­2006 from the northeastern Atlantic Ocean were deposited initially as ash-fall but were then transported to the core site probably via sea ice rafting (see also Davies et al., 2008).
Cryptotephra studies allow integrated tephrochronological frameworks to be developed over much larger areas than previously possible by extending the geographical limits of eruptives (in some cases > 2000­ 3000 km), thereby providing isochrons for wide-ranging palaeoenvironmental and geoarchaeological or anthropological applications (Turney et al., 1997; Wastegård et al., 2001; Davies et al., 2002; Payne et al., 2008)

(Table 2). They also provide a basis for reevaluating volcano eruption histories and modelling volcanic hazards and assessing their economic and other costs (eg, Newnham et al., 1999a; Shane and Hoverd, 2002; Wulf et al., 2004; Magill et al., 2006; Shane et al., 2006; Turner et al., 2008a). A number of studies have made the point that medial or distal localities, paradoxically, may provide the most comprehensive record of volcanism because of burial or erosion (or other factors) at proximal sites (eg, Lowe, 1988b; Alloway et al., 2005; 2006; Shane, 2005; Larsen and Eiríksson, 2008; Turner et al., 2008a). With the advent of cryptotephra studies, distal sites have become increasingly important in providing the most comprehensive dossiers of volcano eruption histories. Nowell et al. (2006) attempted to use tephra records to demonstrate a broad linkage between volcanism in Germany and France and Quaternary climate but their database of eruptions is likely to be underestimated because events (presumably of lower magnitude) recorded by cryptotephras were not considered in their modelling.
General protocols for robust analysis and correlation have been developed (Turney et al., 2004; D.J. Lowe et al., 2008). The next step ­ building comprehensive geochemical databases ­ is under way (Newton et al., 2007).
IV Developments in dating, analytical and statistical methods As well as advances via cryptotephra studies, several other important developments have contributed to the growing application of tephrochronology (Alloway et al., 2006) (Table 2). First, the development of the isothermal-plateau fission-track dating method (ITPFT) for glass has enabled ages to be obtained on many distal tephras that previously were unable to be dated because their main component, glass, was unreliable because of annealing (eg, Westgate, 1989; Sandhu and Westgate, 1995; Westgate et al., 2006). Excellent examples of such an application are the dating of initial loess

Table 2 Some recent advances in methodology and applications in global tephra studies

Advance/method

Application

(1) Cryptotephra studies: identifying, correlating and dating sparse ash-sized glass-shard concentrations (not visible as layers) `hidden' within sediments including ice

Extending isochrons over wider areas, some >1000 km from volcano source (hence see 4), and improving records of volcano eruption history and thus developing better models of volcanic hazards and their mitigation

(2) Isothermal-plateau fission-track dating of glass (ITPFT)

Dating tephras (especially those comprising only glass shards), hence dating landscapes or palaeoenvironmental or geoarchaeological sequences not previously datable at distal and other locations

(3) Laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) and ion microprobe analysis of single grains

Correlation and identification of tephras using traceelement and REEs of glass shards (especially of tephras with similar major-element compositions as determined by electron microprobe), with enhanced reliability obtained using single-grain analysis that can reveal magma mingling or contamination, or stratigraphic irregularities

(4) Connecting and dating palaeoenvironnmental sequences and geoarchaeological deposits with high precision using tephras (or cryptotephras) as isochrons

Classical tephrochronology applied in high-resolution palaeoclimatic projects such as INTIMATE to test synchronization of stratigraphic records, correcting for marine reservoir or hard-water effects, and dating, integrating and interpreting human-environmental interactions in antiquity (eg, RESET project)

(5) Bayesian probability analysis of age sequences involving tephras

Bayesian methods are providing enhanced and more precise chronologies for tephrostratigraphic sequences, especially for the last 26,000 calendar years spanned by IntCal04, via OxCal, Bpeat or BCal (etc)

(6) Recognition of heterogeneity in the composition of some tephras, especially high versus low K2O contents; mainly by analysis of glass components but also of some minerals (eg, biotite)

Petrological insight into magma processes such as mingling and volcano eruptive histories, including the finding that multiple fingerprints of some tephras differ according to direction of dispersal

(7) Improving the reliability of electron microprobe-derived analyses of andesitic glass using geochemical models

Novel procedure to evaluate and correct for common microlite contamination in andesitic glass shards, thereby increasing the potential of andesitic tephras as marker beds

(8) `Neoformation' of International focus group on tephrochronology and volcanism (INTAV) (predecessor groups include SCOTAV and COT)

INQUA-based global group of tephrochronologists with interests in developing and improving analytical techniques reliably to characterize tephras, to map their distributions and improve volcano eruptive histories, to develop high-precision age models for them, and to apply tephrochronology to numerous disciplines as a precise correlation and dating tool

deposition in Alaska at ~3 million years ago (Westgate et al., 1990), dating Quaternary glacioeustatic sedimentary cycles in the Wanganui Basin, North Island, New Zealand

(Pillans et al., 2005), and dating marine tephra sequences near New Zealand, thus testing chronologies based on alternative methods (Alloway et al., 2005).

Second, the applications of high-precision analytical techniques include the electron microprobe technique that was developed initially by Smith and Westgate (1969). Froggatt (1983; 1992) made further refinements to the method (see also Hunt and Hill, 1993; 1996; 2001; Hunt and Najman, 2003) so that it is now routine and widely accepted (eg, Shane, 2000; Turney et al., 2004; Alloway et al., 2006). In the Yukon Territory and Alaska, Jensen et al. (2008) used existing probe-based geochemical databases to facilitate tephra correlations but additionally reanalysed samples of potential correlatives at the same time they analysed the unknown tephras to eliminate possible small day-today differences in probe calibration. Such reanalysis of potential correlative tephra beds is seen as an integral step because of the chemical similarity of many Yukon-Alaska tephra deposits (Westgate et al., 2008).
More recently the method of laserablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) has made it possible to obtain detailed trace-element and rare-earth element (REE) compositions from individual glass shards and for fingerprinting individual tephra beds or tephra successions of similar mineralogy or provenance (ie, to separate beds that are compositionally indistinguishable from one another with regard to major elements) (Westgate et al., 1994; 2008; Eastwood et al., 1999; Pearce et al., 1999; 2002; 2004a; 2007; 2008a; Denton and Pearce, 2008). The main advantage of a single-grain technique is that it allows mixed populations to be identified (such mixing arising from magmatic or volcanic eruption processes, or from postdepositional blending of thin tephras in soil-forming environments or the dissemination or attenuation of glass shards in peat or lake sediments). Another advantage is illustrated by the use recently of LA-ICPMS to critically evaluate the stratigraphy of Ocean Drilling Program Site 1123, about 1000 km east of New Zealand (Carter et al., 2004), using new tephra `fingerprints' basedon trace element ratios(eg,Sr/Y,Zr/Th)

and REE analyses (Allan et al., 2008). It was shown that some tephra layers, with similar major element compositions, had been included in the composite 1123 record more than once because a repeated ~4-m long section in 1123A and 1123C cores had not previously been recognized. The weak correlation of part of the oxygen isotope curve (between about 1.2 and 1.4 million years ago) of Site 1123 with other Southern Hemisphere records was thus able to be explained by the tephrochronological discovery of this stratigraphic irregularity (Allan et al., 2008).
Analyses by ion microprobe (secondary ionization mass spectrometry, SIMS) are also now being undertaken (eg, Clift and Fitton, 1998; Begét and Keskinen, 2003; Dunbar et al., 2003; Shane et al., 2007a; Denton and Pearce, 2008) and look set to expand as the technique becomes more readily available (SIMS systems are very expensive). Analyses of mineral phases such as biotite, amphiboles, or Fe-Ti oxides (as well as glass) for correlation have been utilized where present in proximal to medial (less distal) settings (eg, Cronin et al., 1996b; Shane, 1998; Shane et al., 2003; 2007a; 2007b; Smith et al., 2006; D.J. Lowe et al., 2008).
Third, the application of statistical analysis to aid tephra correlation, including the use of discriminant function analysis (Beaudoin and King, 1986; Stokes and Lowe, 1988; Stokes et al., 1992; Shane and Froggatt, 1994; Perkins et al., 1995; Cronin et al., 1996a; 1996b; 1997; Charman and Grattan, 1999; Eden et al., 2001; Turney et al., 2008), the statistical (Euclidian) distance function D or D2 (Perkins et al., 1995), which is a variation of the similarity coefficients method (SarnaWojcicki and Davis, 1991; Dunbar et al., 2003; Knott et al., 2007; Harpel et al., 2008), cluster analysis (King et al., 1982; Baron et al., 2008), or Student's t-test (Keenan, 2003), has returned to the limelight ­ albeit with some strong disagreements (Hunt and Hill, 1993; Kuehn and Foit, 2006; Pollard et al., 2006; 2008; Pearce et al., 2004b; 2008b; Denton and Pearce, 2008; Hillenbrand

et al., 2008). Statistical correlation is an area poised for significant improvement but which ultimately will rely on the development of more comprehensive, stratigraphically constrained regional tephrostratigraphic and geochemical databases of uniformly high quality.
V Tephrochronology as a high-precision `synchronization' or correlation tool Another critical development has been the enhanced use of tephrochronology to affect more precise correlations between marine, ice-core and terrestrial records. This fastexpanding application holds the key to testing the reliability of high-precision correlations

between sequences and current theories about the degree of synchroneity of climate change at regional to global scales ­ provided the tephra correlation is certain (eg, see Denton and Pearce, 2008). Numerous studies in just the past decade have utilized this unique chronostratigraphic capability (eg, Newnham and Lowe, 1999; Newnham et al., 1999b; 2003; 2007a; Wastegård and Rasmussen, 2001; Litt et al., 2003; Negrini et al., 2004; Langdon and Barber, 2004; Suzuki et al., 2005; Vandergoes et al., 2005; Wastegård et al., 2005; Wohlfarth et al., 2006; Brauer et al., 2007; Kristjánsdóttir et al., 2007; Davies et al., 2008; Hillenbrand et al., 2008) (Figure 4).

Blockley et al. (2007b), for example, showed that there is now potential to independently test climate synchroneity between Greenland and Europe as far south as the Alps (>3000 km) via the Vedde ash (see also Schmidt et al., 2002; van den Bogaard and Schmincke, 2002; Turney et al., 2006b). Similarly, Rasmussen et al. (2008) correlated the NGRIP, GRIP and GISP2 ice-core records across marine oxygen isotope (MOI) stage 2 using mainly tephras as a means of applying the recent NGRIP-based Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) to the GRIP and GISP2 ice cores and thus facilitating the synchronized palaeoclimate profiles of the cores in detail. Previously, tephra-aided correlations of marine records and the Greenland ice cores extending to MOI stage 5 were made by Wastegård and Rasmussen (2001) and Rasmussen et al. (2003). A critical finding from Greenland ice cores recently has been the revelation that glass shards may occur without the coeval chemical signals (sulphate spikes or electrical conductivity measurements) normally used to recognize a volcanic event in them (Mortensen et al., 2005; Davies et al., 2008). Thus more cryptotephras especially may now be detectable by sampling ice layers without sulphate signals (Davies et al., 2008).
The Australasian INTIMATE project, built along similar lines to the hugely successful INTIMATE project (Integration of ice-core, marine and terrestrial records) of the North Atlantic (Björck et al., 1998; J.J. Lowe et al., 2001; 2008), aims to erect a climate event stratigraphy for the region for the past 30,000 years. The main Australasian results thus far have been published by Turney et al. (2006a) and Alloway et al. (2007). The role of tephrochronology in linking all of the selected palaeoenvironmental records (apart from those based on speleothems) has been highlighted. The advantage provided by key marker tephras in the New Zealand (NZ) INTIMATE project led to the development of new compositional data and new

age models based on Bayesian probability methods (D.J. Lowe et al., 2008).
Together with wiggle-matching methods, Bayesian modelling, derived ultimately from the theorem of eighteenth-century Englishman Thomas Bayes, is adding another revolutionary aspect to the construction of enhanced and more precise chronologies in tephrochronology (Buck et al., 2003; Hajdas et al., 2006; Wohlfarth et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2007; Barber et al., 2008; Blockley et al., 2008; Schiff et al., 2008). Associated paleoenvironmental reconstructions are now being developed using a range of Bayesian software including OxCal, Bpeat, BCal, and Bchron (eg, Blockley et al., 2004; 2007a; Buck, 2004; Blaauw and Christen, 2005; Blaauw et al., 2007; Bronk Ramsey, 2008; Haslett and Parnell, 2008). One of the NZ-INTIMATE marker tephras, Konini tephra, which was erupted from the andesitic stratovolcano Mt Taranaki and dated using Bayesian modelling at 11,720 ± 220 calendar years BP (2-s age range) (D.J. Lowe et al., 2008), marks the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary for the proposed Australasian parastratotype, namely a core from North Island's c. 20,000 year-old Lake Maratoto. The core is one of a number of global parastratotypes erected to support the recent designation of the NGRIP ice core as the global stratotype section and point (GSSP) for the base of the Holocene Series/Epoch (Quaternary System/Period), which is dated at 11,700 years before AD 2000 (± 99 years at ~95% probability) (Walker et al., 2008). Similarly, the Ulmener Maar tephra in the Eifel maar lakes, Germany, and the U-Oki tephra in Lake Suigetsu, Japan, provide markers near the Pleistocene/Holocene boundaries for these proposed parastratotypes for Europe and eastern Asia, respectively.
Tephras also provide the means to help quantify the marine reservoir effect for correcting the marine-based radiocarbon timescale, as shown by studies in the

Mediterranean Sea, the North Atlantic and the South Pacific (Austin et al., 1995; Hunt et al., 1995; Haflidason et al., 2000; Sikes et al., 2000; Siani et al., 2001; Rasmussen et al., 2003; Ascough et al., 2005; Ohkushi et al., 2007; Carter et al., 2008; Davies et al., 2008). Further, they enable AMS-based radiocarbon dating of pollen concentrates or biological remains to be evaluated (Litt et al., 2003; Newnham et al., 2007b), and demonstrating and hence correcting for the `hard water' effect in dating lake sediments (eg, Lowe et al., 1997; Newnham et al., 1998a; Child and Werner, 1999).
Tephrochronology, long used to provide ages on early hominins (eg, Sarna-Wojcicki et al., 1985; Walter, 1994; WoldeGabriel et al., 2005; McDougall and Brown, 2006; Spoor et al., 2007), is being increasingly applied to archaeology and studies of humans in antiquity, including determining the timing and extent of initial human impacts on landscapes such those of Great Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Albania, and New Zealand (eg, Bennett et al., 1992; Hall et al., 1993; Dwyer and Mitchell, 1997; Newnham et al., 1998b; Dugmore et al., 2000; Lowe et al., 2000; Hogg et al., 2003; Wastegård et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2004; Bescoby et al., 2008) (Table 2). The somewhat contentious issue of `environmental determinism' ­ such as impacts of volcanic eruptions on early societies or on human migration and evolution ­ are also being studied (eg, Grattan et al., 1999; McCoy and Heiken, 2000; Lowe et al., 2002; Machida and Sugiyama, 2002; Manning and Sewell, 2002; Oppenheimer, 2002; 2003; Ambrose, 2003; Gathorne-Hardy and Harcourt-Smith, 2003; Pearce et al., 2004b; Sidle et al., 2004; Hall and Mauquoy, 2005; Friedrich et al., 2006; Grattan, 2006; Riede, 2008; Cashman and Giordano, 2008; Neall et al., 2008). The potential key role of cryptotephrochronology in underpinning the study of the adaptation of humans to climatic change in Europe since about 20,000 years ago was highlighted by Blockley et al. (2006). That potential is now being put to the test

with RESET (Response of humans to abrupt environmental transitions), a five-year consortium project led by John Lowe (Royal Holloway, University of London, UK) and funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, UK, together with support from the National Research Council, Italy. RESET began in January, 2008. It aims to construct a new chronological framework, at the core of which are visible and cryptotephras, for testing the hypothesis that major shifts in human development coincided with, or immediately followed, some prominent abrupt environmental transitions in the recent geological past.
VI Magmatic heterogeneity and multiple fingerprints Another key development from a volcanological perspective has been the discovery, from detailed analyses of thick sequences of proximal tephras erupted from the Okataina volcanic centre in central North Island, New Zealand, of much more compositional diversity within individual lapillisized clasts and at different azimuths (compass directions) around the volcanic centre than previously recognized (Shane et al., 2008) (Table 2). This heterogeneity is a consequence of the mingling of separate batches of magma that were tapped simultaneously or sequentially, accompanied by changes in wind direction as eruptions proceeded (Smith et al., 2005; 2006; Shane et al., 2006; 2008). The recognition of more than one magma type in most of the Okataina-derived tephras has in some circumstances increased their potential for precise correlation in that some tephra beds might be identified uniquely, even where stratigraphic control is uncertain, because they were derived from two or three magma batches and so have multiple fingerprints (or `handprints' as coined by D.J. Lowe et al., 2008). However, it is also evident that the newly recognized heterogeneity has increased complexity and potentially ambiguity, and glass compositions of some

322 Progress in Physical Geography 32(3)

eruptive phases may overlap those for other tephras. An implication is that some tephras may have been misidentified in the past.
The heterogeneity warns of the difficulty of fingerprinting tephra beds using a limited set of distal samples from restricted dispersal sectors (Shane et al., 2008). Similar warnings about heterogeneity have been reported for some magmas/tephras in Italy (Santacroce et al., 2008), in the Greenland/ North Atlantic region (Pearce et al., 2004b; Pyne-O'Donnell, 2006; Pyne-O'Donnell et al., 2008), in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean (Hillenbrand et al., 2008), and with respect to a distal tephra in Croatia (Jahns and van den Bogaard, 1998). Earlier studies on this subject include those by Federman and Scheidegger (1984) and Carr and Walker (1987).
The correlation of andesitic tephras in New Zealand using glass composition generally has not been straightforward for various reasons (Shane, 2005; Shane et al., 2007b; D.J. Lowe et al., 2008), one being the wide compositional range in a single unit that may arise because of plagioclase microlites. However, a new evaluation procedure using mixing calculations to reduce microprobe-determined glass heterogeneity arising from such microlites has recently been published by Platz et al. (2007). It should facilitate significant advances to be made in identifying and correlating andesitic tephras (see also Donoghue et al., 2007).
VII Global tephra community and publications Returning to Australasia and the global scene, papers presented at the Cairns INQUA meeting in 2007 were part of a series generated by the international tephra group that operates under the auspices of INQUA. Now called the `International focus group on tephrochronology and volcanism' (INTAV), its executive for the 2007­2011 period comprises president Siwan Davies (University of Wales at Swansea, UK), vice-president Phil Shane (University of Auckland, Auckland,

New Zealand) and secretary David J. Lowe (University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand). (To join INTAV, type `Tephra' in the `by list name' box top right at www. jiscmail.ac.uk. Searchable archives of internet discussions on tephra studies are at www. jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/TEPHRA.html.) Although first formed in the mid-1960s, the antecedent global tephra group was wound up in the early 1980s but resurrected in 1987 as the Intercongress committee on tephrochronology (ICCT), eventually becoming the Commission on tephrochronology (COT) in 1991, and then the Subcommission on tephrochronology and volcanism (SCOTAV) from 1995 until 2007 when it morphed into INTAV. Members have organized intercongress fieldbased meetings and workshops from time to time including in western USA (1990), northern New Zealand (1994), and southern France (1998), the most recent being the 2005 `Tephra Rush' meeting in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada. INTAV is part of the Stratigraphy and chronology commission of INQUA but it also contributes to others ­ such as the INTIMATE project within the Palaeoclimate commission ­ and potentially could feature in projects within all commissions.
INTAV members have recently published 20 papers in a volume of Quaternary International entitled `Global Tephra Studies' (Froese et al., 2008) that commemorated the achievements of recently retired tephrochronologists John Westgate (University of Toronto, Canada) and Andrei SarnaWojcicki (USGS, Menlo Park, California, USA). The exceptional careers of both were featured in editorials. The volume also contains an obituary on one of the true pioneers of New Zealand tephrochronology, Colin Vucetich. Previous tephra-focused volumes in the Quaternary International series were edited by Westgate et al. (1992) and Lowe (1996). Hunt (1999b) edited a special issue on distal tephras for Global and Planetary Change; Juvigné and Raynal (2001) edited a volume entitled `Tephras ­ chronology,

archaeology' that arose from the 1998 meeting in France; and Hall and Alloway (2004) edited a special `Tephras' issue for PAGES News.
Recent substantial overviews of tephrochronology, each with a regional focus, have been written by Sarna-Wojcicki (2000), Shane (2000) and Turney and Lowe (2001). A wider view has been provided by Alloway et al. (2006), and Walker (2005) contains a section on the subject including several case studies. An earlier well-cited book, Tephra studies, arose from a NATO-sponsored meeting in Iceland in 1980 (Self and Sparks, 1981). Numerous review articles on explosive volcanism and tephras are available in Sigurdsson (2000).
VIII Summary and conclusions Tephrochronology, the characterization and use of volcanic-ash layers as a unique chronostratigraphic linking and dating tool, has become a globally practised discipline of immense practical value in a wide range of subjects including Quaternary stratigraphy, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology, palaeolimnology, physical geography, geomorphology, volcanology, geochronology, archaeology, human evolution, and anthropology. The advent of systematic studies of cryptotephras ­ the identification, correlation and dating of sparse, fine-grained glass-shard concentrations `hidden' within sediments ­ over the past 10­15 years has been revolutionary. New techniques developed in northwestern Europe and Scandinavia in particular, adapted or improved to help solve problems as they arose, have now been applied to sedimentary sequences (including ice) on all the continents of the world, most recently Australia. The result has been the extension of tephra isochrons over wide areas hundreds to several thousands of kilometres from source volcanoes. Taphonomic and other issues, such as understanding and quantifying uncertainities in correlation (eg, see SUPRAnet project `Studying uncertainty in palaeoclimate reconstruction: a network'

at www.caitlin-buck.staff.shef.ac.uk/ SUPRAnet/), provide plenty of scope for future work, however.
Developments in dating and analytical methods have led to important advances in the application of tephrochronology in recent times. In particular, the ITPFT (glass fission-track) method has enabled landscapes and sequences to be dated where previously no dates were obtainable or where dating was problematic; the LA-ICPMS method for trace element and rare-earth analysis of individual shards is generating more detailed and more robust `fingerprints' for enhancing tephra-correlation efficacy; and the revolutionary rise of Bayesian probability age modelling has helped to improve age frameworks for tephras of the Lateglacial to Holocene period especially (coincident with the radiocarbon calibration period for which there is international agreement, eg, see D.J. Lowe et al., 2008). Developments in the understanding of magmatic heterogeneity at some volcanoes have shown that multiple fingerprints may arise according to tephradispersal direction during a `single' eruption episode, adding complexity and the need for a careful approach in making long-range correlations. New debates on how various statistical methods should be used to aid correlation have emerged recently. The application of tephrochronology (and cryptotephrochronology) is now seen as a key correlation or `synchronization' tool in highresolution palaeoclimatic projects such as INTIMATE and in dating, integrating and interpreting human-environmental interactions in antiquity (eg, RESET project).
INTAV, the leading INQUA-based global group of tephrochronologists, remarkably, now contains many geoscientists working in non-volcanic countries. These `neo-tephrochronologists' have added new enthusiasm and skills to those of the geoscientists working on the typically thick, complex, multi-sourced tephrostratigraphic sequences in `traditional' volcanic regions ­ Japan, New Zealand, Iceland, Italy, and

western USA, for example ­ in an excellent example of intra-disciplinary mutualism. Each subgroup is learning from the other, and new directions and advances in tephrochronological research are assured.
