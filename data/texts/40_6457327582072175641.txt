In this paper a novel method of noise reduction in color images is presented. The new technique is capable of attenuating
both impulsive and Gaussian noise, while preserving and even enhancing the sharpness of the image edges. Extensive
simulations reveal that the new method outperforms signiﬁcantly the standard techniques widely used in multivariate signal
processing. In this work we apply the new noise reduction method for the enhancement of the images of the so called gene
chips. We demonstrate that the new technique is capable of reducing the impulsive noise present in microarray images and
that it facilitates efﬁcient spot location and the estimation of the gene expression levels due to the smoothing effect and
preservation of the spot edges. This paper contains a comparison of the new technique of impulsive noise reduction with
the standard procedures used for the processing of vector valued images, as well as examples of the efﬁciency of the new
algorithm when applied to typical microarray images.

1. Introduction

Multichannel signal processing has been the subject of
extensive research during the last decade, primarily due
to its importance to color image processing. The most
common image processing tasks are noise ﬁltering and
image enhancement. These tasks are an essential part of
any image processing system, no matter whether or not
the ﬁnal image is utilized for visual interpretation or for
automatic analysis (Mitra and Sicuranza, 2001; Pitas and
Venetsanopoulos, 1990; Plataniotis and Venetsanopoulos,
2000).

It has been widely recognized that the processing of
color image data as vector ﬁelds is desirable due to the
correlation that exists among the image channels and to
the fact that the nonlinear vector processing of color im-
ages is the most effective way to ﬁlter out noise. A number
of nonlinear, multichannel ﬁlters which utilize the corre-
lation among multivariate vectors using various distance
measures were proposed (Astola and Kuosmanen, 1997;
Mitra and Sicuranza, 2001; Pitas and Venetsanopoulos,
1990; Plataniotis and Venetsanopoulos, 2000). The most
popular nonlinear, multichannel ﬁlters are based on the
ordering of vectors in a predeﬁned sliding window. The

output of these ﬁlters is deﬁned as the lowest ranked vec-
tor according to a speciﬁc ordering technique (Astola and
Kuosmanen, 1997; Astola et al., 1990). In this way, a set
of reference vectorial ﬁlters, such as vector median ﬁlter
(VMF) (Astola et al., 1990), basic vector directional ﬁl-
ter (BVDF) (Trahanias and Venetsanopoulos, 1993) and
the directional distance ﬁlter (DDF) (Trahanias et al.,
1996), was developed. These nonlinear ﬁlters, based on
the ordering operation, provide robust estimation in en-
vironments corrupted by bit errors, impulsive noise and
outliers.

In general, the success of the searching for an image
close to the undisturbed original depends on the complex-
ity of the image scene, the nature of the corruption pro-
cess and also on the accuracy of the adopted measures of
the restoration (Astola and Kuosmanen, 1997; Bardos and
Sangwine, 1997; Plataniotis and Venetsanopoulos, 2000).

Although the well-known vector ﬁlters hold good im-
pulse noise attenuation characteristics, their performance
is often accompanied with undesired processing of noise-
free samples, which results in edge and texture blurring.
The reason is that these nonlinear ﬁlters do not satisfy the
superposition property (its nonlinearity is caused by the

370

ordering operation) and, thus, the optimal ﬁltering situa-
tion can be never fully achieved.

In the case of the impulse noise corruption, the aim
of the optimal ﬁltering is to design noise reduction algo-
rithms that would affect only corrupted samples, whereas
the desired (noise-free) samples should be invariant under
the ﬁltering operation. This is realized by adaptive median
ﬁlters, which replace the noisy samples by the median of
the input set spanned by a ﬁlter window and perform the
identity operation on the noise-free samples. The mea-
sure of the output distortion depends on the capability of
the ﬁlters to detect atypical image samples—impulses and
outliers, which can be very similar to samples belonging
to an edge.

This paper focuses on a new nonlinear vector ﬁlter-
ing scheme based on center-weighted vector median ﬁlters
and robust order statistic theory to achieve optimal ﬁlter-
ing properties. The proposed method improves the signal
detail preservation capability and provides a higher ﬂex-
ibility of the ﬁlter design in comparison with the widely
used VMF, BVDF and DDF techniques. In addition, its
computational complexity is acceptable, which allows its
application for the enhancement of DNA microarray im-
ages (Leung, 2002; Yang et al., 2002). Using the new
ﬁltering scheme, it is possible to achieve an excellent bal-
ance between the signal-detail preservation and the noise
attenuation. These properties of the proposed method
were tested for a wide range of multichannel image sig-
nals, such as the standard color images (Lena and Peppers)
and DNA artiﬁcial and real images.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In the next section, the relevant vector ﬁltering schemes
such as VMF, BVDF, DDF and weighted vector median
ﬁlters are described. In Section 3, we provide a new vec-
tor ﬁlter and analyze it in terms of detection operation,
smoothing capability and signal-detail preservation. Sec-
tion 4 is devoted to the analysis of the proposed methods
depending on the intensity of impulsive noise corruption.
This section also contains a number of simulations, tests
and ﬁltering results, together with tables and graphs de-
picting the objective image quality measures. We tested
all relevant methods for standard color images and for
DNA images, and also provided a short description of the
microarray cDNA images. Finally, main ideas, results and
suggestions for future work are summarized.

2. Multichannel Filtering Schemes

In multichannel image ﬁltering, standard color images
represent the vector-valued image signals, in which each
image pixel can be considered as a vector of three com-
ponents associated with the intensities of color channels
consisting of red (R), green (G) and blue (B). Thus, it

R. Lukac and B. Smołka

is necessary to consider the correlation that exists among
the color channels and to apply the vector processing. If
the existing correlation is not taken into account and color
channels are processed independently, then the ﬁltering
operation is applied componentwise, (Fig. 1). In general,
componentwise (marginal) approaches produce new vec-
tor samples, i.e., color artifacts, caused by the composition
of reordered channel samples.

Fig. 1. Filtering methods for color images: (a) marginal

ﬁltering, (b) vector processing.

Vector ﬁlters represent a natural approach to the
noise removal in multichannel images, since these ﬁlters
utilize the correlation between color channels. For this
reason, the vector methods represent the optimal and at-
tractive approaches to denoising color images.

The most popular nonlinear, multichannel (vector)
ﬁlters are based on the ordering of vectors in a predeﬁned
sliding window. The output of these ﬁlters is deﬁned as
the lowest ranked vector according to a speciﬁc ordering
technique (Astola et al., 1990; Peltonen et al., 2001; Pitas
and Tsakalides, 1991; Pitas and Venetsanopoulos, 1992;
Smołka et al., 2002; Tang et al., 1995).

Let y(x) : Z l → Z m represent a multichannel im-
age, where l is an image dimension and m characterises
the number of channels. If m ≥ 2, then it is the case of
multichannel image processing. In the case of the stan-
dard color images, parameters l and m are equal to 2
and 3, respectively. Additionally, let x1, x2, . . . , xN be a
set of input multichannel samples such that xi ∈ Z l for
i = 1, 2 . . . , N.

In general, the difference between two multichan-
nel samples xi = (xi1, xi2, . . . , xim) and xj =
(xj1, xj2, . . . , xjm) can be quantiﬁed through the com-
monly used Minkowski distance

where γ characterizes the employed norm, m is the di-
mension (number of channels) of vectors and xk
is the
i
k-th element of the sample xi. Note that the well-known
Euclidean distance corresponds to γ = 2.

Because vector ﬁlters respect the natural correlation
that exists among color channels, each image sample is
processed as a vector of channel intensities. The output of
vector ﬁlters based on the robust order-statistic theory is
deﬁned as the lowest ranked vector, according to the spe-
ciﬁc ordering technique (Astola et al., 1990; Bardos and
Sangwine 1997; Gabbouj and Cheickh, 1996; Karakos
and Trahanias, 1997; Lukac, 2001; Smołka et al., 2002).
Let us consider an input sample xi, i = 1, 2, . . . , N,

associated with the distance measure Li given by

Li =

kxi − xjkγ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

Another way to express the distance of multichannel
samples is based on the angle between two multichan-
nel samples xi = (xi1, xi2, . . . , xim) and xj =
(xj1, xj2, . . . , xjm):

A(xi, xj) = cos−1

Let each input sample xi, for i = 1, 2, . . . , N, be
also associated with the sum of angular distances deﬁned
by

αi =

i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

and the ordered set is given by

Ω(1) ≤ Ω(2) ≤ ··· ≤ Ω(N ),

then the same ordering scheme applied to the input set
results in the ordered sequence

x(1) ≤ x(2) ≤ ··· ≤ x(N ).

(8)

The sample x(1) associated with Ω(1) represents
the output of the directional distance ﬁlter (DDF) (Bar-
dos and Sangwine, 1997; Trahanias and Venetsanopoulos,

1993; Trahanias et al., 1996). Although the minimization
of products Liαi, i = 1, 2, . . . , N does not necessarily
imply a minimum for either of Li or αi, it results in very
small values for both of them. For that reason, the prod-
uct minimization will select as a ﬁlter output the vector-
valued sample that produces a very small sum of vector
distances (2) and a very small sum of vector angles (4),
simultaneously.
Let us assume the DDF with the power parameter p
so that the power 1 − p is associated with the sum of
vector distances and the power p (from interval [0, 1]) is
associated with the sum of vector angles. Thus, Eqns. (5)
and (6) can be simply rewritten respectively as
i = 1, 2, . . . , N,

Ωi = L1−p

(10)
If p = 0, the DDF operates as the vector median
ﬁlter (VMF) (Astola et al., 1990), whereas for p = 1,
the DDF is equivalent to the basic vector directional ﬁl-
ter (BVDF) (Trahanias and Venetsanopoulos, 1993). For
p = 0.5, the deﬁnition (9) is identical with (5), since the
sum of vector distances and the sum of vector angles have
equivalent importance.

Let x1, x2, . . . , xN be an input set determined by a
ﬁlter window and N represent a window size. Let us as-
sume that w1, w2, . . . , wN represent a set of nonnegative
integer weights so that each weight wj, j = 1, 2, . . . , N
is associated with the input sample xj. Then, it is possible
to express the weighted vector distance Ji as

Ji =

wj kxi − xjkγ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , N.

(11)

j=1

The sample x(1) ∈ {x1, x2, . . . , xN} associated
with the minimal combined weighted distance J(1) ∈
{J1, J2, . . . , JN} is the sample that minimizes the sum
of weighted vector distances. Note that the description

J(1) ≤ J(2) ≤ ··· ≤ J(N )

(12)

characterizes the ordered sequence of weighted vector
distances. The sample x(1)
represents the output of
the weighted vector median ﬁlter (WVMF) introduced in
(Viero et al., 1994). Equivalently, the WVMF can be de-
ﬁned by

(13)

372

It is clear that in the dependence on the weight coef-
ﬁcients w1, w2, . . . , wN the WVMF can perform a wide
range of smoothing operations, so that the optimal weight
vector can be found for each ﬁltering problem.

3. Proposed Method

The vector median ﬁlter is designed to perform a “ﬁxed”
amount of smoothing. In many applications, it may be-
come an undesired property and in some image applica-
tions the vector median ﬁlter introduces too much smooth-
ing and blurs ﬁne image details and even image edges.
For that reason, the common problem is how to preserve
some desired signal features when removing the noise el-
ements with the vector median ﬁlter. An optimal situa-
tion would arise if a ﬁlter could be designed so that the
desired features would be invariant to the ﬁltering opera-
tion and only noise would be affected. Many contributions
have provided different solutions to the problem of how to
minimize the undesired effect of the vector median ﬁlter-
ing using fuzzy logic, noise density estimations, subﬁlter
structures and various restrictions imposed on the central
sample (Lukac, 2002; 2003; Smołka et al., 2001; 2002;
Szczepanski et al., 2002).

Ideally, the noise reduction ﬁlter should be designed
in such a way that the noise-free samples should be
invariant under the ﬁltering operation and only noise-
corrupted pixels should be affected by the ﬁlter action.
In other words, in the case of noise-free samples, the ﬁl-
ter should perform the identity operation (no ﬁltering),
whereas noisy samples should be replaced by the VMF. In
order to provide an adaptive trade-off between the identity
ﬁlter and the VMF, we present a new ﬁltering scheme as a
signiﬁcantly simpler special case of the approaches intro-
duced in (Smołka et al., 2002), which makes use of var-
ious smoothing levels of the center-weighted vector me-
dian ﬁlters (CWVMFs).

Consider the weight vector given by

( N − 2k + 2

wj =

1

for j = (N + 1)/2,
otherwise,

(14)

i.e., the weight vector of nonnegative integer weights,
where only the central weight w(N +1)/2 associated with
the central sample x(N +1)/2 can be changed, whereas
other weights associated with the neighboring samples re-
main equal to one. Notice that k = 1, 2, . . . , (N +1)/2 is
a smoothing parameter. If the smoothing parameter k is
equal to one, then the CWVMF is equivalent to the iden-
tity operation and no smoothing will be performed. In the
case of k = (N + 1)/2, the maximum amount of smooth-
ing will be performed and the CWVMF ﬁlter is equivalent
to the VMF. By varying k between 1 and (N + 1)/2, it

R. Lukac and B. Smołka

is possible to achieve the best balance between the noise
suppression and the signal-detail preservation.

The CWVMF framework is more adequate for an
adaptive ﬁlter design that will vary the smoothing levels
in the ﬁltering process, than the WVMF with a full set
of weight coefﬁcients (Alparone et al., 1999; Viero et al.,
1994). Because of the complexity of the ﬁlter design re-
lated to the optimal setting of N weight coefﬁcients, the
WVMF optimization framework needs local or global op-
timization approaches to perform an optimal smoothing
(Lucat et al., 2002; Lukac et al., 2003a; 2003b). Thus,
the WVMF may fail in a situation with different statisti-
cal properties caused by an increased or a decreased noise
probability or various distributions of the edges in the im-
age. Note that the optimal WVMF ﬁltering comes from
optimization and ﬁlter design strategies used in gray-scale
image ﬁltering by means of weighted median (WM) ﬁl-
ters, (a family of WM optimization approaches was sum-
marized in (Yin et al., 1996)).

The optimized WM ﬁlters are characterized by the
same drawback (a ﬁxed smoothing function) as the opti-
mized WVMF ﬁlters. To remove this drawback, recent
works (Chen and Wu, 2001; Chen et al., 1999; Lukac
and Marchevsky, 2001a) in the ﬁeld of gray-scale image
ﬁltering provide adaptive methods based on the center-
weighted median (CWM) ﬁlters or on equivalently de-
ﬁned lower-upper-middle (LUM) smoothers. The CWM
(LUM) ﬁltering structure is characterized by a tuning pa-
rameter, i.e., the center weight in CWM ﬁlters and the
parameter for the smoothing in LUM smoothers. Let us
denote this parameter by k. Varying the tuning parame-
ter k, a class of CWM ﬁlters (LUM smoothers) allows the
construction of a wide range of smoothing ﬁlters. Note
that the adaptive designs use some kind of local control
to choose the smoothing level which provides the best
balance between the noise smoothing and signal-detail
preservation.

The research of (Chen and Wu, 2001) brought the
methodology of impulse detection based on the full set of
CWM smoothing characteristics. Note that the CWM ﬁl-
ter (LUM smoother) can be designed to perform (N +
1)/2 smoothing realizations, including the identity op-
eration and the well-known median ﬁlter.
In this work,
the detection operation is performed using the set of
(N + 1)/2 inequalities

(cid:13)(cid:13)yk − x(N +1)/2

(cid:13)(cid:13)γ ≥ Tolk,

(15)

where yk is the CWM output corresponding to the tuning
parameter k, x(N +1)/2 is a central (reference) sample of
the sliding window and Tolk is a ﬁxed threshold. If any
inequality deﬁned by (15) is satisﬁed, the central sample
is considered to be an impulse or an outlier. Note that
for the increasing smoothing capability, (see Eqn. (14))

Application of the adaptive center-weighted vector median framework for the enhancement of cDNA. . .

373

ranging from the identity ﬁlter (i.e., no smoothing corre-
sponding to the maximum central weight) to the median
ﬁlter (maximum smoothing for the central weight equal to
one), the threshold values of adaptive CWM ﬁlters satisfy
the condition

Tol1 ≤ Tol2 ≤ ··· ≤ Tol(N +1)/2

(16)

that corresponds to an increasing sequence

(cid:13)(cid:13)y1 − x(N +1)/2

(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤(cid:13)(cid:13)y2 − x(N +1)/2
≤ ··· ≤(cid:13)(cid:13)y(N +1)/2 − x(N +1)/2

(cid:13)(cid:13)

(cid:13)(cid:13) .

(17)
The presented approach with a 3 × 3 sliding win-
dow achieves very good results. However, because of the
necessity of using all possible CWM ﬁlters, this way is
very ineffective with the increasing window size. Thus
it prohibits the straightforward optimization of necessary
parameters and practically excludes the hardware imple-
mentation, especially for standard ﬁltering with a 5 × 5
sliding window or in the ﬁeld of image sequence ﬁlter-
ing, where the spatiotemporal ﬁlters with a cube window
of N = 27 samples are used, as the most practical ap-
proaches (Lukac and Marchevsky, 2001a; Viero et al.,
1994). Note that in this situation, the method of (Chen
and Wu, 2001) would require (N + 1)/2 = 14 CWM
ﬁlters and the optimization of the same number of thresh-
old parameters. The same extension would be also re-
quired in (Lukac and Marchevsky, 2001b), in which a
similar approach to multichannel ﬁltering was introduced.
In order to decrease the number of smoothing levels and
necessary thresholds, and to simultaneously simplify the
optimization process, a new method working with a re-
duced set of smoothing levels was elaborated in (Lukac
and Marchevsky, 2001a).

In order to avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks
and make the ﬁlter design more ﬂexible for changes
in the basic ﬁlter parameters such as the size and the
shape of the ﬁlter window, we provide the adaptive cen-
ter weighted vector median ﬁlter (ACWVM) that will vary
the extreme CWVM smoothing levels between the iden-
tity and the VMF operation. The proposed switching
scheme is well suited for impulsive noise removal as it
is able to ﬁlter only corrupted samples, whereas the de-
sired image features are invariant to the ﬁltering operation.
The ACWVM is based on dividing the samples into two
classes, namely probably corrupted samples and probably
noise-free samples. As the decision tool for the central
sample x(N +1)/2, the following rule is applied:

IF Val ≥ Tol

THEN x(N +1)/2 is impulse
ELSE x(N +1)/2 is noise-free,

(18)

where ‘Tol’ is the threshold parameter and ‘Val’ is the
aggregated sum of τ distances deﬁned in (15),

greater than or equal to the threshold value Tol, then
the central input sample x(N +1)/2 is most probably cor-
rupted and it will be processed by the VMF. In the case
where the operation value Val is smaller than the thresh-
old value Tol, the central sample x(N +1)/2 is most prob-
ably noise-free and it should be invariant to a ﬁltering op-
eration. Note that the proposed ACWVM ﬁlter requires
only one threshold value in comparison with (N + 1)/2
thresholds used in (Chen and Wu, 2001). In the case of
color video ﬁltering by spatiotemporal ﬁlters with a cube
window, the proposed method will utilize the same num-
ber of 4 smoothing levels (three levels for the computation
of the operation value Val and the maximum smoothing
level for the impulse rejection), whereas in (Chen and Wu,
2001) 14 smoothing levels and the same number of thresh-
olds have to be used.

4. Experimental Results

4.1. Experimental Results Achieved Using

the Standard Color Images

In order to obtain the best performance of the proposed
method, we performed some experiments related to set-
ting parameters λ and Tol for a ﬁxed value of τ = 2.
As the training images, we used the well-known test im-
ages (Figs. 2(a) and (b)) Lena and Peppers degraded by
impulsive noise (Fig. 2(c)) (Astola and Kusmonen, 1997;
Boncelet, 2000; Lukac, 2002; Lukac et al., 2002; Platani-
otis and Ventesanopoulos, 2000) given by

where i and j characterize the sample position, oi,j
is the original sample, xi,j represents the sample from
the noisy image, pv is a corruption probability and v =
(v1, v2, . . . , vm) is the noise vector of random intensity
values.

From the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 it can be ob-
served that the optimal values of Tol and λ were found
to be 80 and 2, respectively. Note that the achieved thresh-
old value Tol = 80 yields a sufﬁciently robust ﬁlter for a
wide range of heavy-tailed noise characteristics and also

for practical extensions of the 3 × 3 ﬁlter window to
larger sizes and different shapes. Note that the proposed
method includes the standard VMF ﬁltering (Tol = 0) and
the identity operation (Tol → ∞) as special cases.

As regards the simplicity of the optimization process
corresponding to the minimization of the chosen error cri-
teria depending on the threshold value Tol, the proposed
method can effectively adapt itself to changing noise and

signal statistics, and therefore the optimal parameters
Tol = 80 and λ = 2 are sufﬁciently robust, as can be
seen from the results depicted in Tabs. 1–5.

In general, the restoration quality of digital images
is evaluated through the commonly used objective cri-
teria (Plataniotis and Venetsanopoulos, 2000), such as
the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Square Er-
ror (MSE) and the Normalized Color Difference (NCD),

is shown in Figs. 6(a)–(c).
It can be easily observed
that the standard ﬁlters suppress well impulses present in
the image, yet some edges and image details are heavily
blurred, especially at transitions between image regions.
In the case of the BVDF, the increased estimation error
(Fig. 6(b)) is caused by pure directional processing.
In
some situations, the decreased noise attenuation capabil-
ity of the BVDF may result in the presence of impulses in
the ﬁltered image. Since the DDF combines the properties
of both the VMF and BVDF, it suppresses noise well and
reduces the edge jittering effect. The output of the pro-
posed ACWVM ﬁlter, cf. Fig. 6(f), is characterized by an
excellent balance between signal-detail preservation and
noise suppression, which is reﬂected in the very small
estimation error depicted in Fig. 6(f). The objective re-
sults evaluated by the commonly used measures such as
MAE, MSE and NCD are listed in Tabs. 1 and 2. The
proposed method excels signiﬁcantly over all standard ﬁl-
tering schemes, and it also provides excellent balance be-
tween noise suppression and signal-detail preservation.

4.2. Experimental Results Achieved Using

cDNA Images

The cDNA microarray is a popular and effective method
for simultaneously assaying the expression of large num-
bers of genes (Chen et al., 1997; Conway et al., 2002;

Dopazo, 2002; Eisen and Brown, 1999; Schena et al,
1995) and is perfectly suited for the comparison of gene
expressions in different populations of cells.

A microarray is a collection of spots containing
DNA, deposited on the surface of a glass slide. Each of
the spots contains multiple copies of a single DNA se-
quence. In comparative gene expression experiments, the
array is incubated with two cDNA probes, each of which
is a mixture of cDNA’s derived from the expressed mRNA
of a distinct cell population. Each of the probes is labeled
with a different ﬂuorescent dye and then the labeled cDNA
molecules hybridize to spots on the array containing their
complementary sequences, the quantity of which is pro-
portional to their concentrations. After hybridization, the
amount of bound labeled cDNA on each spot is inferred
from the intensity of ﬂuorescence emitted when the spot
is stimulated with a laser light.

The output of the assay at each spot is the ratio of
cDNA concentrations in the two probes for each spotted
sequence, as the ﬂuorescent intensities are not calibrated
to absolute amounts of DNA. Once the cDNA probes have
been hybridized to the array and loose probes have been
washed off, the array is scanned to determine how much
of each probe is bound to each spot. The probes are tagged
with ﬂuorescent reporter molecules which emit detectable
light when stimulated by the laser. The emitted light is

captured by a detector (a CCD or a confocal microscope)
which records the light intensity. When the laser scans the
entire slide, a large array image containing thousands of
spots is produced. The spots occupy a small fraction of the
image area and they have to be individually located and
isolated from the image background prior to the estima-
tion of its mean intensity. The ﬂuorescent intensities for
each of the two dyes are measured separately, producing a
two-channel image. The image is false colored using red
and green for each image component, which represents
the light intensity emitted by the two ﬂuorescent dyes. So
the microarray images look like a collection of green, red
and yellow spots of different hue, saturation and intensity.
Spots whose mRNA’s are present at a high level in one or
the other cell population show up as predominantly red or
green. The intensities provided by the array image can be
quantiﬁed by measuring the average or integrated inten-
sities of the spots. The ratio of the ﬂuorescent intensities
for a spot is interpreted as the ratio of concentrations for
its corresponding mRNA in the two-cell populations.

The quantitative evaluation of microarray images is
a difﬁcult task.
The major sources of uncertainty in
spot ﬁnding and measuring the gene expression are vari-
able spot sizes and positions, variations in the image back-
ground and various image artifacts. Spots vary signiﬁ-
cantly in size and position within their vignettes, despite
the use of precise robotic tools to lay them out onto the

slide. Additionally, the natural ﬂuorescence of the glass
slide and non-speciﬁcally bounded DNA or dye molecules
add a substantial noise ﬂoor to the microarray image. To
make the task even more challenging, the microarrays are
also afﬂicted with discrete image artifacts such as highly
ﬂuorescent dust particles, unattached dye, salt deposits
from evaporated solvents, ﬁbers and various airborne de-
bris (Ajay et al., 2002; Bozinov and Rahnenführer, 2002;
Filkov et al., 2002; Hsiao et al., 2002).

In order to compare the performances of the ap-
plied ﬁltering schemes, we used a set of artiﬁcial images
(Fig. 7), and also natural microarray images (Fig. 12). Us-
ing the artiﬁcial images, we can also evaluate the objec-
tive restoration criteria, because the original, undistorted
images are available. In the case of the natural cDNA im-
ages, we can compare only the subjective results in the
form of a visual assessment of the ﬁlter outputs.

To evaluate the achieved results, objective criteria
such as the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean
square error (MSE), which reﬂect the signal-detail preser-
vation and the noise suppression respectively, were used.
As can be seen (Tables 3–5, Figs. 10 and 11) the pro-
posed method outperforms signiﬁcantly the commonly-
used multichannel noise reduction techniques. This is also
conﬁrmed by its performance on real images, (Figs. 13–
16), in which the noise component was successfully re-
moved while preserving the sharpness of the spot edges.

In this work a novel algorithm of noise reduction in mul-
tichannel images has been presented. Simulation results
reveal that this method outperforms the standard proce-
dures used for noise suppression in color images. The new
technique has been successfully applied to the denoising
of microarray cDNA images. During the ﬁltering process
the impulsive noise is being removed while the edges re-
main well preserved. The proposed technique can serve as
an efﬁcient low-processing tool for microarray image en-
hancement, which can facilitate better spots localization
and the estimation of their intensity.
