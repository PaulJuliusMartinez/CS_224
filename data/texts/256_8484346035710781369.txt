SUMMARY

In this paper, we measure the extent to which a biological marker is a surrogate endpoint for a clinical event by the proportional reduction in the regression coefficient for the treatment indicator due to the inclusion of the marker in the Cox regression model. We estimate this proportion by applying the partial likelihood function to two Cox models postulated on the same failure time variable. We show that the resultant estimator is asymptotically normal with a simple variance estimator. One can construct confidence intervals for the proportion by using the direct normal approximation to the point estimator or by using Fieller's theorem. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed methods are appropriate for practical use. We provide applications to HIV/AIDS clinical trials. 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION
The conventional approach to evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic agents is to conduct clinical trials with clinical endpoints that reflect tangible benefits to patients. Such endpoints include disease occurrence (for example, infection, cancer recurrence and heart attack) and death. Unfortunately, conventional clinical trials require hundreds of patients and take years to complete. Researchers and patients wish to assess the effectiveness of promising new agents as quickly as possible, which has led investigators to explore laboratory markers that may serve as `surrogate' endpoints in clinical trials. Replacement of a rare or late-occurring clinical endpoint with a frequent or short-term outcome variable can lead to substantial reduction in sample size and trial duration. On the other hand, inappropriate choice of (surrogate) endpoints has led to misleading results and improper treatment for large groups of patients.
For the treatment comparison based on a surrogate response variable to have an unequivocal implication for the corresponding true endpoint treatment comparison, a test of the null hypothesis of no treatment difference in the surrogate endpoint should also be a valid test of the corresponding null hypothesis based on the true endpoint (Prentice). This definition essentially requires the surrogate variable to capture any relationship between the treatment and the true

endpoint. In practice, such a restrictive condition is unlikely to be satisfied completely. A more realistic expectation is that the surrogate variable accounts for a substantial portion of the treatment effect on the clinical endpoint. This latter criterion has received considerable recent attention in HIV/AIDS research (Choi et al., O'Brien et al.).
In particular, Choi et al. reported that CD4 count and net CD4 per cent at week 16 explained, respectively, 46 per cent and 74 per cent of the zidovudine's effect on subsequent progression to AIDS in persons with asymptomatic HIV infection. (These numbers pertain to the proportional reduction in the regression coefficient for the treatment assignment under the proportional hazards model after controlling for changes in the CD4 levels.) The usefulness of these findings depends on the accuracy of the estimates. In this paper, we study the variability associated with such estimators. We demonstrate that, in many practical settings, the estimators are highly variable and the 95 per cent confidence intervals are very broad.
Our paper expands upon an important work by Freedman et al., which provides Fieller's confidence interval for the proportion of treatment effect explained by an intermediate endpoint in the setting of a binary outcome variable. The focus here is the failure time endpoint. The inclusion of the time dimension into the problem increases the technical complexity, but is of practical importance as most phase III clinical trials involve failure time rather than binary outcomes. Although we focus our attention on the failure time endpoint, much of the new development in this paper, including the adjustment for model misspecification and the construction of variance estimators and confidence intervals using the -method, applies to other endpoints.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we develop inference procedures for the proportion of treatment effect explained by a surrogate marker. In Section 3, we report the results of our simulation studies. In Section 4, we apply the proposed methods to several HIV/AIDS clinical trials. In Section 5, we discuss a number of related issues.

2. METHODS

Let R be the treatment indicator and ¼(t) a vector of possibly time-varying covariates that represent the history of the surrogate marker. We formulate the conditional hazard functions of the clinical event given R and +R, ¼(·), by the following two proportional hazards models.

Thus, it is unfeasible to construct a proper (1! )100 per cent confidence interval for p* using

The Prentice definition requires the surrogate marker to capture all the net treatment effect on

the clinical outcome, which corresponds to p*"1. Thus, the confidence interval for p* excluding

may consider a surrogate marker important if the lower limit of the 95 per cent confidence

of "1 and n"250, in which case an average of 37·5 events seems too small to produce stable L and K estimates. In general, the estimator pL is quite variable and the confidence intervals are broad. As mentioned previously, one cannot construct the 95 per cent confidence interval for p* using Fieller's theorem unless " L "/s.e^ .( L )'1·96. This condition failed in a few simulation samples when n"250. Fieller's method tends to produce wider intervals than the -method, though the
two methods have similar coverage probabilities. Further inspection of the simulation results (not
shown in Table II) reveals that, relative to the -method interval, Fieller's interval tends to be
shifted to the right and its width is more variable.

4. APPLICATIONS TO AIDS
The findings by Choi et al. mentioned in Section 1 were based on data from the ACTG (AIDS Clinical Trials Group) Protocol 019, which is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial on the efficacy of zidovudine in the treatment of asymptomatic HIV-infected persons (Volberding et al.). A total of 1075 patients were enrolled: 350 were given placebo and 725 were given one of two doses of zidovudine. After a maximum follow-up period of 90 weeks (median 55 weeks), 44 patients had progressed to AIDS -- 24 in the placebo group and 20 in the zidovudine groups. The two-sided p-value for the logrank test is 0·04.
Choi et al. assessed the extent to which different CD4 measures at week 16 were surrogate markers for the subsequent development of AIDS in patients who had not progressed by week 16. Excluded from this analysis were 5 placebo patients and 1 zidovudine patient who had developed AIDS by week 16 as well as 23 placebo patients and 84 zidovudine patients who had been censored. The CD4 measurements at week 16 were the most recently measured preceding values. The authors found that CD4 count and net CD4 per cent accounted for about 46 per cent and 74

per cent of the zidovudine effect. As shown in the left panel of Table III, the (estimated) standard errors are quite large for these two estimates. The -method confidence intervals cover the entire [0, 1] interval. It is not possible to construct Fieller's confidence intervals because the unadjusted treatment effect is not significant at the 5 per cent (or even 10 per cent) level.
In the above analysis, the patients on different treatment arms were not comparable due to the exclusion of those who had progressed to AIDS by week 16. It seems more meaningful to determine what proportions of the entire zidovudine effect on the progression to AIDS from the time of randomization are explained by the CD4 measures at week 16. This type of analysis uses the date of randomization as the time origin and includes all the events that occur after randomization, which is consistent with the original treatment comparison. The corresponding results appear in the right panel of Table III. The estimates for the proportions of zidovudine's effect explained by CD4 count and net CD4 per cent at week 16 are much smaller than those of the previous analysis. The upper limits of the -method confidence intervals are less than 1 while the lower limits are below 0. The Fieller intervals are quite unstable in this case because the unadjusted treatment effect is barely significant at the 5 per cent level. Using either type of analysis, one cannot reject, at the 5 per cent significance level, the null hypothesis that CD4 count (or net CD4 per cent) at week 16 explains none of the zidovudine effect on progression to AIDS.
For further illustration, we consider the BW (Burroughs Wellcome) Protocol 02 study which first demonstrated the clinical benefit of zidovudine in adults with symptomatic HIV infection (Fischl et al.). The study enrolled 281 patients, among whom 160 had AIDS and 121 had advanced AIDS-related complex. There were 144 patients assigned to the zidovudine group and 137 to the placebo group. The patients were followed for a minimum of 8 weeks. By the end of the trial, opportunistic infections had developed in 51 patients who received placebo, as compared with 25 who received zidovudine. To determine the extent to which CD4 count at week 8 was a surrogate endpoint for the time to opportunistic infection, we fit the two Cox models shown in Table IV. The observed value of pL is 0·283 with estimated standard error of 0·115. The 95 per cent confidence intervals are (0·057, 0·509) and (0·100, 0·666) based on the -method and Fieller's

theorem, respectively. We conclude that CD4 count at week 8 explained a small fraction of the zidovudine effect. Incidentally, several researchers (De Gruttola et al., Lin et al., Tsiatis et al.) have shown that the Prentice criterion for a surrogate endpoint was not met in the BW 02 study when the entire time-course of CD4 measurements was considered.
We have also applied the proposed methods to other HIV/AIDS clinical trials, including a placebo-controlled trial of zidovudine on mildly symptomatic HIV patients (ACTG Protocol 016) and a trial comparing zidovudine and ddI (ACTG Protocols 116b/117), and again found no evidence that CD4 measures explain a substantial fraction of the treatment effect (De Gruttola et al.). In fact, the estimate pL is very close to zero for the 016 study.

5. DISCUSSION

With great interest in determining the proper role of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials that

evaluate interventions in diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, there

has been much attention directed to the computation of p*, the proportion of the net treatment

effect explained by the surrogate marker. This paper provides a rigorous methodology for such

assessments. In particular, it enables the construction of confidence intervals for p* in the very

common setting in which the primary clinical endpoint is a failure time variable subject to

censorship. Simulations and applications to HIV/AIDS data reveal the high variability of

estimates of p*, while formulae presented here for their standard errors provide insights into the

conditions required for precise estimation of p*.

The theoretical results of Section 2 hold for other types of endpoints as well, though the forms

and CD4 counts, and used a bootstrap approach to calculate the 95 per cent confidence intervals. They did not explain how they performed the bootstrap, nor did they justify its validity. The asymptotic theory of pL developed in this paper is essential in establishing the validity of a bootstrap procedure. We concentrated on the analytic approach in this paper because there exists a simple expression for the variance of pL , which provides useful insights into the sources of variation in pL and the conditions required for precise estimation of p*, and which permits direct evaluation of several important quantities.
The variance formula is particularly useful in designing studies intended to investigate the degree to which a biological marker is surrogate for a clinical event. As our analytical and numerical studies have indicated, reasonably precise estimation of p* requires that a treatment effect on the development of the clinical event is much larger (relative to its standard error) than that needed to show a significant treatment effect on the clinical event, which implies the requirement of larger or/and longer trials or the use of meta-analyses.
The methods for estimating p* described in this report can provide valuable insights into mechanisms of disease and drug action. Interpretation of this quantity is not straightforward, however, even when it can be estimated with precision. Because disease processes are complex and because drugs have many mechanisms of action, validation of a surrogate marker must rely on an understanding of the underlying biology, not simply estimation of p*. A value of p* near 1 is not sufficient for inferring that the marker is a good surrogate for the clinical endpoint, since a variety of factors such as drug toxicity, non-compliance with study medications, and incomplete marker information can artificially raise this value to 1 (or greater) even for poor surrogates (De Gruttola et al.).
Nonetheless, the estimation of p* can be useful in providing evidence to evaluate hypotheses about mechanisms of drug action. For example, early in the AIDS epidemic, there was widespread belief that the CD4 count reflected both the principle mechanisms of the destruction of the immune system and of anti-HIV drug benefits. Although the p* associated with CD4 counts in antiviral drug trials could be near 1 even if this were not true, p* must be near 1 if it were true. The fact that a number of analyses demonstrated that the p* was nearer to 0 than 1 provided evidence that the CD4 count was not capturing all important drug effects. Although interpretation of values of p* near 1 is less straightforward than interpretation of p* near 0, values of p* near 1 for a given marker across many studies and across drugs with different mechanisms of action may help to support hypotheses about marker biological mechanisms.
