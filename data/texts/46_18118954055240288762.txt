1. Introduction
Molecular genetics has revolutionized approaches to the detection management, and possible cure, of inherited diseases. The discovery of ion channel gene defects, SCN5A on chromosome 3 and HERG on chromosome 7, that underlie specific forms of the long QT syndrome (LQTS) [1-3] represents a major achievement in the understanding and potential therapeutic management of this inherited cardiac arrhythmia because specific functional changes in ion channel properties have been identified. In addition to this work, mutations have also been identified in a gene, KVLQT1, which, at the time this paper is being written, has been suggested, but not yet proven, to encode yet another potassium ion channel [4]. Still another form of the disease, LQT4 has been linked to a fourth chromosomal location (4q25-27), and the identity of this mutant gene remains unknown [5]. These important achievements in molecular biology of the disease were made possible by integration of phenotypic data collected over the years by clinicians involved in management of LQTS patients and their families with the detailed knowledge of the relationship between the molecular structure and function of voltage-gated ion channels [6-8]. In this paper, we will review these recent findings, relate them to the basic electrophysiological parameters that are known to control the duration of the ventricular action potential, and discuss, in particular, promising recent results that suggest that improved pharmacological management of some forms of LQTS may already be emerging from this exciting work. Other aspects of the molecular genetics of LQTS have also

recently been reviewed and discussed in the literature [9,10].
2. The disease: genetic and functional heterogeneity
The familial form of LQTS is predominantly an autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with recurrent syncope and a propensity to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsade de pointes) and sudden death [6,7]. The disorder exists in so-called congenital and acquired forms. A prolonged repolarization duration of the QT interval has been used previously to identify affected individuals; however, evidence is accumulating that suggests that additional clinical phenotyping may be necessary to discern discrete forms of the disorder [11]. Recently, data have been presented indicating that significant differences in the electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern of repolarization were demonstrated in LQTS patients linked to chromosomes 3, 7, and 11112]. This observation suggests that other electrophysiological properties like QT dynamicity, heart rate variability, or T-wave alternans may have distinct patterns associated with different genotypes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying different forms of this disease will require integration of molecular genetic data with cellular electrophysiological information that can relate the clinical phenotype to change in ion channel structure, expression, and/or regulation caused by specific gene defects.
This progress in the molecular physiology of LQTS now allows a detailed investigation of the phenotypic pattern in the identified LQTS genotype, and further, it offers for the first time the prospect of developing a

molecular therapeutic approach to specific disease management based on the specific functional properties encoded by the inherited gene defects. The purpose of this brief review is to focus on the roles of dysfunctional ion channels in the congenital and acquired forms of LQTS and to indicate how the molecular information may be integrated into a new molecular therapeutic approach to the management of specific inherited arrhythmias.

3. Electrophysiological background: control of action potential duration

The plateau of the cardiac action potential is maintained by a fine balance of small inward and outward currents flowing through a large number of individual ionic pathways that include pumps, exchangers, and voltage-gated channels with unique kinetic and voltage-dependent properties [13]. Because of this fine balance and because the plateau period is one of very high input impedance, small changes in any ionic component can cause pronounced effects on the duration and wave form of the action potential plateau [14]. Consideration of the major ionic currents underlying this phase of cardiac electrical activity is thus a first step in considering the physiological importance of cellular mechanisms that can cause or contribute to LQTS.
Inward currents during the plateau flow through a small fraction of voltage-dependent Na + and Ca 2+ channels that fail to inactivate completely over the voltage-range and duration of the plateau. These currents have been referred to as ' window' currents because of the window of overlap between the voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation of the underlying channels [15-17]. In addition, inward current is also carried by the N a / C a exchange mechanism [18]; consequently, any molecular perturbations that promote additional inward exchange or ionic

current through mutant proteins will contribute to prolongation of the action potential plateau.
Outward plateau current, carried predominantly via potassium channels in the absence of [3-adrenergic stimulation, gradually increases over the time course of the plateau and begins the process of repolarization when net outward current exceeds inward current. Noble and Tsien [19] first identified time-dependent K + currents that contribute to the regulation of the cardiac action potential plateau. These currents are referred to as 'delayed rectifier currents' because they provide outward (rectifying) current that increases with a delay during the time course of the action potential plateau. Although it is now known that multiple types of K + channels contribute to cardiac electrical activity [20], delayed rectifier currents remain of considerable interest as key determinants of cardiac action potential duration and, as such, are considered potential targets for Class III antiarrhythmic drugs and have been prime candidates for both acquired and congenital forms of LQTS [1,21,22]. The two major cardiac delayed rectifier components are IKr, a rapidly activating and rectifying component that is blocked by the benzene sulfonamide antiarrhythmic drug E-4031 and by La +3 (Fig. 1) [23-25]; and IK~ which is lanthanum- and E-4031-insensitive and does not inactivate [25] (Fig. 2). /Ks, but not IKr, is increased by protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), and intracellular calcium in distinct temperature- and voltagedependent manners [26-32].

4. LQTS and the sympathetic nervous system
LQTS patients are particularly prone to develop serious ventricular arrhythmias under sympathetic activation. [3Adrenergic blockade has been found to improve clinical outcome of LQTS patients [6,7], but the electrophysiological mechanism of this protective action is still uncertain. The data from normal subjects [33], ischemic heart disease patients [34] and congestive heart failure patients [35] indicate that [3-blockers tend to increase parasympathetic modulation of the heart, improving sympatho-vagal balance altered during these disease processes. Channels that may be substrates for protein kinase A or C are thus of

particular interest in understanding the mechanistic basis of this disorder. These channels include the slow delayed potassium channel, L-type calcium channels and voltagegated sodium channels, as well as chloride channels that are activated by cAMP [36,37].
5. Molecular architecture of voltage-gated ion channels:
Molecular cloning has shown that the primary structures of voltage-gated Na +, Ca 2+, and K + channels share a common molecular template [8,38]. Summarized here is the principle molecular architecture of voltage-gated Na + and K + channels, because these two channel types have been shown to underlie two forms of LQTS. The primary structure of the principal tx-subunits of these channels is remarkably similar: 4 homologous membrane transmembrane domains each containing 6 membrane-spanning regions with a central pore region (Fig. 3). Each domain is a separate gene product for K + channels. Functional channels can be homo- or hetero-tetramers [39]. On the other hand, the primary channel forming tx or c~1 subunit of Na + and Ca2+ channels consists of the 4 membrane-spanning domains [8,38,40,41]. Channel-associated subunits exist for each channel type, but the functional roles of the subunits are still to be precisely determined [42-47], although modulatory roles are likely [48,49].

6. Voltage-gated potassium channels:
Potassium channels are membrane-spanning proteins that regulate potassium ion movement across the cell membrane and are important in maintaining the electrical activity in most excitable cells because they control cellular resting potential and action potential duration. Based on cellular electrophysiology and pharmacology, at least 7 cardiac K + channels have been identified [20]. Multiple subfamilies of voltage-dependent K + channels have now been cloned from heart based on sequence homology with the first K + channel to be cloned, the Shaker K + channel [50-56]. Expression cloning has also been reported both for inward rectifier K channels [57,58] and for the molecular basis of the ATP-regulated K channel(KATp) which has recently been shown to be reconstituted by co-expression of an inward rectifier K + channel subunit with the sulfonylurea receptor, SUR [59]. The clones for inward rectifier channel types show substantial homology with Shaker K + channels in the pore (H5 or P) region, but only limited similarities in other regions. Most notably, inward rectifier clones are smaller than Shaker K + channel clones and hydropathy plots suggest only 2, instead of 6, membranespanning regions. The ether-a-go-go (eag) gene was originally identified in Drosophila on the basis of a leg muscle phenotype [60] and confirmed as a K+channel based on functional expression in Xenopus oocytes. HERG, a gene in the Erg subfamily, has been isolated from human hip-

pocampus and shown to encode rapidly-activating and rectifying K + channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes [61,62] and to be expressed strongly in heart based on Northern blot analysis [1,2,62]. The lack of sequence homology of this gene with Shaker-type channels suggests that this gene encodes a separate class of K + channels and functional and pharmacological data now make it clear that I~. is encoded by this gene [2,63-65]. Additionally, a gene encoding a distinct slowly-activating, non-inactivating K + channel with a putative unique minimal molecular structure has also been cloned from cardiac tissue including human heart [66-69]. The protein encoded by this message contains 129-130 amino acids, only one membrane-spanning domain, no homology with other cloned voltage-gated K + channels and is referred to either as /Ks or minK. The functional properties of ionic current expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with, or human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) transfected with, minK message strongly resemble properties of the slowly-activated delayed rectifier potassium current (/Ks) that has been wellcharacterized in mammalian cardiac preparations [70,71]. Although it is clear that minK encodes a protein that is closely-associated with the putative IK~ channel, it is not clear yet whether the minK gene product forms functional channels [72-74] or channel-associated regulatory subunits or co-factors [75,76]. However, it is clear that the slow delayed rectifier current /Ks can be potently increased by sympathetic stimulation [77] and thus, because of the

interrelationship between sympathetic tone and exacerbation of LQTS symptoms [78], this channel may play an, as yet unidentified, key role in the disease.
7. Voltage-dependent Na + channels
Voltage-gated Na + channels are integral membrane proteins [41] that not only control the movement of Na + and underlie the spread of excitation in ventricular and atrial muscle cells and in the Purkinje fiber network throughout the heart [13], but also can contribute to the so-called 'window' inward current that prolongs action potential duration [17]. The voltage-gated Na + channel is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of c~ (33 kDa), [31 (36 kDa), and 6~_ (33 kDa) subunits [38,41,79], but only the oL-subunit is needed for expression of recombinant channels with voltage-dependent, kinetic, and pharmacological properties similar to native channels [80-82]. Cloning of the cardiac Na + channel oL-subunit isoform provided direct evidence that the distinct toxin sensitivity of cardiac channels was due to channel structure [83] that could be changed by mutagenesis [84]. Further mutagenesis studies revealed the close relationship between voltage-gated Na + and Ca 2+ channels when it was shown that key glutamate residues, common to all Na + isoforms, affected ion selectivity in such a manner that channel selectivity to Na + or Ca2+ was interchanged when these residues were altered [85]. Subsequent studies have indicated that a similar set of 4 glutamate residues, located in each of the 4 repeats of the calcium channel a l-subunit and apparently in the pore region, interact with divalent cations to determine Ca z+ channel selectivity [86,87], and the modulation of channel activity by dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists [88,89]. Thus detailed structural characteristics of the voltage-gated Na + channel have been and continue to be reported, and the information to date has provided detailed understanding of the molecular structures involved in channel gating and pharmacology. However, in order to apply this information to understanding the functional basis of different forms of LQTS, data were needed about the genomic message that encodes human heart Na + channels. The human cardiac sodium channel c~-subunit gene (SCN5A) was cloned and characterized by Gellens et al. [90] and mapped to chromosome 3p21 by George et al. [91]. Thus, in combination with the genetic linkage data of Jiang et al., [92] indicating correlation between LQTS and chromosome 3, SCN5A became a candidate gene for at least one form of the disease.
8. Relationship between channel structure and function: relevance to LQTS
In order to understand the underlying disease process that causes abnormal electrical activity in LQTS it is

necessary first to understand that any change in the balance of ionic currents that control the cardiac action potential plateau and are described above will markedly affect the duration of the action potential. The starting point in appreciating the complex nature of this problem is to first understand that any disease-related perturbation that reduces net outward current during the plateau period of the action potential will cause a phenotypical prolongation of the action potential. Thus a decrease in one or more potassium channel current or an increase in an inward pump or ion channel current could account for this phenotype and these changes could occur by changes in single channel conductance, voltage-dependent gating, or in channel gating kinetics. Further, these macroscopic properties could be caused by changes in the expression, regulation, or functional assembly of candidate ion channel proteins.
Thus the confirmation of a candidate gene as with a causal link to a specific form of LQTS seemed to be an almost impossible task, but the process was helped considerably by the data relating ion channel protein structure to channel function that has become available over the last 11 years since the first voltage-gated ion was cloned [93] and then functionally expressed [94]. Since this pioneering work, extensive structure-function studies have been carried out in heterologous expression systems that have provided a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of most functional properties of voltage-gated ion channels. These relationships have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [8,38,79,95], but properties that may be relevant to action potential prolongation are summarized here.
Because analysis of the primary structure of the Na + channel oL-subunit revealed that the fourth transmembrane segment ($4) in each of the 4 domains contained repeated motifs of positively charged residues, it was postulated that the $4 segment might serve as the key voltage-sensor that underlies channel activation [8,96]. Subsequent mutagenesis studies have shown that this is, in fact the case for both Na + [80] and K + [97-99] channels. Changes in charged residues in the $4 segments of both classes of channels change the relationship between activation and membrane potential consistent with predictions of changes in channel gating charge. These charged residues sense changes in membrane potential and underlie subsequent conformational changes in the channel protein that cause channels to make transitions from closed to open states.
In voltage-dependent Na + channels, inactivation, or spontaneous transition into a non-conducting state, follows activation and the voltage-dependence of the inactivation transition is a consequence of the voltage-dependent activation step [100,101]. Independent investigations using site-directed mutagenesis [80] and peptide-specific antibodies [102] have identified key Na + channel segments that contribute to channel inactivation. The cytoplasmic linker between repeats III and IV of the Na + channel a-subunit is a key structural component that contributes to channel

inactivation [80,102,103]. These studies together provide strong evidence that this cytoplasmic linker serves as the inactivation gate that occludes the Na + channel pore from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane during maintained depolarization. Modification of Na + channel inactivation could lead to enhanced maintained inward current which could contribute to action potential prolongation in LQTS (see below).
Changes in heart rate, contractile activity, and, to a certain extent, action potential duration are linked to wellknown stimulatory effects of [3-adrenergic agonists on L-type calcium channels, slow delayed rectifier channels, and C1- channels [36,104-106]. Modulation of the activity of these ionic channels indirectly will contribute to LQTSrelated electrical disturbances. However, there is evidence that the Na + channel itself may also be the target of protein kinase A and C, although the experimental evidence for modulation of this channel is not as well established as it is for other ion channels. Phosphorylation of a site (serine 1506) located on the intracellular loop between domains III and IV of the brain Na + channel ~ by protein kinase C slows inactivation [107,108] and conditions the brain channel protein for phosphorylation by protein kinase A at distinct regulatory sites [109], resulting in a decrease of recombinant channel activity [107]. Modulation of native cardiac Na + channel activity has also been demonstrated, including voltage-dependent changes in channel inactivation [110] and potentiation of current amplitude [111]. Thus inherited mutations that occur in the III-IV linker of the Na + channel may also affect modulatory activities of protein kinases that, in turn, could contribute to the exacerbation of LQTS arrhythmias by neurohormonal stimulation.

In contrast to the molecular basis of Na + channel inactivation, two types of K + channel inactivation have been revealed from site-directed mutagenesis experiments: N-type and C-type inactivation [112-115]. An inactivation particle is also responsible for fast (N-type) inactivation of K + channels by occlusion of the intracellular mouth of the channel. In this case, the amino-terminal segment of the K + channel is thought to act like a charged ball that is tethered on the end of a 'chain' of amino acid residues. Inactivation occurs as this charged, hydrophobic ball swings into and interacts with a receptor at the intracellular mouth of the channel as originally postulated by Armstrong [101]. C-type inactivation, a slower process than N-type inactivation, is thought to involve a conformation at the extracellular mouth of the channel pore [115]. Interactions between C-type and N-type inactivation are possible and any mutations that speed these processes or enhance the number of channels inactivated in the steady state at a fixed membrane potential would reduce net outward current and contribute to prolongation of the action potential in LQTS. Thus it is at least possible that inherited mutations of sodium channel and potassium channel inactivation could independently underlie different forms of this inherited disorder.
9. Genetic linkage and ion channels
The recent reporting of linkage of specific forms of LQTS with specific cardiac ion channel genes on chromosome 3p21-24 [3] and chromosome 7q35-36 [1,2] thus represents a major finding which resulted from a combined effort of molecular genetics and molecular physiology of ion channels [9]. In the case of both LQT-2 and LQT-3, a combination of genetic linkage and candidate gene approach was used to identify the genetic gene defects (Fig. 4). First, linkage analysis had established LQTS loci on chromosome 3p21-24 (LQT-3) and 7q35-36 (LQT-2) [92], but candidate genes were not discovered. Then, independent identification by Warmke and Ganetzky [61] of the localization of the gene encoding the human ether-ago-go-related gene (HERG) to chromosome 7 was key to identification of the molecular basis for LQT-2, and HERG was considered a candidate ion channel gene for this form of the genetic disorder. Several lines of evidence were presented that LQT-2 results as a consequence of mutations in the HERG gene including the demonstration that HERG is in fact expressed in heart, that intragenic deletions of HERG were associated with two families, and that 4 point mutations in HERG were discovered in LQT
patients. Importantly, the expression of HERG in Xenopus
oocytes showed that the functional properties of the HERG-encoded K + channel strongly resembled the properties of the rapidly-activating component of delayed recti-
fication in the heart, IKr [2] (Fig. 5). Thus, not surpris-
ingly, it was suggested that HERG mutations could under-

ported [2]. Each mutation causes either a reduction in the density of expressed K + channel current or the prevention of the assembly of a functional K + channel protein. Expressed currents thus do not have marked kinetic or biophysical changes, but the magnitude of outward current available for repolarization is thus reduced, and subsequently action potential duration and QT interval will be prolonged. Co-assembly of a mutant HERG channel with wild K + channel subunits would thus be expected to cause a reduction in the available repolarizing current in a dominant manner.
A similar approach was used to identify mutations in the sodium channel c~-subunit gene. In this case, because the human sodium channel ~-subunit had been previously

lie forms of congenital LQTS, but also that, because I~ is a target of Class III antiarrhythmic drugs, the same gene product may contribute to some acquired forms of the disorder.
In the initial study, functional properties of the mutant gene products were not reported and the wild-type channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes lacked methanesulfonanilide sensitivity [2], raising some concerns over the identity of IKr with H E R G and with explanations of how mutations in HERG might cause action potential prolongation and thus LQTS. Two recent reports have addressed both issues. First, it has been shown that HERG expressed in a mammalian cell line is, in fact, inhibited by dofetilide with an affinity (ECs0 = 12 nM) and kinetics very similar to native IKr channel activity [63]. Second, Sanguinetti et al. [65] have reported the functional consequences of the LQT2 mutations in HERG that had been previously re-

mapped to chromosome 3p21191], Wang et al. [3] chose this as the candidate gene for LQT-3. Here, because of previous in vitro work with recombinant Na + channels [80,102], selected regions of the gene could be identified based on known functional roles and then were chosen for PCR amplification. This approach revealed a mutation in SCN5A that causes a deletion of 3 amino acids in the cytoplasmic linker region between the third and fourth domains of the sodium channel o~-subunit protein, previously identified in heterologous expression systems as a key structural component of channel inactivation [80,102,103]. Thus a potential role of sodium channel abnormality caused by the SCN5A gene mutation in the LQTS etiology was suggested: modification of inactivation gating. This hypothesis was supported by experimental evidence in which a non-inactivating component of sodium channel current was identified at the single channel level in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA encoding wildtype and LQT-3 mutant sodium channels [116] (Fig. 6). A detailed understanding of the functional changes in the heart Na + channel that occur as a consequence of the LQT-3 mutation of SCN5A is now clearly possible, and this will be crucial to a mechanistic understanding of the disease and the development of new and specific therapies to treat it. In addition, it is likely that other mutations of SCN5A and/or other ion channel genes are likely to be discovered, and the mechanistic understanding of these gene defects will lead to additional insights into genetic origins of cardiac arrhythmias.
Finally, most recently, a positional cloning approach was used to establish KVLQT1, a newly-discovered gene that very likely encodes yet another K + channel [4]. In this work, linkage was first established between LQT1 and markers on chromosome 11, the chromosome previously linked to this form of LQTS [117]. Candidate genes were then tested by performing exon amplification, and a novel candidate gene was revealed based on sequence similarity to K÷ channel pores. Although at the time that this paper is being written, a full-length clone and functional expression have not yet been reported, it seems highly probable that KVLQT1 encodes a novel K ÷ channel protein.
10. Molecular pharmacology of LQTS: improved therapeutic approaches to disease management
10.1. SCN5A mutations
The precise identification of genetic defects of ion channels that cause different forms of LQTS opens up the possibility of discovering new therapeutic approaches to the management of these disorders based on the molecular pharmacology of the mutant ion channels encoded by the specific gene defects. Because it is possible to investigate the functional properties of the mutant genes using heterologous expression systems, in vitro tests can be carried out to identify unique drug-channel interactions that may oc-

cur as a consequence of the interrupted gene defect and that may be exploited to devise novel clinical approaches to disease management. This possibility is discussed in terms of voltage-gated Na ÷ channels and HERG channels.
Class Ib local anesthetics, such as lidocaine and mexiletine, are drugs that block Na ÷ channels in a voltage-dependent manner to inhibit ion flow through them. Channel block depends on the state of the channel in a complex manner, being influenced by the relative number of resting, open, and/or inactivated channels and the time course of inter-state transitions [118-120]. Local anesthetics bind to a site within the channel pore, accessible only from the intracellular side of the cell [121,122], and enhanced drug activity is associated with the inactivated state of the Na ÷ channel [123,124]. Molecular cloning and analysis of recombinant ion channels has identified the local anesthetic binding site and confirmed the intimate relationship between drug action and channel inactivation. In particular, one region of the Na + channel protein--transmembrane segment IVS6 of the e~-subunit--has been shown to be critical for both fast inactivation of the channel and local anesthetic binding [125,126]. Because the Na ÷ channel deletion mutation that underlies LQT-3 has been shown to modify inactivation of mutant channels [116], it is very likely that mutant Na ÷ channels will be modified in a unique manner by local anesthetic drugs.
There have already been reports indicating that such a strategy may in fact be possible. Experiments have been carried out in transfected human embryonic kidney cells [127] and mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes [128,144,145], and, in both cases, maintained Na ÷ current through noninactivating mutant channels was more sensitive to local anesthetic block than peak inward current. This suggests that Na ÷ channel current that underlies impulse conduction (peak curren0 will be less sensitive to Class Ib drugs than current that underlies QT prolongation in carriers of LQT3 gene mutations. This prediction, based on the pharmacology of recombinant wild-type and mutant Na ÷ channels has also been reinforced in preliminary clinical pharmacological studies. In this work, it has been shown that the Class Ib agent mexiletine effectively shortens the QT interval of patients identified as carriers of the LQT-3 SCN5A gene mutation [129]. These exciting preliminary studies, of course, await confirmation and detailed investigation, but, taken together, they strongly suggest that new therapeutic approaches to management of LQT-3 will emerge as a consequence of the studies of the unique pharmacology conferred on mutant channels by the genetic disorder.
10.2. HERG mutations
As discussed above, recent functional data reported for HERG mutations that cause LQT-2 have not revealed any channel abnormalities to date that would suggest unique drug-channel interactions for mutant vs. wild-type channel activity [65]. However, this is clearly a very early stage in

the development of a pharmacology directed at LQT2 mutant HERG channels, and additional experimental work is needed on recombinant channel activity before this possibility can be ruled out.

has been investigated as a potential Class III antiarrhythmic agent, based in part on its inhibition of IK~, [140,141], interacts with wild-type and mutant channels in the same or distinctly different manners.

11. Implications for acquired LQTS
Pharmacological agents that prolong the cardiac action potential can be antiarrhythmic by preventing premature excitation of the ventricle, but also proarrhythmic by promoting torsade de pointes or excessive QT prolongation in some patients. The latter drug action is referred to as 'acquired LQTS' because it is acquired as a function of drug treatment. Agents that block K + channels in general [130,131], and selectively block the rapidly-activating component of cardiac delayed rectifier K + channel current (I~) in particular, have been associated with acquired LQTS [132,133]. The fact that only segments of the population are at risk for acquired LQTS suggest a genetic predisposition toward excessive drug response, and the link to a genetic defect in the gene encoding I~ was specifically suggested by Sanguinetti et al. [2] who first reported the functional expression of HERG and showed that it is the gene that encodes cardiac IKr.
Although work to date clearly shows the importance of HERG to both congenital and acquired forms of LQTS, other channels may also be involved, particularly in the acquired form of the disorder. Although antiarrhythmic drugs remain the first and most frequently used approach to manage cardiac arrhythmias, it has long been recognized that there are significant risks associated with this therapy. Perhaps the most difficult side-effect of drug therapy to predict is the so-called 'idiosyncratic' reaction to drug doses. Here, otherwise normal patients may have a toxic reaction to a drug that can, by itself, result in lethal arrhythmias [134-136]. It is entirely possible that mutations in message other than SNC5A or HERG may encode cardiac ion channels that are not dysfunctional by themselves, but interact differently with particular antiarrhythmic drugs in a manner distinct from drug interactions with normal, or wild-type, channels. In fact, this possibility has been raised recently by Wei et al. [137] who have studied patients that exhibited acquired LQT phenotypes: excessive drug-induced QT prolongation or the occurrence of torsade de pointes. Interestingly, in this preliminary study, previously-identified mutations in SCN5A and HERG were excluded as underlying this form of acquired LQTS. Thus it might be possible that multiple forms of acquired LQTS can exist depending on candidate ion channels and specific drugs. A possible ion channel candidate that has already emerged is the minK channel which is an integral part of the protein that forms /Ks channels [138]. A polymorphism in the minK gene cloned from human leukocyte DNA has recently been reported [139]. It will be of interest to determine whether nor not drugs such as NE-10064, which

12. Future directions
The discovery of the ion channel gene defects that cause two forms of LQTS represents a major advancement in medicine. Because of the multifactorial nature of this disorder and the close interrelationship between ion channel control of cardiac electrical impulses and modulation of this control by neural-humoral factors, it is very likely that other gene defects and/or factors that control expression and translation of genes will be found to be causally related to other forms of this disorder [146]. Future studies of other candidate genes that may underlie acquired forms of the disorder are also very likely to yield additional and new information. Clearly the powerful combination of molecular genetics with detailed studies of the structure and function of recombinant ion channels not only will continue to provide insight into the mechanistic factors that cause the clinical phenotypes of this and other inherited diseases, but also offers the possibility of developing specific therapeutic approaches to disease management that will be based on the specific functional properties of the mutant gene products that can be studied precisely as the cellular electrophysiology of recombinant ion channels.
