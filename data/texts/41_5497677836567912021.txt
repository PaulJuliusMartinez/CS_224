ABSTRACT

In this paper we develop a complete classiÔ¨Åcation scheme
for planar, spherical and spatial four-bar linkages. The goal of
this classiÔ¨Åcation is to note all of the subtleties of motion that
an arbitrary set of four link lengths can deÔ¨Åne. A classiÔ¨Åcation
should exist only between the mechanisms that exhibit similar
ranges of motion at both the input and output. In the planar case,
three parameters being identiÔ¨Åed as either positive, negative, or
zero are necessary to completely characterize all possible ranges
of motion. In the spherical and spatial cases, four parameters be-
ing identiÔ¨Åed as positive, negative or zero are needed. The result
is 27 classiÔ¨Åcations of planar mechanisms and 81 for spherical
and spatial RCCC mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

The synthesis and analysis of planar four-bar mechanisms
via software utilizing interactive graphics is a practice that has
now existed for thirty years. A few of the programs developed
for this purpose include KINSYN (Kaufman, 1978), RECSYN
(Chuang et al., 1981) and LINCAGES (Erdman and Gustafson,
1977). For the synthesis and analysis of spherical four-bar mech-
anisms, Larochelle et al. (1993) have developed SPHINX. Of partic-
ular use in the analysis of a mechanism is the animation of that
mechanism through some appropriate range of motion. One pos-

sible range is all motions achievable by a given mechanism.

ClassiÔ¨Åcation schemes for planar four-bar mechanisms can
be found in almost any text on the subject of machine theory.
For example, see Erdman and Sandor (1997) or Norton (1992).
The gross classiÔ¨Åcation of a mechanism is Grashof (having a
fully rotatable link) or non-Grashof and then it is further cate-
gorized with the familiar titles of crank-rocker, Grashof double-
rocker, drag link and the likes. Proofs of the Grashof criterion
can be found in Williams and Reinholtz (1986), Paul (1979),
and the extension to spatial RSSR four-bar linkages in Kazer-
ounian and Solecki (1993). For most planar mechanism anal-
ysis, these standard classiÔ¨Åcation methods are ideal. Although
a mechanism‚Äôs classiÔ¨Åcation is not always necessary for its an-
imation over some range of motion, the classiÔ¨Åcation helps to
expedite the determination of the range and, occasionally, can be
necessary. The necessity for a thorough classiÔ¨Åcation scheme
for mechanisms arises when the mechanism is classiÔ¨Åed as a
‚Äúchange-point mechanism‚Äù, or lying in the region that separates
Grashof mechanisms from those that are non-Grashof. There ex-
ists a diverse array of these change-point mechanisms to be dif-
ferentiated amongst. In addition, mechanisms of this type are
commonly encountered when performing solution rectiÔ¨Åcation
on large sets of candidate mechanisms. For example, SPHINX gener-
ates a discrete representation of the ¬• 2 spherical four-bar mecha-
nisms which will guide a moving body through four orientations
in space. This discretized solution space is presented to the user
as a linkage type map (Ruth and McCarthy, 1997 and Murray and

McCarthy, 1995). The linkage type map color codes each solu-
tion according to its mechanism type and at the boundaries of the
familiar mechanism types these change-point mechanisms must
occur.

Spherical mechanisms admit a classiÔ¨Åcation scheme simi-
lar to that of planar mechanisms (see Duffy, 1980 and Chiang,
1988). In addition, Grashof‚Äôs law holds in a modiÔ¨Åed form for
the spherical case. The primary utility of these schemes for the
spherical case is to draw a comparison with their planar counter-
parts to allow the use of intuition developed about planar four-
bars.

The scheme developed here, at least for the planar case,
deÔ¨Ånes parameters similar to those determined by Bottema and
Roth (1979) for classiÔ¨Åcation of the image curves of planar four-
bar motion. Two works of note that seek more complete identi-
Ô¨Åcations of the sets of all four-bars are Barker‚Äôs (1985) compre-
hensive classiÔ¨Åcation of planar four-bar mechanisms and Savage
and Hall‚Äôs (1970) similar treatment of spherical four-bars (in-
cluding a discussion by Soni).

PLANAR MECHANISM ANALYSIS

Consider the planar mechanism shown in Fig. 1 The rela-
tionship between the input angle Q of the driving link to the out-
put angle Y

of the output link is

Q  = arctan B

A arccos

C

where

Figure 1. A PLANAR FOUR-BAR MECHANISM

These equations are the familiar cosine laws deÔ¨Åning the angle Q
at the limits to the mechanism‚Äôs range of motion. These limiting
angles exist if (cid:0)1  C1;C2  1. There are three cases:
1. Neither of the limiting angles Q
2. Only one of the two angles exists: a) if it is Q

means the input link fully rotates;

i;i = 1;2 exists, which

1 then the input
link rocks through the angle Q = p between Q
1, and, b) if
2 exists then the input link rocks through the angle Q = 0
between Q
1 and Q
through either 0 or p

3. Both angles exist, which means the input link rocks between
2 and does not pass

2;

1 and (cid:0)Q

The Input Link

The root C1 determines the smallest positive angle the driv-

ing link can reach. The link can reach Q = 0 if

Note that the arctan() function in Eq. 1 must identify angles on
all four quadrants to be accurate.

The argument of the arccosine term in Eq. 1 must be in the

range -1 to +1 for a solution to exist. Therefore, AQ 2 +BQ 2(cid:0)
CQ 2  0, and this relation deÔ¨Ånes the range of the angular
movement of the input link. Expanding the inequality yields a
quadratic equation in cosQ

that has two roots.

ment of the driving link:

2. The driving link rocks through Q = 0: T1T2  0 and T3  0;
3. The driving link rocks through Q = p : T1T2  0 and T3  0;

and

4. The driving link rocks over two ranges neither of which in-

cludes 0 or p : T1T2  0 and T3  0.

The Output Link

The limiting values of cosY

associated with the output link

of a planar mechanism are given by:

C3 =

h + a2(cid:0) g2 + b2

2bg

C4 =

h(cid:0) a2(cid:0) g2 + b2

The condition that the output link pass through Y = 0 is obtained
from C3 as

Using the parameters

g(cid:0) b + h(cid:0) a = T1 and g(cid:0) b(cid:0) h + a = (cid:0)T3;

(18)

if T1T3  0 then the link passes through p

, otherwise it does not.
The result is that the same parameters, Ti;i = 1;2;3 char-
acterize the movement of the output link, and we have the four
cases:
1. The output link fully rotates: T2  0 and T1T3  0;
2. The output link rocks through Y = 0: T2  0 T1T3  0;
3. The output link rocks through Y = p : T2  0 and T1T3  0;
4. The output link rocks over two ranges: T2  0 and T1T3  0.

and

PLANAR MECHANISM CLASSIFICATION

The three parameters Ti;i = 1;2;3 classify the movement of
the driving and output links of a 4R linkage into eight basic types.
If a conÔ¨Åguration exists such that all four joints of a pla-
nar linkage lie on a line the mechanism is said to ‚Äúfold.‚Äù If
one (or more) of the characteristics Ti;i = 1;2;3 is zero, then
the mechanism is a foldable linkage. If we consider the parame-
ters Ti;i = 1;2;3 can take the values +;0;(cid:0), then there are 27
classiÔ¨Åcations of planar 4R linkages, 19 of which fold. The num-
ber of parameters Ti that are zero equals the number of folding
conÔ¨Ågurations of the linkage.

Grashof‚Äôs Condition

Grashof‚Äôs condition states that one of the links in a mech-
anism can fully rotate if the sum of the lengths of the longest
and shortest links is less than (or equal to) the sum of the

lengths of the two intermediate links. The classiÔ¨Åcation pre-
sented here leads to an alternate expression for Grashof‚Äôs condi-
tion. Note from Table 1 that the mechanism contains a fully ro-
tatable link(and is not a change-point mechanism) if T1T2T3  0.
This quantity is a function of the link lengths a;b;g and h where
the identiÔ¨Åcation of the longest and shortest links is unnecessary
to determine whether or not the mechanism contains a fully ro-
tatable link.
An Example

Consider a mechanism A with link lengths fa;b;g;hg =
f1;3;5;3g and a mechanism B with fa;b;g;hg = f3;4;3;2g.
The associated parameters are, for mechanism A, fT1;T2;T3g =
f4;4;0g and, for B, fT1;T2;T3g = f(cid:0)2;2;0g. Both mechanisms
are readily classiÔ¨Åed as simple folding four-bars. In fact, both
fold (all of the pivots become colinear) at the location where the
input angle Q = p
. This is where the similarities end, however,
with the input link on mechanism A being fully rotatable and the
input link on B rocking through Q = p
. An extension of Table
1 to include all 27 cases could be used to rapidly identify this,
noting that any f+; +;0g mechanism has a fully rotatable input
crank and any f(cid:0); +;0g mechanism‚Äôs input link rocks through Q
= p

.

SPHERICAL MECHANISM ANALYSIS

between the input angle Q of the driving link to the output angle

of the output link is

The argument of the arccosine term in Eq. 19 must be in
the range -1 to +1 for a solution to exist. Therefore, AQ 2 +
BQ 2 (cid:0) CQ 2  0, and this relation deÔ¨Ånes the range of the
angular movement of the input link. Expanding the inequality
yields a quadratic equation in cosQ

that has two roots

These equations are the spherical cosine laws deÔ¨Åning the angle

if (cid:0)1  C1;C2  1. There are three cases:
1. Neither of the limiting angles Q

4. The output link rocks over two ranges: T2T4  0 and T1T3 

SPHERICAL MECHANISM CLASSIFICATION

The four parameters Ti;i = 1;2;3;4 classify the movement of
the driving and output links of a 4R linkage into two sets of eight
basic types denoted by those with T4  0 and those with T4  0.
The eight spherical mechanisms with positive T4 have the same
properties as the planar 4R mechanisms with the same linkage
type. The linkages with T4  0 have link lengths that add up to
greater than 2p and wrap around the sphere. The characteristics
T1, T2, and T3 for a linkage with T4  0 are the negation of these
characteristics for the same type of linkage with T4  0. Thus two
spherical linkages, each with the negative set of characteristics of
the other, will have the same overall movement of the input and
output links.

If a conÔ¨Åguration exists such that all four joints of a spheri-
cal linkage lie on a plane the mechanism is said to ‚Äúfold.‚Äù If one
(or more) of the characteristics Ti;i = 1;2;3;4 is zero, then the
mechanism is a foldable linkage. If we consider the parameters
Ti;i = 1;2;3;4 can take the values +;0;(cid:0), then there are 81
classiÔ¨Åcations of spherical 4R linkages, 65 of which fold. The
number of parameters Ti that are zero equals the number of fold-
ing conÔ¨Ågurations of the linkage.

Grashof‚Äôs Condition

For any given set of four link lengths deÔ¨Åning a spherical
mechanism, changing any two of the link lengths to their sup-
plements deÔ¨Ånes a mechanism capable of the same motion. To
apply Grashof‚Äôs condition to spherical four-bar mechanisms, this
rule must be applied to the link lengths to determine the set with
the shortest total length. Grashof‚Äôs condition can now be ex-
tended to the sphere: one of the links in a spherical mechanism

fully rotates if the sum of the lengths of the longest and short-
est links is less than (or equal to) the sum of the lengths of the
two intermediate links. The classiÔ¨Åcation presented here leads
to an alternate expression for this condition. Note from Table 2
that a spherical mechanism contains a fully rotatable link(and is
not a change-point mechanism) if T1T2T3T4  0. This quantity is
a function of the link lengths a
;g and h where the identiÔ¨Åca-
tion of the longest and shortest links is unnecessary to determine
whether or not the mechanism contains a fully rotatable link.

SPATIAL MECHANISM ANALYSIS

Consider the spatial RCCC mechanism shown in Fig. 3
where the rotation of the revolute joint is considered the input to
this linkage. Associated with each RCCC mechanism is a spher-
ical image. The spherical image is a spherical four-bar mech-
anism with link lengths equal to the angular twist of the links
of the RCCC mechanism, see Duffy (1980). Hence, by having
previously developed a classiÔ¨Åcation for spherical 4R linkages
we can now classify spatial linkages. We classify spatial RCCC
mechanisms according to the linkage type of their corresponding
spherical image.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have developed a complete classiÔ¨Åcation
scheme for planar and spherical 4R linkages. Moreover, we clas-
sify spatial RCCC linkages according to their associated spher-
ical image. The goal of this classiÔ¨Åcation is to note all of the
subtleties of motion that an arbitrary set of four link lengths can
deÔ¨Åne. The result is 27 unique classiÔ¨Åcations of planar mecha-
nisms and 81 for spherical and spatial mechanisms.
