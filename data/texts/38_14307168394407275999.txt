On July 12 and 13, 1980, the biennial meeting of Computer Science Department Chairmen was held at Snowbird, Utah. This meeting, which is organized by the Computer Science Board (CSB), is a forum for the heads of the 83 d e p a r t m e n t s in the United S t a t e s and C a n a d a that grant Ph.D.s in Computer Science. T h e meeting was attended by 56 department heads or their representatives, and by six observers from industry and government. This report was developed during the meeting as a result of intensive discussions about the crisis in C o m p u t e r Science. This report was endorsed by the entire assembly.

SUMMARY
T h e r e is a severe m a n p o w e r shortage in the c o m p u t i n g field. It is most acute at the P h . D . level: the supply of new Ph.D.s is about 20 percent of the d e m a n d . T h e crisis has been precipitated by explosive growth of the computing field with no matching growth of university budgets in Computer Science. Unless the trend reverses, the country will soon lose its lead in computer technology because enough computer experts cannot be trained and because the basic research to ensure a continuing supply of new concepts for the long term future cannot be conducted. Some of the symptoms of the crisis:f
· A b o u t 250 new Ph.D.s g r a d u a t e d in 1979 ( c o m p a r e d with 256 in 1975) as compared with 1300 positions seeking Ph.D.s.
·Fewer than 100 new Ph.D.s sought academic positions as compared with over 650 academic positions known to be open.
· U n d e r g r a d u a t e enrollments doubled since 1975 with only nominal increase in lab space and faculty size over the same period. ·Intense competition for computer specialists has produced record salaries: new M.S. degree holders get offers matching full-year academic salaries for new Ph.D.s; experienced assistant professors get industrial oi'icrs as high as S 4 5 K .
t Some of these data are taken from "Production and Employment of Ph.D.s in Computer Science 1977 and 1978," O. Taulbee and S. Conte, Communications of (he ACM, February 1979, pages 75fT. and from update reports circulated among department chairmen by Taulbee and Conte since then. The remaining data were collected by surveying the department chairmen who were assembled at the Snowbird meeting.

To generate a greater supply of new faculty and other researchers, the pool of students in Ph.D. programs must be enlarged and quality improved. The department heads unanimously agreed that the required environment should comprise:
·Computing facilities capable of sustaining experimental research. (An appendix to this report shows that this requires a capital investment, per researcher, of S30K for good facilities to S75K for advanced facilities.)
·More time for faculty to supervise graduate students in research.
·Increased support for graduate research assistants.
The following report elaborates these points.
INTRODUCTION
T h e r e is a severe m a n p o w e r crisis in C o m p u t e r Science. There are acute shortages of well trained computer people at all levels, especially the Ph.D. level. The Ph.D. shortage is especially serious b e c a u s e it t h r e a t e n s o u r ability to conduct basic research in Computer Science and to train the next generation of computer experts. Some of the symptoms manifested among the 83 Ph.D.granting C o m p u t e r Science Departments in the United States and Canada are:
·The total number of Ph.D. Computer Science faculty in the United States increased from 805 in 1975 to 837 in 1979. T h e net gain, 32, is 2.8 percent of the total of 1130 Ph.D.s graduated in the same period. Most faculty outflux is into industry, not r e t i r e m e n t .
·The total number of Ph.D. graduates, the next generation of researchers and teachers, has decreased from 256 in 1975 to 248 in 1979. ·In 1979, there were 1300 jobs advertised for these 248 Ph.D.s.
·In 1979, fewer than 100 of these Ph.D.s chose academic careers, and they had over 650 academic positions from which to choose. ·Undergraduate enrollments have doubled since 1975, while faculty size and lab space have remained nearly fixed.
·Classes sizes are significantly higher than in other science departments. ·Experimental facilities in most departments are obsolescent and inferior to industrial facilities.
This situation seriously threatens the ability of Computer Science departments to continue developing the skilled people needed both by our information processing ind u s t r y a n d by a n i n c r e a s i n g l y t e c h n o l o g i c a l society. It threatens our ability to ensure, through basic research, a continuing supply of new concepts for the long-term future. It t h r e a t e n s o u r ability to m a i n t a i n the q u a l i t y of our academic programs.

growth of the computing industry--the "computer revolution" since 1975, a period in which there has been almost no growth in C o m p u t e r Science laboratory facilities or in the n u m b e r of C o m p u t e r Science faculty.
Experimental science is expensive. Although m a n y Computer Science departments have long recognized the need to strengthen their experimental facilities, the required resources have not been available. The physical p l a n t h a s b e e n frozen as it w a s in a n e r a w h e n c o m p u t i n g was much less important: budgets are not growing beyond inflation because the total pool of college-age students is a p p a r e n t l y not growing. S o m e help is now beginning to appear from the federal agencies and from industry, but m u c h m o r e is needed.
Sixty percent of our Ph.D.s take careers in industry. Bachelor's degree holders get starting industrial salaries averaging $20K, Master's S26K, and Ph.D.s S32K; academic annual salaries for new Ph.D.s with s u m m e r support come to about S27K. High industrial salaries lure qualified students from graduate school, thereby depleting the pool entering the pipeline and guaranteeing that the shortages will persist. Aware of excellent career opportunities, undergraduates come in droves to our departments. Eager for researchers, industry actively recputs our faculty. Someone has said: We are eating our seed corn.
A s m a l l s h o r t a g e in a n e x p a n d i n g field w o u l d b e h e a l t h y . But a r a t i o of 1:5 in s u p p l y to d e m a n d for P h . D . s is not healthy. T h e C o m p u t e r Science crisis results from dynamic technology pulling on static universities. Some Federal agencies (e.g., NSF, D A R P A , and O N R ) are now allocating additional resources to experimental C o m p u t e r S c i e n c e . W e b e l i e v e t h i s to b e a c r u c i a l first step. Universities have been vexingly slow in reallocating resources. Much instructional computing still relies on punched cards; many students experience long lines for terminals and keypunches. Most Computer Science departments are seriously cramped for space. Although industry has benefited from the research and training p r o v i d e d by a c a d e m i c C o m p u t e r Science, it h a s not, w ith s o m e n o t a b l e e x c e p t i o n s , p r o v i d e d financial s u p p o r t . Someone has said: We are killing the goose that laid the golden egg.
Students are enrolling in record n u m b e r s in o u r undergraduate programs. While many are attracted to C o m p u t e r Science by its excellent careers, a growing n u m b e r is being encouraged by the " c o m p u t e r revolution"1 to take introductory and intermediate programming courses in order to be familiar with the c o m p u t e r as a tool in other disciplines. T h e result? Existing terminal facilities and computing centers cannot handle the load. Class sizes balloon. Lab facilities are insufficient. Eaculty consider industrial positions.
The next section describes the nature of Computer Science. Subsequent sections present our recommendations, which we believe will improve the national research environment and ensure a supply of computer experts during the next decade and beyond.

The Nature of Computer Science
University Computer Science research provides the base of knowledge for the nation's information processing technology. Computer Science, called "informatics" in Europe, studies the representation, transformation, nature, and philosophy of information. It encompasses both theory and experiment.
Algorithms for processing information, the complexity of algorithms, the theory of computability, and models of information handling are parts of Computer Science. These parts have a strong mathematical tradition.
Applications of knowledge representation such as artificial intelligence, databases, graphics, image processing, robotics, and automation are parts of Computer Science.
The structure of machines and software systems to process information, algorithms and processes in such systems, and the functional relations among components of such systems are parts of Computer Science. Computer Science thus experiments with implementations and studies their efficiency. In areas such as Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) design and communications, Computer Science overlaps with Electrical Engineering and benefits from cooperative work.
Computer Science studies the processes of information flow and transformation that underlie many professions, such as medicine, economics, business, social sciences, physical sciences, life sciences, and engineering. Like m a t h e m a t i c s , it is an indispensable tool. It is a core science whose influence is spreading across all of society.
C o m p u t e r Science is both a theoretical a n d an experimental science. In this it is similar to the physical sciences. C o m p u t e r Science is also an indispensable tool in o t h e r disciplines. In this it is like the m a t h e m a t i c a l sciences.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Computer Science Department Environment
There are two steps which could significantly improve the environment in Computer Science departments. T h e first is better facilities for teaching and research. This includes not only local facilities, but also network connections to other Computer Science research facilities. T h e second step is relief from large-class teaching loads in order to permit adequate time for supervising graduate students and for research.
The capital investment in facilities per researcher can be put in three ranges. (A researcher is a faculty m e m b e r , a full-time Ph.D. student, or a member of the support staff.) F o r t h e p e r i o d 1 9 8 1 - 8 5 , t h e average d e p a r t m e n t requires capital investment per researcher in the range of $25K to $30K. The department that wants its research

to be at the frontier of Computer Science will require capital investment at a much higher level--about $55K to $75K per researcher. The department that chooses not to emphasize the experimental side of Computer Science can get by with a capital investment of about $10K to $15K per researcher. (Appendix 1 illustrates these calculations.) In each case, about 20 percent of that capital investment must be added to the department's budget for maintenance and support. The total national cost to properly capitalize Ph.D.-granting departments--at their current number of faculty and Ph.D. students--is estimated at about $55 to $80 million. (See Appendix 2.) Growth by 50 percent in the number of Ph.D. students raises the required investment to about $95 million.
Pressures on faculty are intense. In the United States, Ph.D. Computer Science faculty have grown from 805 in 1975 to 837 in 1979--virtually no growth. T h e undergraduate student demand for Computer Science has risen at 15 p e r c e n t t o 20 p e r c e n t a n n u a l l y d u r i n g t h e s a m e period.
Thus overburdened, faculty cannot find adequate time to conduct research or to supervise graduate students in research. This atmosphere is a strong incentive for research oriented faculty to seek positions in industrial r e s e a r c h g r o u p s . D e p a r t m e n t s m u s t find w a y s t o give faculty more time for exploring new ideas with their graduate students while continuing to fulfill teaching commitments. Limiting or cutting back enrollments would be counterproductive given the societal need manifested in the rising enrollments. The only way in the long term to meet this need is to train, hire, a n d retain new faculty.
Departments, universities, Federal agencies, and corporations all have roles in solving this problem. Departments must make hard choices within strained budgets t o find m o r e t i m e t o lessen t h e l a r g e - c l a s s t e a c h i n g burden on faculty and to allow them to supervise graduate students properly. A special commendation goes to the National Science Foundation for instituting the N e w Investigator Research Program to assist in this purpose. T h e g o v e r n m e n t a n d c o r p o r a t i o n s c a n p r o v i d e financial assistance through fellowships, traineeships, and programs to build up experimental facilities.
Universities must contribute a greater capital investment for experimental research, including adequate laboratory space as in other sciences, and must increase the size of the Computer Science faculty. In general, facilities and teaching positions must be allocated recognizing the i n h e r e n t l a b o r a t o r y n a t u r e o f t h e field, as t h e y a r e in t h e physical sciences and in engineering.
Students
In 1980, approximately 265 Ph.D. computer scientists graduated from colleges and universities in the United States; this number has hardly changed from 256 in 1975. M o r e t h a n 170 of this total were absorbed into

industry a n d government, leaving fewer than 100 for academia. Studies conducted by the Computer Science Board and others have revealed that colleges and universities seek 650 Ph.D. computer scientists to meet their present educational needs, and that industry and government seek an additional 650 Ph.D. computer scientists. T h e supply is about 20 percent of the d e m a n d . O u r inability to produce the needed Ph.D.s threatens our ability to conduct basic research and to train all other c o m p u t e r specialists. Increased p r o d u c t i o n of Ph.D.s is important.
M a n y of o u r institutions have observed a decline in the quality of students applying to the Ph.D. program: Industry skims off the cream before they enter graduate school. Increased quality of o u r Ph.D.s is essential.
The Computer Science department heads agreed that the environment for educating Ph.D.s should be the same as the environment in which the faculty conduct their research; this environment should contain facilities comparable to those in high-quality industrial research labs. Such an environment would be a significant factor in attracting and retaining talented graduate students a n d faculty alike. T h e facilities must have capacity sufficient to s u p p o r t all s t u d e n t r e s e a r c h . T h e faculty m u s t have time sufficient to supervise the students.
An a p p r o p r i a t e e x p e r i m e n t a l e n v i r o n m e n t is not the o n l y f a c t o r in a t t r a c t i n g a n d r e t a i n i n g s t u d e n t s ; financial s u p p o r t is also i m p o r t a n t . T h e r e is a c o n s e n s u s that each Ph.D. student should be supported by a combination of research and teaching funds at between one third and one half the starting salary of a new B.S. degree holder. (This starting salary in 1980 averaged about $20,000.) Although a few departments have stipends close to this, most need to m a k e adjustments to reflect recent rises in salaries.
T h e r e is a c o n s e n s u s that the pool of P h . D . s t u d e n t s can only be enlarged through an increased number of fellowships and traineeships with stipends sufficient to reduce the attraction of immediate industrial employment among B.S. recipients. (A $10,000 annual stipend may be required.) Both N S F and corporations can con tribute to this goal.
T h e r e is also a consensus that, to increase the pool of identifiable Ph.D. candidates, departments should increase their efforts to contact the best students in the undergraduate program. These students should be given special opportunities as research assistants to experience firsthand t h e e x c i t e m e n t o f r e s e a r c h .
Industry
The Computer Science department heads noted that relations between industry and academia have improved d u r i n g t h e p a s t five y e a r s . T h e y s u p p o r t e d t w o p r o p o s a l s for further improving the quality and quantity of industrial support for C o m p u t e r Science.

The Computer Science Board will act as a research clearinghouse to make more information available to industry about sponsored research under way in C o m puter Science departments.
Although there are many philanthropic grants to universities from major corporations, few of these have come to C o m p u t e r Science. In search of new funds to support students and more research time for faculty, the Computer Science Board will send a letter to major corporations. This letter will set forth the special problems of C o m p u t e r Science a n d a r g u e that it is in t h e best interests of these corporations to contribute to the solution. It will suggest t h a t n e w f u n d s be m a d e a v a i l a b l e as unrestricted grants to university Computer Science departments. The new monies requested would supplement specific research grants and other existing cooperative programs.

rapidly increasing undergraduate enrollments, decreas-

ing Ph.D. output, widening salary gap with industry, and

obsolescence of research facilities as prime reasons for

the problems of acquiring and retaining faculty. The net

effect is a reduction in the ability of universities to

Assuming that an average Ph.D. student spends four years in the Ph.D. program, an average of 1000 must be in the current pipeline to achieve a graduation rate of 250 per year. Counting 840 Ph.D. Computer Science faculty, we estimate 1840 university researchers. If each is capitalized at the average of $30K ( A p p e n d i x I), the total capital investment would be $55.2M.
For a different estimate, suppose that the top 200 faculty supervise 400 of the graduate students using frontier facilities capitalized at $70K per researcher: these 600 researchers require an investment of $42M. Capital-

izing the remaining 1240 researchers at the average of $3()K each requires an additional $37.2M. T h e total investment in this case is $79.2M.
T h e a b o v e figures s h o w t h e i n v e s t m e n t for t h e current n u m b e r of researchers. G r o w t h of 50 percent in the number of Ph.D. students would increase the required investment to about $95M.
These estimates assume that all researchers, including those engaged in theoretical work, will use the facilities. Experience at those institutions already having good facilities shows that this assumption is reasonable.
