This study focuses on the relationship between sport volunteerism and social capital, defined here as a resource that stems from participation in certain social networks. A position generator and a resources generator were used to measure the social capital of respondents. Results from this pilot study survey, exploring several aspects of volunteerism in sport in two Canadian communities (one in Québec, the other in Ontario), show a strong relationship between volunteerism in sport and social capital but do not allow a precise measure of the direction of this relationship. Results also show stronger relationships between sport volunteerism and social capital when we control for gender, language, and age.
Cette étude porte sur le bénévolat dans le sport et le capital social, définit ici comme une ressource émanant de la participation à divers réseaux sociaux. Un générateur de position et un générateur de ressources ont été utilisés pour mesurer le capital social des répondants. Les résultats de cette étude pilote par questionnaire, qui explore différents aspects du bénévolat dans le sport dans deux communautés au Canada (une au Québec, l'autre en Ontario), montrent une forte relation entre le bénévolat et le capital social, mais ne permettent pas une mesure précise de la direction de cette relation. Les résultats montrent également une forte relation entre le bénévolat dans le sport et le capital social quand on croise avec le genre, la langue, et l'âge.
Introduction
Despite increasing attention in recent years from scholars and policy makers, we know relatively little about the nature and dynamics of sport volunteerism in Canada. Much of the literature and national survey data refer to volunteerism in different sectors of Canadian social life but rarely to the specifics of volunteerism

in sport (Harvey et al., 2005). Such is the case with Statistics Canada's (2001) National Survey of Giving, Volunteering and Participating (NSGVP), in which results for volunteers in sport were regrouped into the wider category of arts, culture, and recreation volunteers. To our knowledge, only Sport England, so far, has conducted extensive surveys specific to sport volunteerism (see Leisure Industry Research Centre, 2003), and yet, volunteerism is the backbone of the Canadian sport system from the local to national to international levels.
According to Doherty (2005), sport volunteerism in Canada represents 18% of total volunteerism in Canada, an estimate that is slightly higher compared with 15% in England (Leisure Industry Research Centre, 2003, p. 7). This makes sport one of the major sectors of volunteerism in Canada. The Canadian Sport Policy (Sport Canada, 2002, p. 21) recognizes the importance of volunteerism to sport and underlines its central role in reaching the goal of "Enhanced Capacity" (in terms of the human and facility resources needed to increase participation in sport):
In pursuit of [the goal of Enhanced Capacity], the federal-provincial/territorial governments, in keeping with their level of responsibility, will . . . support the development of volunteer and salaried leadership and organizations at all levels to strengthen their contribution to a healthy and ethically based, athlete/participant-centered sport system. In the last 15 years, scholars and policy makers have also shown increased interest in social capital as a tool for public policy, although there is hardly any consensus on what social capital is and how it can be used as a tool for policy. There are several major approaches to, and definitions of, social capital (see the following section); however, for the purposes of this paper, social capital is defined "as a resource that stems from participation in certain social networks that possess specific characteristics which open up access to resources of varying value" (Lévesque, 2005, p. 5). Putnam's (1995) influential article introduced the idea that volunteerism in sport, as in other spheres of social life, contributes to the social capital of communities and, as a result, to the strength of democracies. In fact, although Putnam's views have sparked an explosion in the literature on social capital, relatively few publications exist on sport and social capital, let alone sport volunteerism and social capital. The goal of this article is to contribute to the emerging literature on sport and social capital and, more precisely, on the relationship between sport volunteerism and social capital. Various questions may be raised about the relationship between sport volunteerism and social capital. For example, does volunteerism in sport contribute to social capital, or does increased social capital foster increased volunteerism in sport? What social factors explain variations in the relationship between social capital and sport volunteerism? This paper draws on data from a pilot study realized in two local communities in Canada: one a predominantly French-speaking community in Québec, the other a predominantly English-speaking community in Ontario. Volunteers from both communities were surveyed, by mailed questionnaire, on several aspects of their experiences as sport volunteers including: time devoted to volunteerism; forms of volunteer involvement; reasons for volunteerism; benefits from volunteerism; training, support, and evaluation; challenges and obstacles; and social capital and citizenship. The specific objective of this article is to test different measures of social capital, inspired by the social-network tradition, in an attempt

208 Harvey, Lévesque, and Donnelly
to determine if such measures reveal a link between sport volunteerism and social capital. A second objective is to verify the extent to which social factors such as age, gender, and ethnicity explain variations in the link between sport volunteerism and social capital. To our knowledge, this study is the first to research the existence of a relationship between social capital and volunteer involvement in sport using tools from the social-network tradition.
Social Capital
What we know about sport and social capital is limited and fragmented, mainly because the existing literature reflects current debates about the definition of social capital, the contribution of sport to social capital, and what forms of social capital may be generated in the sphere of sport.
For Putnam, one of the leading figures in that field of research, social capital consists of "features of social organization, such as trust, norms, and networks, that can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordinated action" (Putnam, 1993, p. 167). In his book, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community (2000), Putnam argues that excessive individualism in the United States reduced civic engagement and participation in the electoral process, both of which are marks of declining social capital and that, in turn, undermine the efficacy of public institutions. For example, a decrease in the number of individuals participating in sport clubs and volunteerism would be a sign of a decline in social capital. Putnam distinguishes three forms of social capital: (1) bonding social capital, referring to relations within homogeneous groups, such as those among members of sport teams or clubs; (2) bridging social capital, referring to relations across horizontal social divisions, such as those across teams within a league; and (3) linking social capital, referring to ties between different social groups of society; for example, citizens from all social groups who are fans of their local professional football club (for more detailed definitions of these forms of social capital, see PRI, 2005).
Bourdieu describes social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to the possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition or, in other words, membership in a group" (1986, p. 249). Moreover, he adds that "the volume of social capital possessed by a given agent . . . depends on the size of network connections he can effectively mobilize and on the volume of the capital (economic, cultural or symbolic) possessed in his own right by each of those to whom he is connected" (1986, p. 249). In other words, social capital is unevenly distributed and dependent on the levels of resources one has access to within his or her network.
There are also diverse forms of network-based approaches to social capital. For example, Lin defines social capital as ". . . the resources embedded in social networks accessed by actors for actions" (2001, p. 25). As noted, building on the Bourdieu and Lin definitions, in this article social capital is defined "as a resource that stems from participation in certain social networks that possess specific characteristics which open up access to resources of varying value" (Lévesque, 2005, p. 5). Within the general social-network approach to social capital, some researchers are more interested in the networks themselves (the structure of relations

Sport Volunteerism and Social Capital 209
within the networks), while others focus on the relational aspects of the networks (the resources that are available and accessible). At this point, it is important to stress that if all the previously mentioned approaches refer to social networks as a main feature of social capital, they do not use that notion in the same way. While Putnam sees social networks as being sources of social trust and norms of reciprocity and providing the conditions conducive to a well-functioning society, for the other authors discussed here, social networks are no more or no less than vehicles of production, reproduction, and exchange of resources. They are truly a capital, similar and interconnected with economic, cultural, and other forms of capital (Bourdieu, 1986). Finally, all of the approaches to social capital outlined here underline that social capital is unevenly distributed in society according to class, age, gender, ethnicity, and race. This article focuses on age, gender, and language, more precisely in the last instance on differences between French and English as a spoken language, an important issue in Canada as an officially bilingual and multicultural country.
In network-based approaches to social capital, the dynamics of formation and development of social networks are fundamental to understanding the ways in which the specific characteristics of actors influence the formation of social capital. In other words the question is, do social networks have the same configuration according to the age, gender, or spoken language of the actors, the latter being considered here as a marker of community belonging (Omoto & Snyder, 2002)?
With regard to gender, the question is whether men and women participate in the same type of social networks. Several studies have shown that women have more limited access than men to prestige positions and to diversified networks in terms of professional occupations (Angelusz & Tardos, 2001; Lin, Fu, & Hsung, 2001). Moreover, women tend to become involved in different voluntary organizations than do men (Miller McPherson & Smith-Lovin, 1987) and to spend less time than do men with colleagues from the workplace (Harvey, Marshall, & Frederick, 1991). Finally, in a study using similar research instruments to this one, Erickson (2004) found significant differences between men and women in terms of social capital composition, notably with regard to diversity of contacts.
Age is another social characteristic that may influence the composition of social networks. From the point of view of the composition of social networks, age is also an indicator of the evolution of several forms of social relations (e.g., family, workplace; Wellman, Wong, Tindall, & Nazer, 1997; Burt, 1991). Current knowledge about the relationship between age and social capital indicates that results vary according to the types of measurement used. There are no significant links between age and social capital when social capital is measured through the resources it gives access to (see the following section on the resources generator), although there is a significant link when the value of social capital is measured through professional prestige (see the following section on the position generator; van der Gaag & Snijders, 2005; van der Gaag, Snijders, & Flap, in press).
As a multicultural and (officially) bilingual country, language is an important and multifaceted aspect of Canadian social life. Some attention has been paid to language politics in Canadian sport, specifically the ways in which language has become a site of discrimination against French Canadian athletes in highperformance and professional sport (Donnelly, Kidd, Harvey, Laberge, & Rail, 2001; Kidd, 1992; Lavoie, 1998). However, in this article we are interested in a different

210 Harvey, Lévesque, and Donnelly
question, namely, is there a relationship between language and social capital? To our knowledge, there are no studies relating specifically to sport volunteerism, social capital, and language.
Nor have we found any evidence of a social-network approach being used to conduct research on the social capital of Canada's two official linguistic communities. However, one survey of a representative sample of the Canadian population (Statistics Canada, 2004) found significantly lower levels of indicators of social capital (e.g., level of trust toward institutions or individuals, number of voluntary organizations people are engaged in) among residents of Québec (francophone majority) than among Ontario residents (anglophone majority).
Studies of sport and social capital have often favored Putnam's approach. Lawson (2005) argues that sport and physical education professionals, programs, and policies aimed at empowering communities may
produce and reinforce social networks involving participants, their family systems, other residents, and other helping professions. Vibrant social networks produce rich stocks of social trust, norms of reciprocity, and conditions conductive to cooperation, coordination and collaboration. These social networks animate democracy and sustain its civil society. (p. 138) In their report to the European Union on sport, refugees, and asylum seekers, Amara et al. (2004) provide examples of initiatives in which sport developed bonding, bridging, and linking social capital for these population groups. They also point to examples where these initiatives did not develop social capital. Tonts (2005) presents nuanced conclusions on the relationship between competitive sport and social capital in the context of rural Australia. He first concludes that sport events and clubs can be seen as sites of social networking and therefore ". . . form the basis for both the creation and expression of social capital" (p. 147). Moreover, he argues that sport in these rural communities often provides bridging social capital between people of different class, age, and race. He adds that the bonding social capital creates a sense of identity and belonging to specific communities or clubs but, interestingly, also acknowledges that, at times, bonding social capital also facilitates the exclusion of certain citizens along race, gender, and social class lines, showing that social capital also has a "dark side." Jarvie, (2003); Maguire, Jarvie, Mansfield, & Bradley (2002); and Smith and Ingham (2003) have also documented the role of sport in the reproduction and regeneration of community social capital. They argue that there are ways in which sport can positively contribute to community social capital, although it cannot be assumed that sport always increases social capital all the time. Smith and Ingham (2003) highlight this situation in their exploration of public discussions (i.e., town meetings) on the development of professional sport stadiums in the United States. They argue that the public subsidization of professional sport facilities does not contribute to or (re)generate the sense of a "community-as-awhole, but might further divide residents depending upon their situated interests" (p. 252). Dyreson (2001) addresses the limitations of Putnam's views on sport, pointing out that the idea that sport contributes to social capital is hardly a new one in the United States and has been central to American culture at least since the late 19th century. He also notes that this equation is far from simple and that

Sport Volunteerism and Social Capital 211
there are situations in which sport can promote division, excessive competition, and unhealthy practices among people and communities. Finally, he argues that "sport creates social connections that often have more to do with markets and consumers than democracy" (Dyreson, 2001, p. 24).
Other scholars are examining sport through Bourdieu's approach to social capital. Curtis, McTeer, and White (2003) and Stempel (2005, 2006) demonstrate how youth sport participation is a predictor of higher income in adulthood, using Bourdieu's theoretical framework to underline the interconnections between economic, social, cultural, and physical capital. Alegi's (2000) study of soccer in Africa illustrates Bourdieu's approach to social capital as resources grounded in network connections, even though Alegi does not adopt this as an explicit theoretical framework. Alegi examined the importance of soccer to the social experiences of Black African workers, entrepreneurs, and political leaders, and analyzed how people subject to systemic discrimination and without political rights used soccer as a site for developing social networks based on community identities at a national, regional, and local level. Specifically, although Black African workers and youth were generally not interested in seeking personal mobility in the political sphere, they often turned to soccer for self-advancement, as well as to contribute to community development. Litwin's (2003) network-based approach showed that physically active older adults are more socially connected. Furthermore, the older adults in diverse networks consisting of connections across the spheres of friends, neighbors, and family were most likely to engage in physical activity.
Although the studies just discussed touch on different aspects of the relationship between sport and social capital, only Tonts (2005) considers the relationships between sport volunteerism and social capital, arguing that the role of volunteers is particularly important. Through various examples, he shows that sport volunteers provide key resources to their community such as time, expertise, and material resources; he adds that individuals often gain social capital through their volunteer work that, as the network-based social capital tradition implies, may benefit them when they need access to resources they do not possess. This review underlines the point that there are commonplace assumptions about the positive contribution of sport to the social capital of individuals and society. However, given the limited research on the relationship between sport volunteerism and social capital, it is no surprise that we have found no literature in English or in French on age, gender, and language as they relate to social capital and sport volunteerism.
Method
Questionnaires were sent to volunteers in two different sport associations (one individual sport and one team sport) in two geographic locations in Canada (one in Québec and one in Ontario). The two sports are prominent Olympic sports in Canada and are among those in which children and youth participate the most. Because of their prevalence in Canada, the sports potentially represent extensive opportunities for building diverse social networks, hence social capital for the participants and volunteers. The associations surveyed are nonprofit voluntary organizations active at the civic local community level, which means that they are not active in schools. The associations are affiliated with their respective provincial and national associations

212 Harvey, Lévesque, and Donnelly
and are remarkably similar in their structure and scope of action. They are located in urban and suburban communities close to large cities. The key distinction rests in the fact that they exist in two different speech communities--one majority anglophone community and one majority francophone community. This is not to suggest that these communities are isolated entities or that language is the sole differentiating regional characteristic between these two groups of sport volunteers. Rather, in this article, language helps to define the structural and cultural boundaries of the larger French and English communities that are at the core of the Canadian social fabric. As Omoto and Snyder suggest (2002, p. 848):
We consider community as both context and process for volunteer efforts. That is, many volunteer efforts are situated squarely in a community. The standards, norms, resources, and institutions of the community provide a backdrop for volunteer efforts. And, in reciprocal fashion, a community is often directly and indirectly changed by the activities of volunteers and the time and energy that they invest in responding to the needs of the community. Thus, we believe that considerations of the interplay between community context and volunteer activities are especially important to investigate, both theoretically and empirically. In the case of the team sport, questionnaires were sent to half of the total number of volunteers (every second name on the list of members provided by the associations). For the individual-sport associations in both Québec and Ontario, questionnaires were sent to all the volunteers. We mailed 1,000 questionnaires and 271 were returned. This 27.1% response rate is considered a fairly good return rate for mailed questionnaires. The measures of social capital were realized using two tools, the social position generator and the resources generator, developed by a team of Dutch researchers1 and translated and adapted to Canadian society. Each tool emphasizes a different aspect of social capital. The Position Generator The position generator measures individuals' access to people with different social statuses. From a theoretical point of view, the argument is that individuals who occupy the highest social positions are also the ones who own the most useful resources for individuals and that access to these social positions constitutes potential access to the resources they possess (Lin, 2001). To estimate the value of social capital within this framework, the position generator allows researchers to measure the possibility that a respondent may contact different people with diverse occupations, with the understanding that in Western societies, occupation would be the best indicator of the social positions of social actors. Therefore, the position generator allows the identification of potential access to different occupations, from the medical doctor to the construction worker, chosen as representatives of a wide range of social statuses existing within Western societies. Data collected with the position generator make it possible to generate several social capital indices. The more commonly used index among researchers, first proposed by Lin (2001), is based on the total number of positions reached through the networks. One of the limitations of this index is that it implicitly assumes that

Sport Volunteerism and Social Capital 213
all social positions (occupations) are equivalent in terms of the resources they possess. For example, two individuals may be in contact with the same number of occupations, according them the same value for their respective social capital scores. The types of occupations accessed by the two individuals, however, may be quite different (e.g., individual A may be in contact with people with high-socialstatus occupations such as a physician, engineer, or manager, while individual B may have associations with people with more modest occupations such as cook or mechanic).
To overcome this difficulty, some researchers have suggested creating indices that take into account the social value associated with various occupations (e.g., van der Gaag et al., in press). At this point, the challenge rests in identifying a mechanism through which a relative value can be associated with each occupation, a value that is not purely arbitrary. For the purposes of this study, we used the International Socioeconomic Index (ISEI; Ganzedoom & Treiman, 2003), which emphasizes the economic and social resources associated with occupations, rather than using a scale of prestige levels for each occupation. By attributing an ISEI value to each occupation included in the position generator, it is possible to calculate different indices of the value of the social capital possessed by individuals.2 Three indices may be calculated directly: total, average, and maximum values of positions accessed. A fourth index has also been created with regard to the dispersal of the value of social positions accessed, the hypothesis here being that the greater the diversity, the greater the variety of resources accessible to individuals through their social networks (Campbell, Marsden, & Hurlbert, 1986; Degenne & Forse, 1999; Huang & Tausig, 1990; Lévesque & White, 2001). The Resources Generator
The resources generator permits the identification of the resources the respondents effectively have access to through their social networks (van der Gaag & Snijders, 2005). It includes such questions as: Is there anyone in your family, or among your friends or acquaintances, that you could easily ask for help in finding a summer job for a family member or to give you a good reference when applying for a job? This tool explores access to 13 different resources and, therefore, addresses the social capital effectively available to an individual during a given period. From the resources generator, an index was created corresponding to the total number of resources respondents have access to through their social networks3 (see Table 1) (van der Gaag & Snijders, 2005). In addition to the measures revealing the value of social capital possessed by the respondents, data were gathered in order to make it possible to distinguish between the types of links through which resources or positions were accessed. Indeed, after the pioneering work of Granovetter (1973, 1995) in this area, we know that specific social ties carry more types of resources than others. Therefore, given the circumstances, drawing from weak ties may be more useful than drawing from strong ones. Strong ties are conceptualized differently by researchers using this categorization, but all approaches have as a common denominator the utilization of affective or emotive proximity. Family, friendship, and conjugal ties constitute the main examples of strong ties, whereas weak ties involve a smaller affective engagement--for example, reference is made here to colleagues at work, landlords, acquaintances, and so on. Given the

Results and Discussion
Results for the different measures of social capital as a function of gender are shown in Table 1. The results show a large variation in social capital possessed by study participants. For example, for male respondents, the number of positions varies between 29 (the maximum possible) and 1. Similarly, the total accessed resources for male respondents varies between 13 (the maximum value) and 1 (the minimum). Results for the indices based on the value of position accessed show the same variability. In short, these results reveal great inequality in the distribution of social capital among study participants. Moreover, this inequality of access to social capital does not seem to be randomly distributed. For example, the measures show important differences between men and women. These differences are particularly evident with regard to two indices, the average accessed value and total accessed resources through weak ties--in both cases, to the disadvantage of women. This difference is particularly striking after an examination of the differences between the two groups in the availability of weak ties, a category in which women score a strong deficit. These results are consistent with several other studies that made the same observation about a structural social capital deficit for women (see Lin, 2000). The gaps between men and women in the value of weak ties suggest that women's forms of sociability, influenced by gender in society, facilitate the creation and development of strong ties associated with family space, as opposed to the maintenance and improvement of weak ties associated with participation in the labor force or in the economic sphere.
Two indicators of social capital are associated with the age of our respondents (results not shown in the tables). The highest accessed value and the range in accessed value tend to increase with the age of the respondents. Here again the position the individual occupies in the workplace most probably explains this variation since individuals tend to occupy more prestigious jobs with increasing age, which puts them more directly in contact with social positions with greater value.
Finally, spoken language is also associated with two indicators of social capital (results not shown in the tables). Francophones rank higher in terms of range in accessed value, while Anglophones rank higher in terms of average accessed value. These descriptive results show that the formation of social capital may be affected by the different social characteristics of social actors.
As noted previously, the objective of this pilot project was not to measure specifically the influence of volunteerism on the development of social capital or vice versa. In fact, the data available do not permit comparisons between volunteers involved in sport, a comparable group of volunteers not involved in sport, and a comparable group not involved in volunteering--a necessary comparison in order to precisely establish the relationship between social capital and sport volunteerism. Rather, the measures used in this study were intended to test the hypothesized link between the value of, as well as the characteristics of, individuals' social capital and their level of volunteer involvement in sport organizations. This hypothesis

216 Harvey, Lévesque, and Donnelly
rests on the premise that such a link between social capital and level of involvement should grow as a function of greater volunteer involvement.
The level of volunteer involvement is measured through three indicators (see Table 2): the number of months during which the respondent has been a volunteer in the last year, the average duration of the volunteer involvement per month during the last year; and the average lifetime duration of volunteer involvement. These three indicators target different dimensions of volunteer involvement. The first two measure intensity for one year, a relatively short period of time. They may be affected by different situational factors, such as the presence of children or the specific needs of one sport or organization. The last indicator concerns long-term involvement that is less susceptible to influence by situational circumstances; therefore, it has the potential to better reflect a more deep-rooted motivation to volunteer. Analysis of the results for these three indicators reveals that they are influenced by different factors. Indeed, there are significant differences between men and women, and among different age groups, with regard to the number of months of volunteering during the last year (see Table 2). Women and individuals older than 25 years of age tend to volunteer for a longer period of time than other groups. With regard to the intensity of volunteerism, measured by the number of hours per month, there is no significant difference according to gender and age categories, but there is a difference according to spoken language. Finally, the only significant difference with regard to lifetime involvement, and one that is fairly obvious, is related to the age of the individuals. Therefore, it is highly probable that short-term involvement, as measured in this study, implies different social logics as compared with longterm involvement. This last point is important because it suggests that a different relationship may exist between social capital and volunteerism according to types of volunteer involvement.
In order to test the hypothesized relationship between the characteristics of individuals' social capital and types of volunteer involvement, a regression model was constructed for each indicator of involvement (see Table 3). Each model includes the sociodemographic characteristics considered in the two previous tables, as well as all the indices of social capital discussed previously. These models allow us to see whether there is a significant relationship between indicators of social capital and volunteerism while taking into account the effect of individuals' sociodemographic characteristics. According to the results in Table 3, none of the indices of social capital appear to have had a significant influence on volunteer participation in the past year. The number of months spent volunteering is only linked to gender and age. With regard to the number of hours per month, there is no association with any of the variables used in the model. This may be explained by the fact that the number of hours spent volunteering is influenced less by the individual characteristics of the respondents than by the type of involvement requested by the organizations for which they volunteer. Indeed, it is conceivable that individuals, as soon as they decide to volunteer, become involved because of the organization's demands or specific needs. For example, in some organizations, parents or guardians volunteer as a requirement of their child's participation in the sport activity or organization, and this requirement remains somewhat constant throughout a given year.
A significant link with the characteristics of social capital is visible with regard to lifetime volunteer involvement. Other than age, for which a significant relationship is obvious, only the indicators of social capital seem to have a

Sport Volunteerism and Social Capital 219
significant influence for participants in this study. The two indicators of social capital that have a significant influence, the number of positions accessed and the total accessed value indicators, do not express the same thing. The first refers to the total number of positions individuals have access to without taking into consideration the socially constructed value of these social status positions, and it is negatively associated with the level of volunteer involvement. The second refers to the total value of the social status positions accessed, and not to the number of links. It is positively associated with volunteer involvement. Although the results do not allow us to establish the direction of the relationship (i.e., whether social capital increases volunteerism or vice versa), they nevertheless show that there is a relationship between social capital and lifetime volunteer involvement in sport organizations.
The fact that the two indicators of social capital have a reverse relationship with volunteer involvement, one positive and one negative, is a function of the social capital theory of measure per se. As emphasized previously, the number of positions accessed in individuals' social networks rests on the assumption that the social value of the positions is equivalent, while the other indices attribute a given weight to each of the positions from the perspective of the social resources they possess. These two indices may generate different results. The inverse relationship indicates that, on the one hand, the more individuals are involved as long-term volunteers in sport, the less access they have to a wide variety of social positions; but, on the other hand, the social positions they have access to are of a higher value in the social hierarchy. In other words, these less diversified positions of the long-term volunteer nevertheless provide access to more resources in terms of social capital. The inverse relationship allows us to advance the hypothesis that long-term volunteers tend to limit their involvement in other social spheres; this, in return, would reduce the scope and the diversity of their social networks. Although available data do not permit a test of this hypothesis, the result is similar to other research arguing that the generation of social capital involves investments from social actors. Within an opportunity­cost logic, it is possible that actors investing themselves in sport possess/are left with fewer resources to invest in other sectors, therefore limiting the diversity of their social capital while not necessarily hurting its value.
Conclusion
This article focuses on the relationship between sport volunteerism and social capital using an approach inspired by both Bourdieu and the social-network tradition. In the absence of a control group, and given the limited sample in this survey, the results are not as statistically strong as might be expected; nonetheless, they confirm that there is a link between sport volunteerism and social capital. Despite the fact that the results do not indicate the direction of a presumed causal link between social capital and volunteerism, these results are important for our understanding of volunteerism in sport. They indicate that existing relationships between social capital and volunteerism are related to long-term volunteer involvement; the indicators of short-term involvement do not show a link between volunteerism and social capital. This evidence illustrates the constructed dimension of social capital as a resource (Bourdieu, 1986). In other words, social capital--as with other forms

220 Harvey, Lévesque, and Donnelly
of capital--is a resource that may be partially inherited but is mostly developed and accumulated through investments and exchanges made by social actors, and it therefore develops and accumulates with time.
Indeed, since social capital is produced through the qualitative and quantitative development of social networks, it is unreasonable to expect that it will change significantly as a result of short-term investments in volunteering. Besides, while the production of social capital is not always the result of explicit individual strategies, it makes sense to believe that individuals engaged in short-term volunteering tend to emphasize the immediate advantages of this involvement (e.g., what the short-term volunteering involvement may provide for their children) rather than the long-term, intangible consequences (e.g., long-term volunteers are motivated to become involved out of a desire to develop their sport). This latter type of motivation and involvement, in comparison to the former, is more likely to engage individuals in actions that contribute to the development of social capital.
The results presented here are consistent with other research using the socialnetwork approach to social capital, namely, the unequal distribution of social capital as a function of several social factors such as class, age, gender, and ethnicity. This observation speaks to the complexity of the distribution, formation, and reproduction of social capital not only within society in general but also within smaller social worlds such as community sport organizations. Given the limitations of this study, our examination of this major aspect of social capital is modest. Only large-scale studies could provide enough information to study such aspects of social capital in sufficient detail.
The results of this pilot study, however, appear promising enough to argue for more research on the relationship between sport volunteerism and social capital in order to understand more clearly the mechanisms at work. Such a study should include a wide variety of sports with different characteristics and be conducted with a large enough sample to include summer and winter sports as well as individual and team sports. The study should also be conducted with a sample large enough to permit regional comparisons.
