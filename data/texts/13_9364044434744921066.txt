Abstract

This paper contains a construction for independent sets in the powers of the comple-

ments of odd cycles. In particular, we show that 

C

2n 2n+3

 22n + 1. It follows that

for n  0 we have (C2n+3) > 2, where (G) denotes the Shannon capacity of graph G.

1 Introduction

Let G = (V, E) be a graph. For d  1 let Gd be the graph with vertex set V d and an edge
between distinct vertices (x1, . . . , xd) and (y1, . . . , yd) if and only if xi = yi or {xi, yi}  E for i = 1, . . . , d. It is obvious that (Gd)  ((G))d, where (H) is the size of the largest
independent set in graph H. The Shannon capacity of G is

(G) = sup  Gd

1/d
.

d

This graph invariant was introduced by Shannon in 1956 and gives a measure of the optimal zero-error performance of an associated memoryless communication channel [11] (for a survey of zero-error information theory see [8]).
Motivated in part by the problem of determining the Shannon capacities of graphs, Berge introduced the notion of a perfect graph [3]. A graph G is perfect if (H) = (H) for every induced subgraph H of G, where (H) is the size of the largest clique in H and (H) is the chromatic number of H. Perfect graphs are known to satisfy (G) = (G). Berge conjectured that a graph is perfect if and only if it does not contain an odd cycle of length five or more, or the complement of such a graph, as an induced subgraph. This long standing conjecture, known as the strong perfect graph conjecture, was recently proved in a sequence of results by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas [5] (for an overview of the proof, see [6]). It follows from this result that the odd cycles of length five or more

and their complements are the minimal graphs for which the determination of the Shannon capacity is nontrivial.
The best known upper bounds on the Shannon capacities of these graphs are given by the Lova´sz theta function [9]:

Since (C52) = 5, this upper bound suffices to establish the Shannon capacity of C5, which is self complementary: (C5) = (C5) = 5. However, the Shannon capacities of odd cycles and the complements of odd cycles on seven or more vertices remain unknown. While some attention has been given to finding lower bounds on the Shannon capacities of odd cycles (see [2, 4, 7, 12]), the best known lower bound on the Shannon capacities of the complements of the odd cycles on seven or more vertices is the trivial

 C2n+1   C2n+1 = 2.

The question whether this lower bound is actually the truth is mentioned, e.g., in [1, 10]. Here we show, by means of a construction, that it is not.

Theorem 1. For n  0 we have

Corollary 2. For n  0 we have

2 Construction

For

ease

of

notation,

we

identify

the

vertices

of

C

d 2n+3

and

the

elements

of

the

abelian

group Zd2n+3 in the natural way. Adjacency in C2n+3 can be expressed in terms of the group

operation: distinct u, v  Z2n+3 are adjacent in C2n+3 if and only if u-v  {-1, 1}. Thus, a

vertex set X  Z2dn+3 is an independent set if for distinct x = (x1, . . . , xd), y = (y1, . . . , yd) 

X there exists i such that xi - yi  {-1, 1}. For example, {0, 1}d is an independent set in

C

d 2n+3

(this

independent

set

is

called

the

standard

independent

set

below).

We illustrate the spirit of the construction on the n = 1 case of the theorem (i.e., by

showing (C25)  5). We start with the standard independent set {0, 1}2. We would like to

modify this independent set in such a way that we can add one more vertex. We do this by

`moving' the vertices in {0, 1}2 as follows

(0, 0)  (0, 4) (0, 1)  (4, 1) (1, 1)  (1, 2) (1, 0)  (2, 0).

Note that the new set, {(0, 4), (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)}, is an independent set, and we can add the vertex (3, 3) to this set in order to achieve an independent set of the desired size.

Now, let n  0 and d = 2n. We begin with the standard independent set {0, 1}d in Zd2n+3. As in the previous example, we `move' these vertices in such a way that the new set is still an independent set and one additional vertex can be added. In the following claim we construct a function f : {0, 1}d  {0, 1, . . . , n}d that will help us control the movement. For 1  i  d and x  {0, 1}d we let fi(x) denote the ith coordinate of f (x).
Claim 3. Let n  0 and d = 2n. There exists a function f : {0, 1}d  {0, 1, . . . , n}d such that
(a) for all x  {0, 1}d there exists 1  i  d such that fi(x) = n.
(b) for all distinct x, y  {0, 1}d there exists 1  i  d such that either
xi = yi and fi(x) = fi(y) = 0 or xi = yi and |fi(x) - fi(y)| = 1. (1)

Proof. We go by induction on n. For n = 0 we simply let f be identically equal to zero. Let n  1 and suppose g : {0, 1}2n-1  {0, 1, . . . , n - 1}2n-1 satisfies the n - 1 case of the
claim. We use g to construct f : {0, 1}2n  {0, 1, . . . , n}2n by considering the coordinates
of {0, 1}2n in pairs. For x  {0, 1}2n and 1  j  2n-1 define

0 zj(x) = 1

if x2j-1 = x2j if x2j-1 = x2j .

This produces z(x) in {0, 1}2n-1. Now, for j = 1, . . . , 2n-1 define

f2j-1(x) =

gj(z(x)) + 1 0

if zj(x) = 0 if zj(x) = 1,

0 f2j(x) = gj(z(x)) + 1

if zj(x) = 0 if zj(x) = 1.

It remains to check that f has the desired properties. Consider x  {0, 1}d. Since there exists a coordinate j such that gj(z(x)) = n - 1, there exists a coordinate i, either 2j - 1 or 2j, such that fi(x) = n. Thus, f satisfies (a).
Consider distinct x, y  {0, 1}d. Assume first that z(x) = z(y). Then there exists a pair of coordinates 2j - 1, 2j such that x and y differ in both of these coordinates. In one of these coordinates, say k  {2j - 1, 2j}, we have fk(x) = fk(y) = 0. Thus the first part of (1) holds.
Next, assume that z(x) = z(y). Applying property (b) of g to z(x), z(y), we find a
coordinate j for which one of the two parts of (1) holds. Suppose first that zj(x) = zj(y) and gj(z(x)) = gj(z(y)) = 0. There exists a unique k  {2j - 1, 2j} such that xk = yk. Either fk(x) = gj(z(x)) + 1 = 1 and fk(y) = 0 or fk(x) = 0 and fk(y) = gj(z(y)) + 1 = 1. In either case, the second part of (1) holds.
Suppose, on the other hand, that j is a coordinate such that zj(x) = zj(y) and |gj(z(x))- gj(z(y))| = 1. Either x2j-1 = y2j-1 and x2j = y2j or x2j-1 = y2j-1 and x2j = y2j. In the

3

first case, note that there exists a unique k  {2j - 1, 2j} such that fk(x) = gj(z(x)) + 1 and fk(y) = gj(z(y)) + 1. It follows that
|fk(x) - fk(y)| = |gj(z(x)) - gj(z(y))| = 1,
and the second part of (1) holds. In the second case, note that there exists a unique k  {2j - 1, 2j} such that fk(x) = fk(y) = 0. Now the first part of (1) holds. We have verified that f satisfies (b).

We replace each x  {0, 1}d with x defined by

xi =

xi + fi(x) xi - fi(x)

if xi = 1 if xi = 0,

where the operations are taken in Z2n+3. It follows from condition (b) on the function f that the set x : x  {0, 1}d is an independent set. It follows from condition (a) that

x : x  {0, 1}d  {(n + 2, n + 2, . . . , n + 2)}

is an independent set.
