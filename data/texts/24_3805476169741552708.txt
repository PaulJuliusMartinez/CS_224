Abstract
The inequality of Vapnik and Chervonenkis controls the expectation of the function by its sample average uniformly over a VC-major class of functions taking into account the size of the expectation. Using Talagrand's kernel method we prove a similar result for the classes of functions for which Dudley's uniform entropy integral or bracketing entropy integral is finite.

1 Introduction and main results.

Let  be a measurable space with a probability measure P and n be a product space with a product measure P n. Consider a family of measurable functions F = {f :   [0, 1]}. Denote

Pf =

n
f dP, f¯ = n-1 f (xi), x = (x1, . . . , xn)  n.
i=1

The main purpose of this paper is to provide probabilistic bounds for P f in terms of f¯ and the complexity assumptions on class F . We are trying to extend the following result of Vapnik and Chervonenkis ([17]). Let C be a class of sets in . Let

S(n) = max
xn

{x1, . . . , xn}  C : C  C

The VC dimension d of class C is defined as

d = inf{j  1 : S(j) < 2j}.

C is called VC if d < . The class of functions F is called VC-major if the class of sets

C = {x   : f (x)  t} : f  F, t  R

is a VC class of sets in , and the VC dimension of F is defined as the VC dimension of C. The inequality of Vapnik and Chervonenkis states that (see Theorem 5.3 in [18]) if F is a

VC-major class of [0, 1] valued functions with dimension d then for all  > 0 with probability at least 1 -  for all f  F

The factor (P f )-1/2 allows interpolation between the n-1 rate for P f in the optimistic zero error case f¯ = 0 and the n-1/2 rate in the pessimistic case when f¯ is "large". In this paper we
will prove a bound of a similar nature under different assumptions on the complexity of the class F . Using Talagrand's abstract concentration inequality in product spaces and the related kernel method for empirical processes [14] we will first prove a general result that interpolates
between optimistic and pessimistic cases. Then we will give examples of application of this
general result in two situations when it is assumed that either Dudley's uniform entropy integral
is finite or the bracketing entropy integral is finite.
Let us formulate Talagrand's concentration inequality that is used in the proof of our main Theorem 2 below. Consider a probability measure  on n and x  n. We will denote by xi the ith coordinate of x. If Ci = {y  n : yi = xi}, we consider the image of the restriction of  to Ci by the map y  yi, and its Radon-Nikodym derivative di with respect to P. As in [14] we assume that  is finite and each point is measurable with a positive measure. Let m be a
number of atoms in  and p1, . . . , pm be their probabilities. By the definition of di we have

g(yi)d(y) = g(yi)di(yi)dP (yi).
Ci 

For  > 0 we define a function (x) by

(x) =

x2/(4), when x  2, x - , when x  2.

We set

m(, x) =

(di)dP and m(A, x) = inf{m(, x) : (A) = 1}.

in

For each  > 0 let L be any positive number satisfying the following inequality:

2L(e1/L - 1)  . 1 + 2L

The following theorem holds (see [9]).

(1.3)

The factor (f ) will play the same role as (nP f )1/2 plays in (1.1) The following theorem holds.

Theorem 2 Let L  1.12. If (1.5) holds then for any u > 0,

P f  F (P f - f (xi))  M (f ) + 2 LnuP f  2e-u
in

(1.6)

Proof. The proof of the theorem repeats the proof of Theorem 2 in [9] with some minor

modifications, but we will give it here for completeness. Let us consider the set A = {Z(x) 

M }. Clearly, P n(A)  1/2. Let us fix a point x  n and then choose f  F . For any point

y  A we have

Let us denote the random variable  = f (y1), F(t) - the distribution function of , and ci = f (xi). For c  [0, 1] define the function h(c) as
1
h(c) = (f (y1) - c)2I(f (y1) > c)dP (y1) = (t - c)2dF(t).

 For u  nP f /L the infimum over  > 1 equals 2 LnuP f. On the other hand, for u  nP f /L

this infimum is greater than 2nP f whereas the left-hand side is always less than nP f.

We will now give two examples of normalization (f ) where we can prove that (1.5) holds.

1.1 Uniform entropy conditions.

Given a probability distribution Q on  we denote

dQ,2(f, g) = (Q(f - g)2)1/2

an L2-distance on F with respect to Q. Fiven u > 0 we say that a subset F  F is u-separated if for any f = g  F we have dQ,2(f, g) > u. Let the packing number D(F , u, L2(Q)) be the maximal cardinality of any u-separated set. We will say that F satisfies the uniform

entropy condition if


log D(F , u)du < ,

(1.8)

0

where

sup D(F , u, L2(Q))  D(F , u)
Q

and the supremum is taken over all discrete probability measures. It is well known (see, for

example, [3]) that if one considers the subset Fp = {f  F : P f  p}, then the expectation of

supFp (P f - f (xi)) can be estimated (in some sense, since the symmetrization argument is

required) by

p

 (p) = n

log D(F , u)du.

(1.9)

0
We will prove that it holds for all p > 0 simultaneously.

and taking expectation of both sides with respect to x would prove (1.10). To show the

remaining implication we consider two cases when nP f  f (yi) and nP f  f (yi). First

assume that nP f  f (yi). Since, as easily checked, both (p) and p/(p) are increasing we

get

(P f - f (xi))  (P f )

(f (yi) (n-1

- f (xi)) f (yi))



(f (yi) - f (xi (f¯(x, y))

Clearly, this will prove the statement of the theorem. For a fixed x, y  n let

F = {(f (x1), . . . , f (xn), f (y1), . . . , f (yn)) : f  F }  R2n

and

d(f, g) =

,

f, g  F.

i=1

The packing number of F with respect to d can be bounded by D(F, u, d)  D(F , u). Consider an increasing sequence of sets

{0} = F0  F1  F2  . . .
such that for any g = h  Fj, d(g, h) > 2-j and for all f  F there exists g  Fj such that d(f, g)  2-j. The cardinality of Fj can be bounded by
|Fj |  D(F, 2-j, d)  D(F , 2-j).
For simplicity of notations we will write D(u) := D(F , u). If D(2-j) = D(2-j-1) then in the construction of the sequence (Fj) we will set Fj equal to Fj+1. We will now define the sequence of projections j : F  Fj, j  0 in the following way. If f  F is such that d(f, 0)  (2-j-1, 2-j] then set 0(f ) = . . . = j(f ) = 0 and for k  j + 1 choose k(f )  Fk such that d(f, k(f ))  2-k. In the case when Fk = Fk+1 we will choose k(f ) = k+1(f ). This construction implies that d(k-1(f ), k(f ))  2-k+2. Let us introduce a sequence of sets
j = {g - h : g  Fj, h  Fj-1, d(g, h)  2-j+2}, j  1,
and let j = {0} if D(2-j) = D(2-j+1). The cardinality of j does not exceed |j|  |Fj|2  D(2-j)2.
By construction any f  F can be represented as a sum of elements from j

f = (j(f ) - j-1(f )), j(f ) - j-1(f )  j .

1.2 Bracketing entropy conditions.

Given two functions g, h :   [0, 1] such that g  h and (P (h - g)2)1/2  u we will call a set
of all functions f such that g  f  h a u-bracket with respect to L2(P ). The u-bracketing number N[](F , u, L2(P )) is the minimum number of u-brackets needed to cover F . Assume that


log N[](F , u, L2(P ))du < 

(1.11)

0

and denote

p



(p) = n

log N[](F , u, L2(P ))du.

Then the following theorem holds.

We omit the proof of this theorem since it is a modification of a standard bracketing entropy bound (see Theorem 2.5.6 and 2.14.2 in [15]) similar to what Theorem 3 is to the standard uniform entropy bound. The argument is more subtle as it involves a truncation argument required by the application of Bernstein's inequality but otherwise it repeats Theorem 3. Combining Theorem 2 and Theorem 4 we get

Corollary 2 If (1.11) holds then there exists an absolute constant K > 0 such that for any u > 0 with probability at least 1 - 2e-u for all f  F

2 Examples of application.
Example 1 (VC-subgraph classes of functions). A class of functions F is called VC-subgraph if the class of sets
C = {(, t) :   , t  R, t  f ()} : f  F

An Inequality of Vapnik and Chervonenkis

is a VC-class of sets in  × R. The VC dimension of F is equal to the VC dimension d of C. On can use Corollary 3 in [4] to show that

D(F , u)  e(d + 1)

(2.1)

where K > 0 is an absolute constant. Instead of the log n on the right-hand side of (2.1) one could also write log(1/P f ), but we simplify the bound to eliminate this dependence on P f. Note that the bound is similar to the bound (1.2) for VC classes of set and VC-major classes. Unfortunately, our proof does not allow us to recover the same small value of K = 2 as for VC classes of sets. (2.1) improves the main result in [7], where it was shown that for any fixed  > 0 for any  > 0 with probability at least 1 -  for all f  F

(2.2)

It is easy to see that, in a sense, one would get (2.1) from (2.2) only after optimizing over . Indeed, for P f < , (2.2) gives

1 n

(P f - f (xi)) <

 11 d log + log

&which is implied by (2.1) as well. For P f , (2.2) gives

1/2
,

1 n

(P f - f (xi)) <

P f 1/2 P f 1 1 d log + log

which compared to (2.1) contains an additional factor of (P f /)1/2. In the situation when  is small (this is the only interesting case) this factor introduces an unnecessary penalty for any function f such that P f . Hence, for a fixed  (2.2) improves the bound for P f   at cost of f with P f  . One can find alternative extensions of (2.2) in [5]. For some other applications of Corollary 1 see [10]. Example 2 (Bracketing entropy). Assume that either

D(F , u)  cu- or N[](F , u, L2(P ))  cu-,   (0, 2).
