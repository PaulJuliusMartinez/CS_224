Background: Sedentary behaviors, particularly television viewing (TV) time, are associated with adverse health outcomes in adults, independent of physical activity levels. These associations are stronger and more consistent for women than for men. Methods: Multivariate regression models examined the sociodemographic correlates of 2 categories of TV time (2 hours/day and 4 hours/day); in a large, population-based sample of Australian adults (4950 men, 6001 women; mean age 48.1 years, range 25­91) who participated in the 1999/2000 Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study. Results: Some 46% of men and 40% of women watched  2 hours TV/day; 9% and 6% respectively watched  4 hours/day. For both men and women, 2 hours TV/day was associated with less than tertiary education, living outside of state capital cities, and having no paid employment. For women, mid and older age (45­64 and 65+) were also significant correlates of 2 hours TV/day. Similar patterns of association were observed in those viewing 4 hours/day. Conclusions: Prolonged TV time is associated with indices of social disadvantage and older age. These findings can inform the understanding of potential contextual influences and guide preventive initiatives. Keywords: television, gender, demographics, AusDiab

Participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity has well-established health benefits, and public health guidelines for frequency and quantity of physical activity have existed for over a decade.1,2 Recent research has identified sedentary behavior (typically characterized as prolonged sitting time) as an important contributor to the development of noncommunicable diseases in adults, in ways that are distinct from lack of physical activity.3 Television viewing (TV) time, as a particular sedentary behavior, has been shown to be detrimentally associated with several health outcomes, including weight gain, type 2 diabetes, abnormal glucose metabolism, the metabolic syndrome, and other cardiovascular risk factors.4­14 These detrimental associations have been observed even in those who met the public health guidelines for physical activity.10,12,13,15,16 There is evidence of dose-response relationships, with moderate

associations for TV time of at least 2 hours/day,10­12,17 and stronger associations for 4 hours/day or more.4­6,13 Stronger associations of TV time with metabolic outcomes have been found for women than men, in studies that have stratified for gender.10,12
TV time is the most common sedentary behavior during adults' nonworking hours.18­20 Data from the USA shows a rising trend in TV time over the past 50 years with an approximate doubling of average viewing hours per day.21 Recent time-use surveys from the USA and Australia show that TV time increases with age and that, on average, men spend more time watching TV than do women.22,23 A study on the correlates of prolonged TV time in Australian adults found statistically-significant relationships with lower educational attainment, not being in paid work, older age, less physical activity, and higher body mass index.13 In the same study, women were more likely to report higher (4 hours or more) TV time than did men, but there was no statistically-significant difference in mean hours of TV time between men and women. In a large nationally-representative sample from the USA, associations were found for the same variables (with the exception of physical activity), although mean TV time was higher for men than for women.24 In addition, this study reported significant relationships of higher average TV times with lower income, self-reported history of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol, being of African-American ethnicity and poorer diet, but

no relationship with living outside of an urban area.24 These studies did not, however, examine the correlates of higher TV time separately for men and women.
In the context of new evidence on gender differences in the deleterious associations of TV time with cardiometabolic health, there is a need to better understand the factors related to this prevalent sedentary behavior. We examined the associations of sociodemographic attributes (age, educational attainment, income, area of residence, employment status, living arrangement, and physical activity level) with higher TV-time categories (2 hours/day or more; 4 hours/day or more) in a large population-based sample of Australian adults, separately for men and for women.
Methods
Data Source and Measurement The Australian Diabetes, Obesity, and Lifestyle (AusDiab) study is a population-based study, initially conducted during 1999 to 2000 to examine the prevalence of diabetes and its risk factors in the Australian population. A total of 17,129 households, with at least 1 resident 25 years of age or older were approached for an initial household interview. Of the 20,347 who took part in the initial household interview, 55% (n = 11,247) attended the biomedical examination. The present analyses used data from those participants with complete data for TV time and all sociodemographic characteristics examined in this study. The final study population included 10,951 adults (4950 men, 6001 women). Ethics approval was obtained from the International Diabetes Institute; all subjects provided written informed consent.
Detailed methods, response rates, and indications of representativeness for the AusDiab study have previously been reported elsewhere.7,11,25 Of note was the higher percentage of responders who had completed the final year of high school, technical education or University, compared with nonresponders.25
In brief, interviewer-administered questionnaires ascertained TV time, leisure-time physical activity, and sociodemographic attributes. TV time (including video viewing) over the past week was reported separately for week days and for weekend days. This measure has previously shown good26 test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.82) and moderate27 correlation with behavioral log as criterion measure (: 0.3).20 Based on previous findings,4,13,17 TV time was categorized using cut points of (a) 2 hours/day (<2 hours/day; 2 hours/day) and (b) 4 hours/day (<4 hours/day; 4 hours/day).
Leisure-time physical activity, including walking for exercise or recreation, and transport, and other moderate-to-vigorous activity, was determined from reported frequency and duration of these activities over the past week using the validated Active Australia Questionnaire.28 Physical activity was calculated by summing time spent walking, time in other moderate intensity activities and double the time spent in vigorous activity

as per the `Active Australia' method.28 Activity level was divided into sufficient (150 mins/week) and insufficient (<150 mins/week) using the public health guideline for health benefits.1
Sociodemographic attributes assessed were age (categorized as 25­44, 45­64, or 65+ years); educational attainment (tertiary education including university, college, and vocational qualifications; or no tertiary education); household income adjusted for number of household members using a modified version of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) equivalence scales29 (high = $800/week or more; middle = $400 to 799/week, or low = less than $399/week); place of residence (residing in state or territory capital cities or regional centers coded from address by census area); employment status (currently in part- or full-time employment, or not); and living arrangements (living with family, alone, or in a shared household).
Statistical Analyses Analyses were conducted in Stata Statistical Software Release 10.0,30 using survey commands with the sample weighted to the 1998 estimated residential Australian population. Chi-square analysis and t-tests were used to compare gender differences for sociodemographic and TV time variables. Mean TV time (hours/day) was calculated for men and women separately for each sociodemographic and behavioral variable. The associations of prolonged TV time (2 hours/day and 4 hours/ day) with the sociodemographic and behavioral variables were examined using logistic regression models, separately for men and for women. The models included the variables of age, education, household income, residence in capital cities, employment, living arrangement, and physical activity. Alpha level was set at a conservative level of 0.01 due to the large sample size. The gender specific models were generated as men and women are known to differ in their TV time22 23 and health outcomes from prolonged viewing.10,12
Results
The mean age of the sample was 48.1 years (range 25­91). Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of participants, stratified by gender. Statistically-significant differences were observed between men and women for educational attainment, household income, employment status, living arrangement, proportions physically inactive, and TV time. Although significant (possibly a reflection of the large sample size), some of these differences were quite small. The greatest differences were seen in the proportions of men and women who had completed tertiary education (men 71%, women 56%), had low incomes (men 40%, women 52%) and middle incomes (men 48%, women 40%), were in part-time or full-time employment (men 73%, women 52%), reported insufficient leisure-time

physical activity (men 42%, women 53%), and watched  2 hours TV/day (men 46%, women 40%).
Mean TV time was 1.93 hours/day (95%CI: 1.84­ 2.03) for men and 1.71 hours/day (95%CI: 1.60­1.83) for women (gender difference: P < .001). Overall, 42.7% watched TV  2 hours/day and 7.4% watched  4 hours/ day. Table 2 shows mean TV times by the sociodemographic attributes examined in the study, separately for men and women.
Table 3 shows the adjusted logistic regression findings on the predictors of the 2 high TV-time categories (2 hours/day, 4 hours/day). Men and women who had no tertiary education, lived in a regional city outside of the state capitals, or were not employed were more likely to watch 2 hours TV/day or more. For women, those who were middle-aged (45­64 years) and older (65+ years) were more likely to report  2 hours/day of TV time, compared with those in the younger age category (25­44 years).
Similar findings emerged for the sociodemographic correlates of  4 hours/day TV time. However, for women, being in the middle (45­64years) and older (65+

years) age-groups, and for women and men, living outside a capital city were not associated with watching TV  4 hours/day. Among men, living alone compared with living with a partner or family was associated with increased likelihood of watching TV for 4 hours/day or more.
Discussion
Australian men and women who watched TV for the more-prolonged periods of time (2 hours/day or more, 4 hours/day or more) were more likely not to be employed, not to have undertaken tertiary education, and to reside outside of a capital city. We also found that age was associated with high TV viewing time in women but not in men. Our findings are consistent with previous studies in Australia and USA, which found that older age, lower educational attainment and not being employed to be correlates of higher TV viewing time.13,24 Our study extends this previous work by including a wider range of sociodemographic attributes and examining these separately for men and women. Gender differences were

found. Overall, men had higher average TV viewing time than did women, which is consistent with the findings of previous time-use studies22,23 and population-based epidemiological studies.24
The strongest correlate of higher TV time in our study was employment status. Men who were not working had twice the odds of watching TV  2 hours/day, and more than 3 times the odds of watching  4 hours/ day, compared with those who were working. It is probable that those without paid employment have more time available to watch TV. It may be that they also have less income and therefore select a relatively inexpensive recreational pursuit such as TV viewing. An earlier Australian

study found that those who reported cost as a barrier to being active were more likely to have higher rates of TV time.20 However, this is not supported by our findings: after multivariate adjustment, low household income was not significantly associated with higher TV times. Both low educational attainment and living in regional centers were associated with the odds of higher TV time for men and women. It may be that lack of opportunity for a variety of recreational pursuits could influence the choice of TV as an activity in these groups.
Consistent with other findings,13,24,31 we observed that those in older age groups had higher mean daily TV times. However, in our analysis, after adjustment for

the other sociodemographic factors, age was associated with higher TV time only among women. It is likely that adjustment for employment status affected these findings, as older age groups are less likely to be in part- or full-time work. One key finding of the large scale study carried out in the USA was an association with ethnicity; African-Americans watched higher volumes of TV than did Whites and Hispanics.24 Such ethnic comparisons are not usually possible from Australian population samples, in which ethnicity tends to be homogeneous.25
The lack of a significant relationship between TV time and physical activity is consistent with findings reported previously.32,33 The relationship between them is, however, far from clear as other studies have found TV time to be negatively associated with physical activity5,8,9,34 or shown a relationship for women but not for men.18,35 Differences in methodology may account for the discrepancy in findings for some cases where alternate activity measures were employed9,34 or a specific sample (college students) was used.35 Including the current study, all such studies have used self-report measures of physical activity and TV time.
The strengths of our study are the large sample size, the population-based survey method, and the broad age

range and sociodemographic circumstances of participants. AusDiab is a longitudinal cohort study, allowing the present findings to provide a baseline to identify trends in TV time. Limitations include the self-report of TV time and other sociodemographic and behavioral correlates. However, self-report measurement of TV time has previously been shown to have good reliability and validity.20,36
This study is the first to report specifically on the sociodemographic correlates of membership of higher TV time categories previously shown to be associated with increased cardio-metabolic risk,10,12,13,15,16 separately for men and women from a large cross section of the Australian population. Studies of the cardio-metabolic correlates of prolonged TV time have shown stronger and more consistent associations for women than for men.10,12 Our present findings, while they do not address the sources of such gender differences, nevertheless provide original descriptive data on variations between men and women in volumes of TV time, and associated differences in physical activity, and social, vocational, and residential circumstances. What we have reported here may, in the future, provide some useful empirical elements for teasing out the complex biological3 and behavioral37 interactions

600 Clark et al

that are likely to underlie the role of sedentary behavior (as distinct from lack of physical activity) as an important determinant of variations in cardio-metabolic health.
There is a growing case for addressing sedentary behavior, as well as a lack of physical activity, as part of population-wide strategies for chronic disease prevention.3,16,17,38 Our findings have the potential to inform such initiatives, through identifying the attributes of those for whom higher volumes of a ubiquitous sedentary behavior (TV time) are most prevalent.
