The explicit form of the electron density distribution p"" (x) is calculated for a localized state in a onedimensional disordered system. A general formula is obtained for the moments of p",,(x).

The question of the character of the electronic states in a one-dimensional disordered system was investigated by a number of workers (see the review by Mott[1]). Mott and Twoset2J have shown that all states in such a system are localized. The asymptotic form of the electron density for a localized state as Ix I - 00 is essentially exponential. The argument of the exponential for certain models was determined by a number of workers. [3-6J A more correct asymptotic expanSion, which includes the pre-exponential factor, was obtained by Mel'nikov, Rashba, and the author[71 with the aid of a method developed by Berezinski1. t3J In the present paper the same method is used to obtain the explicit form of the distribution of the electron density of the localized state P... (x) for arbitrary x.
We consider a system of noninteracting electrons with a dispersion law e(p), situated in the field of randomly disposed centers V(x). The random potential Vex) is characterized by a correlator U(x - x' )

U(x-x') =<V(x) V(x'».

It was shown in the preceding paper[7J that for this model the distribution of the electron density of the localized state P... (x), obtained from the expression for the long-time density correlator, is given by

USing also the known identity for the r function (formula

The first two moments of p.. (x) can be easily obtained

From (8) it follows, in particular, that the average dimension of the localized state in dimensional units is 21;. This is half the value obtained from the asymptotic form (6).

It is possible also to calculate all the succeeding moments. Indeed, after integrating twice by parts we obtain

Here l/I is the logarithmic derivative of the r function
and ~ is the Riemann zeta function. From (11), in particular, we obtain at n = 2

in accord with[3,7]. This expression determines the electronic polarizability.
A comparison of Po, Pb and P2 shows that the func-
tion P.. (x) is concentrated mainly in the region Ixl <~. This circumstance can be clearly seen from the plot of
P.. (x) (see Fig. 1). The decrease in the region Ixl <t
is mainly proportional to e-4I"I, going over gradually
-",1to the asymptotic form Ixl-3/2e at Ixl »1. The
change of the rate of decrease of the electron density is p~rticularly clearly demonstrated in Fig. 2, which shows a plot of the absolute value of the logarithmic derivative Idlnp.. (x)/dxl. This curve characterizes the deviation of the behavior of P..(x) from a pure exponential function, which would correspond to Idlnp..(x)/dx 1= const. We note that the general form of the plot in Fig. 1 is similar to the results of the computer calculation within the framework of the model of Frisch and Lloyd. [9]
