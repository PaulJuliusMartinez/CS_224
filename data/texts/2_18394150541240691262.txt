A utom atic d a ta p ro cessin g made i t s e n try in to urban planning w ith th e punched card and th e complementary ensentole o f u n it record machines such as th e key punch, th e s o r t e r , th e c o ll a t o r and th e accounting machine.

This w ill be f o l  lowed by a co n sid eratio n o f th e fu n ctio n s o f such systems and th e research d ire c tio n s th a t w ill be stim ulated by them.
THE REAL-TIME URBAN INFORMATION SYSTEM
Today's urban d a ta ty p ic a lly i s c o lle c te d from a v a s t number o f source docu ments, keypunched, v e rifie d , read on to magnetic tape and then processed. A considerable tim e lag u su ally occurs between th e i n i t i a l d ata c o lle c tio n phase and the f in a l o u tp u t. This procedure has performed s a tis f a c to r ily in problem s i t u a t i o n s f o r which a ra p id response was n o t re q u ire d . In in s ta n  ces where immediate adjustm ents to a co n tin u a lly changing and complex phen omenon a re d e s ir e d , however, a p ro ce ssin g system which i s dynam ically i n t e  grated with i t s environment is necessary. For th is kind of in te ra c tio n a re a l-tim e system is req u ired .
A re a l-tim e system i s a c e n tra l processor which m aintains a dynamic i n t e r  a c tio n w ith i t s environm ent. Perhaps th e e a s i e s t way to d i f f e r e n t i a t e a rea l-tim e operation from cu rren t computer usage in urban planning is to note th e absence o f batch processing in former system and i t s presence in th e l a t t e r . In re a l-tim e systems d a ta a re input to th e system a t random from any one o f many g e o g ra p h ic a lly d isp e rse d te rm in a l u n i t s . S e v e ra l in p u ts may a r r iv e a t th e c e n tr a l p ro ce ssin g u n it a t th e same tim e, th e re b y c re a tin g a queue o f t r a n s a c tio n s . The com puter's response to each message g e n e ra lly i s an output sent back to th e term in a l. In such a m ulticonsole system se v era l programmers are allowed immediate access to th e computer v ir tu a lly sim u ltan eo u sly . Each u s e r provided w ith a console i s a b le to e n te r a p ro  gram a t any tim e from h is te rm in a l, debug i t o n -lin e and achieve a v a stly reduced turnaround. Although in a c tu a lity each program req u ires a short period o f tim e fo r processing, th e high-speed of th e computer and th e slow r e a c tio n o f humans in e f f e c t give each u se r th e e q u iv a le n t o f a computer entirely at his disposal.
The r e a l- tim e urban in fo rm a tio n system I e n v isio n c o n s is ts o f th r e e b a s ic classes of subsystems;
1 . The in fo rm a tio n sto ra g e and r e t r i e v a l p ro cessin g subsystem which i s a file -o rie n te d d ata processing system concerned with re la tiv e ly simple c a lc u la tio n s , b u t involving massive amounts o f re p e titiv e processing;
2. The problem -solving s c i e n t i f i c subsystem which depends on th e computa tio n a l speed and a b ility o f th e computer; and

In te n s iv e development o f th e s e subsystems has alre ad y begun in many d if f e r e n t commercial, in d u s tr ia l and m ilita ry o rg a n iz a tio n s. Commercial f ile - o r ie n te d d a ta p ro ce ssin g o p e ra tio n s such as th e American A ir lin e ' s SABRE re a l-tim e re s e rv a tio n system are providing immediate inform ation fo r decision-m aking. R eal-tim e s c ie n tif ic computations are an in te g ra l p a rt of our space program and o u r m ilita r y command and c o n tro l system s. I n d u s tr ia l process c o n tro l systems have su ccessfu lly automated petroleum re fin e rie s , paper-making fa c  to r ie s and chemical p la n ts.
Although rea l-tim e systems have been operating fo r several years in the bus in e ss and m ilita ry w orlds, an in te g rate d real-tim e urban inform ation system, embodying th e component subsystems I have described above, has not y e t emerged. However, th e re i s growing evidence th a t such systems are in the o ffin g . S ta te and lo c a l governments, in creasin g ly concerned with improving th e ir data processing operations* are c r i t ic a ll y examining the p o te n tia l co n trib u tio n s o f urban data banks.2/ S c ie n tific analyses of the probable consequences of a lt e r n a t iv e governm ental a c tio n s a re re c e iv in g co n sid erab le a tt e n t i o n .2/ F in ally , p ilo t stu d ies in urban tr a f f ic control are demonstrating the re  markable e ffe ctiv en e ss of the cybernetic approach to real-tim e process optim iz a tio n in urban system s.it/ In c lo sin g , I would l ik e to h ig h lig h t th re e re c e n t e f f o r t s which exem plify, in a crude way, th e p r in c ip a l components of th e re a l-tim e urban inform ation system I have outlin ed above.

In most a p p li catio n s th e p rin c ip a l goal o f such systems has been real-tim e process optim iz a t i o n . On th e b a s is o f s ig n a ls i t re c e iv e s from v ario u s sen so rs, th e computer provides th e inform ation needed to re d ire c t an on-going process to optimum le v e ls o f o p e ra tio n .

Examples o f o p e ra tio n a l s e lf - r e g u la tin g urban systems a re r a r e . The use o f computers in urban a n a ly s is has been la r g e ly lim ite d to : ( 1 ) s c i e n t i f i c com p u ta tio n s , i . e . , m odel-building; and ( 2) ro u tin e bookeeping, i . e . , inven t o r i e s .

Encouraging e f f o r t s in t h i s d ir e c tio n , however, a re being made by t r a f f i c engineers in te re s te d in th e development of autom atic tr a f f ic control systems.
A p ilo t study to te s t the f e a s ib ility of an automatic tr a f f ic signal control system in Toronto was conducted in 1960 by th e T ra ffic Research C orporation in conjunction w ith th e M unicipality of M etropolitan Toronto .-7 For over a y e a r , a t e s t a re a w ith 16 s ig n a liz e d in te r s e c tio n s was re g u la te d by a gen eral purpose e le c tro n ic computer. A network o f t r a f f i c d e te cto rs sc attere d throughout the t e s t area provided a c en tral control u n it with a continuous supply o f d a ta concerning t r a f f i c movements. Pulses recording th e passage of v e h ic le s were transform ed in to coded form and tran sm itte d to the computer. C o n tro l programs examined th e movement p a tte r n , determ ined which s ig n a ls should be sw itched in o rd e r to b e s t accommodate th e recorded t r a f f i c flow , and then tran sm itted an output pulse to actu ate the necessary changes. This cy cle was re p e a te d every 2 seconds.
T oronto's experim ental p ro jec t demonstrated th a t i t is possible to design a very f le x ib le and powerful cybernetic system fo r co n tro llin g and improving th e flow o f t r a f f i c in an urban a re a . A comparison of the performance of the au to m atic c o n tro l system w ith t h a t o f th e e x is tin g fix ed -tim e systems showed th a t during th e morning rush hours th e co n tro l system reduced th e average d e la y p e r v e h ic le by 25 p e r c e n t.

S urveillance and Short-Range Forecasting
The f i l e - o r ie n t e d d a ta pro cessin g subsystem o f a re a l-tim e inform ation system would perform two fundam ental fu n c tio n s: ( 1 ) i t would m onitor th e urban system , and ( 2) i t would c o n tin u ally generate short-range fo re c a s ts o f ex pected future s ta te s . P rerequisite to both is an a b ility to q u antitatively d e s c rib e system s t a t e s .

O p eratio n s re s e a rc h e rs have provided management science w ith a valuable a r  se n a l o f m ethodological to o ls w ith which to d e scrib e stocks and flow s. How e v e r, t h e i r prim ary focus has been on systems which may be rep resen ted by means o f ev en ts occuring through tim e, e . g . , renewal th e o ry . Urban re se a rc h  e rs on th e o th e r hand, a re fundam entally in te re s te d in events which occur over space as w ell a s through tim e . We a re anxious to d e scrib e th e twodimensional d istrib u tio n of points, e .g ., the sp a tia l pattern of the residen t i a l population. Further, operations analysts typically are interested in flows a rriv in g a t a p o in t in space. For example, the queue of customers a r  r iv in g a t a s e rv ic e s t a t i o n , th e number o f c a rs a rriv in g a t a p a r tic u la r t r a f f i c s ig n a l, and so on. Urban a n a ly s ts , however, tend to be concerned w ith flows between o rig in s and d e stin a tio n s, i . e . , in te rp o in t flow s.
Adequate su rv e illan c e o f urban subsystems w ill req u ire, a t the very le a s t, a w ell-developed methodology fo r q u a n tita tiv e ly describing ex istin g s p a tia l p o in t p a tte r n s and in te r p o in t lin k a g e s .
