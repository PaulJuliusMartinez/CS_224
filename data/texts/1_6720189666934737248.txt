INTRODUCTION: 

Information technology is changing every aspect of our personal, social and professional life. 
Information  technology  has  brought  out  incredible  changes  in  almost  every  aspect  of 
information  services.  Internet  is  becoming  more  and  more  popular  source  among  reference 
librarians  and  users.  It  enables  them  to  search,  retrieve,  request,  receive,  and  download 
information from sources scattered all over the world on the web.  

The library and information professional is also facing the challenges of electronic age. All 
these  developments  gave  way  to  new  range  of  reference  services.  In  this  series  of 
developments digital reference is the latest trend of the digital era. Easily accessible digital 
information has rapidly become one of the hallmarks of internet.  

Reference Service is a personalized service by the library reference staff to individual user in 
making maximum utilization of library resources. It is bridge between library resources and 
users. Some time users are directed to source of information or just guided by the reference 
staff to find out what is where? There are two types of reference service 
•  Ready Range Reference Service/Short Range Reference Service 
•  Long Range Reference Service

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE 
 
Kalra,  Harinder  Pal  Singh.  (2011)  in  his  study  entitled  “DVRS  as  a  catalyst  for 
transforming  L  &  I  services”  reviewed  Digital  and  virtual  reference  services  (DVRS)  have 
been  in  libraries  of  the  developed  world  for  more  than  a  quarter  century  now.  There  have 
been  a  few  experiments  in  India  with  regard  to  provision  of  DVRS,  and  education  and 
training  for  DVRS  for  a  few  years.  In  his  study  researcher  explores  the  need  for  a 
collaborative  effort  by  academic  libraries  in  India  for  digital  and  virtual  reference  services 
.The  researcher  also  briefly  describes  Sandarbh  Soochna:  a  DVRS  training  initiative  at 
Punjabi University. Such efforts are developing qualified and trained manpower that would 
transform  the  L&I  services  scene  by  managing  knowledge  and  information  resources 
effectively in a global electronic village. Trained manpower is the most crucial resource to 
act  as  catalyst  for  knowledge  discovery  and  management  from  diverse  sources.  At  the  end 
researcher concluded that collaborative DVRS, especially among academic libraries in India 
is needed to develop and manage knowledge and information resources effectively to satisfy 
the  five  laws  of  library  science  and  to  meet  the  increasing  demands  of  users’  in  a  global 
electronic village. 
 
Gross, Melissa, Charles R. McClure and Lankes, R. David.(2011) in their paper entitled 
“Costing  Reference:  Issues,  Approaches,  and  Directions  for  Research”  analyzed  the 
Assessing  Quality  in  Digital  Reference  project  is  understand  the  cost  of  digital  reference 
services in libraries.  Costing data is needed for Planning, Cost/benefit analysis, determining 
the effectiveness of service, determining the efficiency of service, determining the allocation 
of resources, Evaluation, Substantiation of funding, determination of fees and Comparison of 
services within and across organizations. The researcher presents three measures isolated by 
project  participants  as  being  most  useful  for  their  immediate  needs:  total  cost  of  providing 
digital  reference  service,  the  cost  of  digital  reference  service  as  a  percent  of  the  total 
reference budget, and the cost of reference as a percent of the total library or organizational 
budget. The researcher reviews selected outstanding issues in the ongoing question of how to 
determine  the  cost  of  reference  services  in  libraries  and  offers  direction  for  further  study 
toward a general cost model for information services. 
 
Sherikar,  Amruth,  Jange,  Suresh  and  Jadhav,  Sanjeev.  (2006)  in  their  article  entitled 
“Digital reference services in the web based Information world” stated that reference service 
has been a cornerstone of the library profession. The development of Internet brings libraries 
new modes of communication and outreach and has extended the scope of reference service

to  Digital  or  Virtual  Reference  services  to  the  users  across  the  world.  They  also  described 
definition  of  digital  reference  service,  planning  and  modes  of  digital  reference  services, 
current  trends  of  digital  reference  service,  reference  and  Information  service  on  the  web, 
search engines of reference service and challenge for digital reference service. The researcher 
suggests the criteria planning and implementing  Digital  Reference  Services  in  an  academic 
and research world. 
 
METHODOLOGY 
 
The  success  of  any  research  depends  upon  the  careful  selection  of  a  suitable  methodology. 
For the purpose of the present study observation method  is used where  websites of all the 
selected University libraries were explored to identify and assess the present status of digital 
reference services provided in the libraries of the selected university. An evaluation criterion 
was used for collecting relevant data from the respective websites of the libraries under study. 
The  data  thus  obtained  were  analyzed,  tabulated  and  interpreted  for  comparing  digital 
reference  services  provided  by  selected  libraries.  Modes  of  digital  reference  service  and 
Online/Digital  Service  criteria  are  selected  for  systematic  evaluation  of  digital  reference 
service in the libraries included in the study.

Digital  Reference  Service  is  an  advancement  of  the  traditional  services  that  is  emerging  as 
natural  solution  to  meet  the  user’s  information  needs  in  the  changing  environment.  The 
digital  library  is  an  electronic  or  virtual  library  where  information  is  selected,  acquired, 
processed, organized, stored and retrieved in digital form. The users of digital libraries are the 
universal  users  who  should  have  facility  to  access  to  all  digital  sources  of  information 
according  to  the  needs  of  users.  Reference  librarians  are  also  using  internet  to  serve  its 
community.  Reference  service  is  extended  beyond  the  physical  library  and  designated 
reference desk hours, opening the building for 24-hour access etc.           
 
ELEMENTS OF DIGITAL REFERENCE SERVICE 
 

•  The user/Client 
•  The information professionals/Librarians 
•  The interface i.e. chat, email and VOIP etc 
•  Electronic resources i.e. electronic or CD-based resources, Web and print resources. 

 
Need of Digital Reference Service 
 

•  To provide individual assistance and instruction. 
•  To provide and maintain an appropriate collection of reference resources,  
•  both print and electronic form. 
•  To assist users locating the best sources of information. 
•  To help in marketing reference resources. 
•  To serve as a public relations representative. 
•  To help in Online Searching. 
•  To help and assist in professional activities for development and growth 
•  To help in referral process, forward the enquiry or provide the user with live  
• 
•  To educate users concerning and research techniques  

links to authoritative websites 

 
Planning for Digital Reference Service 
 

 

•  Evaluating the user’s needs 
•  Making a proper planning 
•  Discuss with other expertise or librarians having experience regarding this 
•  Decide timing of reference service 
•  Decision  about  whether  to  provide  reference  service  through  persons  or  through 

expert system 
IT infrastructure to be managed 

• 
•  Pilot study 
•  Evaluation  
•  Feedback from the user 

 
MODES/ METHODS OF DIGITAL REFERENCE SERVICE 
 
Digital  reference  services  can  be  made  through  e-mail  or  chat.  Libraries  are  also  using  a 
couple of different means of running an e-mail reference service: using basic e-mail or web 
forms. There are also a few different ways of operating a chat reference service: using simple

Vol.2(4), Oct-Dec, 2012 
 
 
chat  software,  web-based  chat  rooms,  and  web  contact  center  software.  Below  is  a  quick 
preview of each of the delivery methods with more detail. 
 
E-mail 
 
E-mail  is  the  most  prevalent  medium  of  digital  reference  service.  e-mail  reference  service 
became  a  popular  service  in  large  research  and  academics  organizations.  User  sends  the 
library an e-mail with a reference query, supplying whatever information he or she feels is 
necessary. The library may reply by e-mail, phone, fax, letter, etc. Now days the WebPages 
of  Libraries  are  coming  with  “Ask  a  Librarian”  option.  Many  libraries  and  information 
centers are extensively using e-mail facility to provide online reference service.    
        
Ask Services 
 
Ask  A  Service  refers  to  web  sites  that  provide  services  such  as  Ask  A  librarian,  Ask  An-
expert,  Ask  A-question  and  Ask  ERIC  in  which  users’  question  are  referred  to  and 
individually  answered  by  people.  Many  Ask  A  Services  provide  online  request  forms  for 
users  to  ask  questions  and  to  provide  information  that  is  usually  obtained  from  an  initial 
reference interview. In Ask A-Question forms, users are asked to provide information as how 
the  sought-for  information  will  be  used,  type  of  answer  accepted  and  sources  already 
consulted.  There  are  many  Ask  A  Services  available  on  the  web  e.g.  Ask  ERIC,  Ask  A 
Question, Ask Me, Virtual Reference Desk, Question Point Service. 
 
Simple Chat Reference 
 
Chat is a very popular means of communication over the internet. Chat Reference enables the 
user  and  the  addressees  (e.g.  reference  librarian  or  other  users)  to  exchange  brief  written 
messages in quick succession. The communicating parties are online at the same time and can 
therefore react  
 
Instant Messaging as a variant of Simple Chat Reference 
 
Instant  Messaging  is  a  variant  form  of  chat  communication  that  has  become  increasingly 
popular. Instant Messaging incorporates various interesting features, but users have to install 
client software to make use of these. Using this software users can create their own address 
lists, so called buddy lists. When a user logs in, it is immediately visible who from that buddy 
list is also online and communication via chat can commence directly. 
 
Chatterbots 
 
Chatterbots  are  created  by  computer  software  which  analyses  the  questions  submitted  by 
users for the keywords contained using linguistic programmes and mechanisms. Ideally, these 
keywords  are  already  linked  to  particular  answers  in  the  knowledge  base  which  are  then 
offered to the user. In this form of digital reference, the user therefore does not communicate 
with  a  librarian  but  instead  an  interactive  database  that  contains  a  range  of  pre-prepared 
information. Chatterbots are technically similar to full-text search engines, but they portray 
the illusion of an online chat: the users enter their queries in the fields provided and receive 
immediate replies. To increase the attractiveness of this service, chatterbots are fitted out with 
a symbolic body, so called avatars, in the form of pictures or animated images.  
 
Video-Conferencing or Web-Cam Services

This form of digital reference includes the visual element, which may be an antidote to the 
communications problems inherent in the more text-based services. Librarians and users are 
able  to  use  both  text  and  speech  for  reference  transactions.  Instead  of  a  window  for  the 
textual exchange, there is a window in which librarians and users can see each other while 
conducting a face-to-face interview. Web or other electronic sources can 'be pushed' to users 
via  another  window.  This  technology  provides  distance  learning,  as  well  as  research  and 
reference  applications.  Challenges  with  this  type  of  service  are  similar  to  those  with  chat 
reference: Staffing, Training, Times for implementing the service,Lack of mobility for staff 
involved with the service and Cost. 
 
VoIP (“Audio-Chat” or Internet Phoning) 
 
Voice  over  Internet  Protocol  (VoIP)  is  a  technology  that  enables  the  transfer  of  voice  and 
other data via the standard internet protocol. In addition to standard hardware equipment both 
parties  need  to  have  speakers  and  microphones  installed  on  their  PCs.  When  both  of  these 
components become standard and their use is a matter of course it is possible that chat turns 
out  to  have  been  an  interim  technology.  Already,  software  that  allows  communication  via 
VoIP and is particularly targeted at digital reference is available on the market.  
 
Web forms 
 
The web form has to be accessed from the library homepage or the reference webpage, the 
fields  then  have  to  be  filled  in  by  the  user  and  the  form  is  finally  submitted  back  to  the 
library. Answers are usually provided by email, phone or post. Web forms consist of a few 
compulsory categories e.g. for personal and contact details and several additional  
 
Web Contact Center 
 
Some libraries are already using Web Contact Center software which has been developed for 
e-commerce applications for digital reference purposes. Web Contact Center offer a variety 
of features. They allow communication via email, web form and chat, but also enable more 
interactive collaboration through tools such as the already mentioned page pushing, escorting 
and co-browsing.  
 
Collaborative Networks for Reference 
 
In this service, two or more libraries team up to offer reference service using any of the above 
online formats. The user would send to a member library his or her request, which would be 
forwarded to the library best able to answer the question. A library may get a question routed 
to it because it has particular strengths in its collection that match the needs of the user. Or a 
member library might get a question routed to it because it happens to be open when the user 
makes his or her request. 
 
User Orientation and Feedback 
 
Recently development of digital reference service has included little consideration of users. 
This lack is in large part due to librarians themselves having to contend with a major service 
shift: even the simple addition of an e-mail address on a web page has provoked time, staff, 
and  service  delivery  issues.  As  more  and  more  librarians  make  the  transition  to  digital 
reference  service,  the  users'  experience  of  the  digital  reference  transaction  receives  more

attention. This attention is resulting in more guidance for users in acceptable use, formulating 
questions,  and  alternative  sources.  In  addition,  librarians  are  seeking  more  feedback  from 
users through email and web surveys.  
 
Bulletin Board Service 
 
The  BBS  is  a  miniature  form  of  an  online  system  for  a  cost-effective  distribution  of 
information in electronic format. BBS supports interactive communication between users on 
a wide variety of subjects ranging from hobbies to politics. 
 
Real-Time Live Web Reference 
 
Real-time  reference  live  on  the  web  is  the  latest  trend  in  virtual  reference.  Already  some 
libraries are providing live web reference services to their users.For example24/7 Reference, 
Live Ref, Know–It-Now Services 
5.14 Online Pathfinder: 
 
Pathfinders  are  guides  designed  to  help  users  find  information  on  a  particular  topic.  With 
more and more information available in electronic format and on the web, online pathfinders 
are  becoming  increasingly  popular.  e.g.  Library  of  congress  (www.loc.gov)  web  site  and 
Internet  Public  Libran  (ipl.org).  For  example:  Library,  Netlibrary,  Internet  Public  Library 
Pathfinders, and Pathfindersonline.org

Online /Digital Service & Various Modes of Digital Reference Service. 
 
*OPAC Service are providing through Intranet within campus of Jammu University. 
 
Online / Digital Service 
 
Online/  Digital  service  is  a  network  of  experts,  intermediation  and  resources  placed  at  the 
disposal  of  someone  seeking  answer  online.  These  services  are  provided  through  Library 
Websites,  Web-OPAC,  Subject  Portals,  Web-database,  Collaboration  with  National  and 
International  Network  and  Links  to  e-resources.    Library  has  own  websites  for  search 
purpose. With the help of Web-OPAC (Online public access catalogue), the users are capable 
to  search  their  required  information  on  line  and  obtain  such  resources  through  electronic 
mode  of  distribution.  Subject  portal  provide  the  information  which  is  related  to  particular 
subject to the user. Web-data base is a collection of information organized in such a way that 
a  computer  program  can  quickly  select  desired  pieces  of  data.  The  collaborative  Digital 
Reference Service (CDRS), operated by the library of congress, is an international network of 
libraries, consortia, museums, Ask a services that uses a help desk system to route questions 
to  appropriate  institutions  based  on  member  profile.  The  growing  popularity  of  electronic 
information resources and the increasing demand of information seekers has necessitated the 
present day libraries to acquire e-resources such as, e-books, e-journals, e-databases, e-thesis, 
standards,  patents  etc.  and  the  links  to  e-resources  provide  a  quick  accessibility  all  these 
resources.

The above figure 3 represents the three libraries i.e. Panjab University, Delhi University and 
Kashmir  University  are  successfully  providing  the  e-mail  reference  service,  but  Central 
library  of  Jammu  University  is  not  providing  e-mail  reference.  Out  of  the  four  selected 
University  libraries,  only  Delhi  University  library  system  is  providing  Ask  a  librarian 
reference service and Question point service.

The  figure  4  reveals  that  the  real  time  reference  service  is  an  active  part  of  the  library  of 
Delhi University. Delhi University library system has made provision only for chat reference 
service.  It  is  surprising  to  note  that  libraries  of  Panjab  University,  Jammu  University  and 
Kashmir University are not providing any form of real time reference service (Chat, Instant 
messaging, VOIP and video via reference) through Internet. 
 
Web form or Query form Service and FAQ Service 
 
In web forms the user fills out an online form on the libraries websites. It structures the user’s 
request in such a way that helps the user in providing additional supply of information that 
will  specify  his/her  request.  The  query  structured  is  submitted  to  the  respective  library  and 
the  person  replying  these  will  post  an  e-mail  reply  to  the  user  immediately.  FAQ  means 
Frequent Ask Question in which librarian give the frequently response to the question raised 
by the user.

University  are  not  providing  the  FAQ  service  to  their  users,  only  Delhi  University  library 
system is using FAQ service. 
 
Web Based Reference Service 
 
Web based reference service included Bulletin board, Web contact centre, search engine, web 
based  user  education  and  user  feed  back  form  etc.  Bulletin  board  is  a  system  that  enables 
users to send or read electronic messages, files, and other data that are of general interest and 
addressed to no particular person. Web Contact Center software which has been developed 
for  e-commerce  applications  and  digital  reference  purposes.  Various  search  engines  also 
provides the reference service. The Library User Education program is designed to provide 
students  with  practical  knowledge  of  research  techniques  and  assist  students  in  becoming 
independent library users. In feedback form the libraries provide an online form for asking 
questions to libraries, librarian, also sending suggestion, views and comment upon the library 
service for building up the service in a more effective way.

Collaborative Reference Service 
  
In this model, two or more libraries team up to offer reference service using any of the online 
formats.  It  includes  union  list  or  union  catalogue  of  Participating  libraries  and  also  takes 
initiation towards providing consortia based resources to the libraries under study for serving 
the users in a better way. Library consortia are offering member libraries the opportunity to 
share reference questions with each other using the internet and other technologies.

FINDINGS, CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS 
 
This  study  is  an  important  first  step  towards  better  understanding  of  how  digital  library 
services can be successfully integrated into existing libraries and information services of the 
selected  university  libraries.  The  systematic  and  careful  study  undertaken  in  this  work 
disclosed the current status of digital reference in the selected university libraries.  
 
The  investigator  is  mentioned  the  important  findings  obtained  from  analysis  and 
interpretation  of  data.  The  study  revealed  that  all  the  four  selected  University  libraries  are 
providing  online  /digital  services  including  Library  Websites,  Web-OPAC,  Subject  Portals, 
Web-Database, Collaboration with National International Network and Links to e-resources. 
In  the  case  of  digital  Reference  service,  the  Reference  Desk  or  a  Help  Desk  Service  is 
providing  by  the  four  selected  libraries.  E-mail  reference  service  is  providing  by  Panjab 
University  Library,  Delhi  University  Library  and  Kashmir  University  Library.  Only  Delhi 
University  library  has  introduced  facility  of  Ask  a  librarian,  Question  Point,  Online  chat, 
FAQ,  Web  based  user  education  and  search  engine  services  to  the  users.  Bulletin  Board 
service is providing by Kashmir University library. It is revealed that all three libraries i.e. 
Delhi University Library, Jammu University Library and Kashmir University are providing 
the User feedback service through e-mail but Panjab University library is not providing User 
feedback  service.  All  selected  libraries  are  providing  the  collaborative  reference  services 
through JCCC@UGC-INFONET: e journal gateway and DELNET etc. 
 
On the basis of personal observation, results obtained and criteria selected for evaluation of 
digital  reference  services,  the  researcher  has  come  to  the  conclusion  that  Central  Library 
System of Delhi University is the best system out of the four libraries in terms of providing 
digital  reference  services.  According  to  results  and  personal  observation  the  researcher  has 
found  that  Delhi  University  Library  is  providing  digital  reference  services(58.82%)  which

Vol.2(4), Oct-Dec, 2012 
 
 
includes Reference desk Service, E-mail,   Ask a librarian ,Question Point Reference Service, 
Chat ,FAQ ,Search Engine Reference Services, Web Based User Education ,User Feedback 
form service and  Collaborative Reference Service. 
 
On the other hand, we cannot ignore the importance of the digital reference services provided 
by  the  three  university  libraries  i.e.  Panjab  University  library,  Jammu  University  Library, 
Kashmir University Library. Panjab University Library is providing the two digital reference 
including Reference Desk Service and E-mail services. Jammu University library is providing 
the two digital reference services i.e. Reference Desk Service and User feedback service and 
Kashmir  University  library  is  providing  four  digital  reference  services  i.e.  Reference  Desk 
Service, E-mail, Bulletin Board and User feedback service.  
 
Thus the researcher concludes that Kashmir University Library is the Second best University 
for  providing  the  digital  reference  services  (29.4%).  Panjab  University  Library  is  the  third 
best  University  which  providing  the  digital  reference  service  (17.64%).  Jammu  University 
Library comes at the fourth number for providing the digital reference services (17.64%). 
 
At last the researcher can say that the four selected university libraries are deeply involved in 
the organization and management of a large number of e-resources to provide various digital 
reference sources to their users under intranet as well as internet environment. Therefore the 
researcher  suggests  that  the  three  libraries  (Panjab  University  Library,  Jammu  University 
Library  and  Kashmir  University  Library)  must  emphasis  on  developing  an  assessment 
technique,  measures,  standards  and  follows  IFLA  and  ALA  guidelines  so  that  they  can 
provide better digital reference service to its users.
