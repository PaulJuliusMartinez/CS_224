During dierentiation in vitro, Embryonic Stem (ES) cells generate both primitive erythroid and de®nitive myeloid lineages in a process that mimics hematopoiesis in the mammalian yolk sac. To investigate leukemic transformation of these embryonic hematopoietic progenitors, we infected dierentiating cultures of ES cells with the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia-speci®c BCR/ABL oncoprotein. Following a period of liquid culture, we isolated two transformed subclones, EB57 and EB67, that retained characteristics of embryonic hematopoietic progenitors and induced a fatal leukemia in mice characterized by massive splenomegaly and granulocytosis. Histopathology of the spleen revealed an abundance of undierentiated blast-like cells. Investigation of the clonal origins of the granulocytes in the peripheral blood demonstrated that the injected donor cells contributed modestly to the granulocyte population while the majority were host-derived. EB57 secretes IL3 and unidenti®ed cytokines that can stimulate autocrine and paracrine cell proliferation, presumably accounting for the reactive granulocytosis in diseased mice. These BCR/ABL transformed hematopoietic derivatives of ES cells recapitulate the relationship of BCR/ABL expression to IL-3 production that has been described for primitive hematopoietic progenitors from human CML patients, and illustrates the potential for autocrine and paracrine eects of BCR/ABL-infected cells in murine models Oncogene (2001) 20, 2636 ± 2646.

Philadelphia chromosome translocation (Ph1) in both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Expression of the BCR/ABL fusion oncoprotein in pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells induces a CML-like disorder in murine model systems, directly implicating BCR/ABL in disease induction (Daley et al., 1990; Gishizky et al., 1993; Li et al., 1999b). BCR/ABL is a pleiotrophic oncogene that alters integrin function, blocks apoptosis and drives proliferation in hematopoietic progenitors. BCR/ABL mimics many aspects of cytokine receptor signaling and activates similar signal transduction pathways, including Ras-Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase, Phosphatidyl inositol-3 Kinase/AKT, and JAK/STAT, among others. BCR/ABL can transform a variety of cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines to factor-independence, leading to the widely held notion that BCR/ABL can functionally complement for many aspects of cytokine signaling (Koh and Daley, 2001). Recently, it was shown that BCR/ABL expression could substitute for the erythropoietin receptor in support of terminal red blood cell development in cells from erythropoietin receptor-de®cient mice, directly demonstrating functional receptor complementation in primary cells (Ghaari et al., 1999).
Though BCR/ABL can readily replace the exogenous cytokines needed for proliferation of hematopoietic cell lines, the role of BCR/ABL in driving cytokine-independent hematopoiesis in human disease has been controversial. Cytokines are required for robust formation of hematopoietic colonies from the bone marrow of CML patients, but some degree of autonomous hematopoiesis in myeloid progenitors has been demonstrated, most consistently for erythroid colony types (Eaves and Eaves, 1979; Issaad and Vainchenker, 1994). Eaves and colleagues have demonstrated cytokine-independent, autonomous proliferation of the most primitive CD34+ progenitors from CML patients, an eect which correlates with autocrine expression of IL-3 and G-CSF (Jiang et al., 2000). Autocrine production of the cytokines is lost in more dierentiated progeny, providing a cogent explanation for why committed progenitors from CML patients remain dependent upon cytokines for hematopoietic colony formation in methylcellulose. These data suggest that autocrine and paracrine

eects of cytokines might play a role in altering progenitor cell dynamics in the bone marrow of CML patients.
Retroviral gene transfer of BCR/ABL into murine bone marrow induces a CML-like myeloproliferative condition, and two independent groups have demonstrated high levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF in the serum of diseased animals (Li et al., 1999b; Zhang and Ren, 1998). However, mice de®cient in IL-3 remain susceptible to CML induction by retroviral transfer of BCR/ABL (Li et al., 1999a), arguing that autocrine stimulation by IL-3 may not be required for disease induction, although autocrine stimulation from other cytokines cannot be excluded as a critical mechanism. BCR/ABL shows variable eects on hematopoietic cell lines in culture, stimulating cytokine release and transformation by an autocrine mechanism in some models, while transforming other cell lines by nonautocrine mechanisms. Given the widely divergent data, the precise role of autocrine cytokine production in CML remains an unsettled issue.
Embryonic Stem (ES) cells have been widely used to study development eects of genetic mutations in mice. In vitro dierentiation of ES cells represents an approachable experimental model for studying the events that occur in the early embryo. When removed from culture conditions that inhibit dierentiation, ES cells aggregate and form cystic embryoid bodies (EBs) that recapitulate aspects of early embryonic development, including the formation of primitive tissues representing all embryonic germ cell layers (Doetschman et al., 1985; Keller, 1995; Wiles and Keller, 1991). Cultured EBs manifest overt hemoglobinization within blood islands that give rise to primitive and de®nitive erythroid cells. In addition, multipotential myeloid progenitors as well as precursors of lymphoid populations can be demonstrated (Gutierrez-Ramos and Palacios, 1992; Keller et al., 1993; Wiles and Keller, 1991). Despite the identi®cation of multipotential progenitors in EBs, it has been dicult to demonstrate ecient hematopoietic reconstitution of irradiated adult mice with EB-derived hematopoietic progenitors. Therefore, to determine whether these progenitors might be subject to leukemic transformation that might enhance engraftment, we infected the cells with a retrovirus carrying BCR/ABL. Here, we describe the isolation of transformed cell lines with features of primitive hematopoietic progenitors that exhibit novel features. When injected into irradiated mice, these cell lines generate an aggressive leukemia characterized by marked organ in®ltration with primitive blasts and peripheral blood granulocytosis; however, the majority of the granulocytes in diseased animals are of host origin. We have demonstrated that the cell lines secrete IL-3 (and perhaps additional cytokines) that likely account for the reactive granulocytosis. The cell lines should be useful for understanding the relationship of BCR/ABL expression and IL-3 production that has been described for primitive hematopoietic progenitors from human CML patients.

Transduction of a BCR/ABL retrovirus into hematopoietic progenitors from mouse embryonic stem cells differentiated in vitro
When cultured as embryoid bodies, ES cells undergo a temporal pattern of dierentiation into multiple diverse tissue types, including hematopoietic development that mimics aspects of yolk sac and embryonic hematopoiesis (Keller et al., 1993; Keller, 1995). We set out to investigate the ability of the BCR/ABL oncogene to transform embryonic hematopoietic progenitors and facilitate their transplantation into irradiated adult mice. Our general strategy for introducing BCR/ABL into dierentiated cultures of ES cells is shown in Figure 1. ES cells were dierentiated as embryoid bodies for 5 days, a time chosen to coincide with the transition between optimal formation of hemangioblast progenitors (BL ± CFC) and the subsequent development of de®nitive multi-potential hematopoietic cells (Choi et al., 1998). Following this period of in vitro dierentiation, we introduced a retrovirus expressing BCR/ABL into ROSA26-derived D3 ES cells. BCR/ABL-infected cells were plated in media supplemented with cytokines (SCF, IL-3 and IL-6) on the M2-10B4 bone marrow stromal cell line that supports the maintenance of primitive hematopoietic stem cell populations (Lemoine et al., 1988). Cells from mock-infected cultures failed to proliferate for signi®cant periods of time under these conditions as demonstrated by a paucity of GFP+ cells detected after 9 days in culture, but abundant semiadherent cells arose in BCR/ABL-infected cultures (Figure 1). BCR/ABL-infected EB-derived cells were maintained in liquid culture on the M2-10B4 stromal cell line, and after 24 days cell populations emerged that could be propagated inde®nitely in the absence of either cytokines or stromal cells. In two experiments, these cells formed exclusively mast cell colony types when plated in methylcellulose, but in a third, compact hematopoietic blast colonies and primitive erythroid colonies were detected. Well-isolated compact blast colonies were picked and expanded in liquid culture into continuously growing cell lines. Two lines, designated EB57 and EB67, were characterized in detail. When replated in methylcellulose, EB57 retained the original compact colony morphology (Figure 2a), while clone EB67 showed a halo of migratory cells on the periphery of the colony (Figure 2b). Both colonies contained predominantly blast-like cells with basophilic cytoplasm, similar to primitive erythroblasts. Clone EB67 contained numerous prominently vacuolated large cells (Figure 2d). No obvious dierentiated myeloid or lymphoid elements were noted.

Figure 1 Schema for derivation of cell lines by retroviral transduction of BCR/ABL into disrupted embryoid bodies. ES cells were dierentiated into embryoid bodies, disrupted after 5 days, and transduced with either the BCR/ABL retrovirus or the empty vector. Infected cells were transferred to irradiated M2-10B4 bone marrow stromal cells in the presence of myeloid cytokines (SCF, IL-3, and IL-6). BCR/ABL-transduced EB cells showed signi®cant growth after 9 days in culture while vector-infected control cultures failed to proliferate, as demonstrated by direct visualization of GFP+ cells by immuno¯uorescence. Following extended periods in liquid culture; cells were plated in methylcellulose and individual colonies were picked and further expanded, giving rise to cell lines. Hematopoietic potential of the EB-derived cell lines was characterized in methylcellulose colony assays and by injection into irradiated mice

lymphoid lineages, including Gr-1, Mac-1, CD61, B220, CD19, CD4, and CD8 (data not shown). Lineage negativity combined with Sca-1 and c-kit positivity are surface antigen features typical of hematopoietic stem cells, but these cells lacked expression of the fetal liver stem cell antigen AA4.1 and were negative for CD34 (Spangrude et al., 1988; van de Rijn et al., 1989). Interestingly, analysis of another surface antigen expressed on early hematopoietic progenitors, Thy-1 (Spangrude et al., 1988), identi®ed a marked dierence between clones EB57 and EB67, as did the expression pro®le for CD18, the common integrin b2 subunit, a surface antigen found on all leukocytes. Clone EB57 did not express signi®cant amounts of Thy1 or CD18, while clone EB67 contained a subpopulation of cells with signi®cant levels of Thy-1 and CD18. Therefore, based on morphology and surface antigen phenotype, the cell line appears to be a very primitive hematopoietic cell type, morphologically resembling the primitive erythroblast lineage.
EB-derived cells exhibit features of primitive erythroid cell differentiation
Cell pellets of the blast cell lines EB57 and EB67 demonstrated a faint pink to red appearance, suggesting erythroid dierentiation. Flow cytometry showed that a small percentage of cells (approximately 5 ± 8%) arising during passage of EB57 and EB67 stained positive for expression of the erythroid surface marker Ter119 (not shown). RT ± PCR was used to analyse globin gene expression in the BCR/ABL-infected blast cells (Figure 4). Both clones EB57 and EB67 expressed embryonic (bH1) and adult globins (b major), similar to fetal liver, but in contrast to adult bone marrow,

which showed expression of only the adult globin locus (b major). These results demonstrate that the BCR/ ABL-infected blast cell lines EB57 and EB67 have features comparable to embryonic yolk sac progenitors, which represent an early stage of embryonic hematopoiesis with a predisposition for dierentiation into primitive erythrocytes.
EB57 and EB67 are subclones of a cell infected with two copies of the BCR/ABL retrovirus
Protein lysates were generated from the cell lines and analysed for BCR/ABL expression by immunoblot analysis using an antibody to c-ABL. EB57 and EB67 expressed BCR/ABL at similar levels (Figure 5a). The amount of BCR/ABL produced was similar to the level expressed in cytokineindependent BCR/ABL-transformed clones of Ba/F3 cells (Klucher et al., 1998). Southern blot analysis was performed to detect the unique sites of retroviral integration using a probe for the puromycin resistance gene carried by the BCR/ABL retrovirus. When digested with HindIII, two identical retroviral integration sites were identi®ed at single copy levels for both cell lines analysed (Figure 5b). Similar results were found using EcoRI restriction digests (data not shown). These results indicate that the cell lines were subclones of a single parental BCR/ABL-infected EB-derived cell that had sustained infection with two retroviruses. The dierences in colony morphology in methycellulose as well as surface antigen expression of EB57 and EB67

suggest that the clones had diverged modestly from one another during propagation in liquid culture. It is likely that extended liquid culture of the BCR/ABLinfected EB cells selected for a secondary genetic event that allowed the emergence of these cytokine-independent clones.

EB-derived, BCR/ABL-transformed clones reconstitute an acute leukemia with granulocytic differentiation
Although EB57 and EB67 cells remained largely undierentiated in liquid culture, we asked whether they might be induced to dierentiate when passaged in the mouse. To test this, ®ve million cells were injected into the tail vein of sub-lethally irradiated mice of either the syngeneic 129 or immune compromised Balb/c nu/nu strains. Both subclones EB57 and EB67 induced disease with a similar pathology. Animals injected with EB57 cells were extensively characterized. With a latency averaging 51 days, mice succumbed to a disease characterized by massive splenomegaly, bone marrow replacement, and

elements (shown for spleen in Figure 6a). Southern analysis of genomic DNA derived from bone marrow and spleen demonstrated 100% donor contribution of the diseased tissues by the EB57 cells (Figure 6b). In contrast, peripheral blood gave less than single copy signal intensity, suggesting a mixture of donor-derived and host cells. Therefore, we analysed the cellular composition of the peripheral blood by ¯ow cytometry. GFP+ donor cells were detected in the peripheral circulation, and staining with the granulocyte marker GR-1 demonstrated a distinct population of donorderived cells expressing low levels of the GR-1 antigen (Figure 7b). Donor-derived GFP+/GR-11o cells were isolated by FACS sorting, centrifuged onto glass slides and stained. These cells had the morphology of immature granulocytes, comparable to cells in the GFP7/GR-1+ population that constituted the majority of cells in the peripheral blood (Figure 7d). Genomic DNA was extracted from these distinct cell populations and processed for PCR analysis. Using primers directed against the BCR/ABL cDNA in the EB57 cells and the ubiquitous b-actin gene as a control, we detected BCR/ABL in both the GFP+/ GR-17 and GFP+/GR-1+ cells (Figure 7c). Therefore, a population of granulocytes in the peripheral blood of the diseased animals was derived from donor EB57 cells, showing their capacity for in vivo dierentiation along the myeloid lineage. However, the majority of the granulocytes in the peripheral blood of the diseased animals were host-derived. The mechanism by which injection of EB57 cells induced granulocytosis was investigated further.
EB57 cells express IL-3 that acts in a paracrine and autocrine manner
We considered the possibility that the EB57 cells were producing a growth factor that would stimulate host granulocyte proliferation through a paracrine eect. RNA was isolated from EB57 cells and used for RT ± PCR expression analysis for cytokines that might aect granulocyte production. The results indicated that EB57 cells expressed the IL-3 mRNA but did not express signi®cant levels of stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, G-CSF or GM-CSF (Figure 8a and data not shown). In a functional assay to detect cytokine production that might mediate a paracrine eect, medium conditioned by growth of EB57 cells was concentrated and shown to sustain growth of BaF3 and 32D cells, which are IL-3dependent lymphoid and myeloid cell lines, respectively (Figure 8b and not shown). Proliferation of BaF3 cells is maximal in medium supplemented with 7.5% conditioned medium (CM) from WEHI-3B cells, a widely used source of IL-3. A titration was carried out to determine that 1 mg/ml of anti-IL-3 antibody represents a saturating dose that completely neutralized 7.5% WEHI-3B CM (data not shown; Daley and Baltimore, 1988). EB57 cells produce signi®cantly less IL-3 than WEHI-3B cells, as 50% EB57 CM supported the proliferation of BaF3 cells

(b) Genomic DNA was isolated from bone marrow (BM), spleen (Spl) and three separate peripheral blood samples (PB1-3) from leukemic mice injected with EB57 cells. Twelve mg of DNA from diseased and normal control tissues and 3, 6 and 12 mg of DNA from the EB57 cell line was digested with EcoRI and hybridized with a Bcr-speci®c probe that identi®es the endogenous murine Bcr gene as well as the BCR/ABL cDNA carried by integrated provirus. By determining BCR/ABL levels, normalized to the respective endogenous Bcr levels, and to the loading controls, samples were compared quantitatively. The spleen and BM of diseased mice were consistently replaced by EB57 cells, while only a minority (between 25 ± 50%) of peripheral blood was donor-derived

less eectively than 7.5% WEHI-3B CM (Figure 8b). Incubation of BaF3 cells with 1 mg/ml neutralizing anti-IL-3 antibody only partially inhibited the growth-promoting activity of EB57 CM. This suggests that while IL-3 was a prominent paracrine cytokine liberated by EB57 cells, other unidenti®ed factors in EB57 conditioned medium also appear to contribute to the growth of BaF3 cells. Incubation of the EB57 cells themselves with 1 mg/ml of the neutralizing anti-IL-3 antibody inhibited their growth by a considerable and consistent extent, suggesting that the IL-3 produced by EB57 cells also acted in an autocrine manner (Figure 8b). However, all proliferation could not be blocked. This inability to neutralize all of the proliferation of EB57 cells by an anti-IL-3 antibody could have several possible explanations (Forsten and Lauenburger, 1992). IL-3 might act on EB57 cells intracellularly, in a manner not subject to inhibition by the antibody present in the growth media. Alternatively, the proliferation of EB57 cells might depend on other autocrine cytokines not identi®ed, or on the BCR/ABL oncoprotein itself. The expression of IL-3 by EB57 cells contributes to the cytokine independent growth

of the EB57 cell line, and represents a possible mechanism to explain the host granulocytosis observed in the diseased mice.
Discussion
In this study we dierentiated ES cells into embryoid bodies, infected the EB-derived hematopoietic progenitors with a retrovirus encoding the BCR/ABL oncoprotein, and isolated stable cell lines. EB57, the best characterized of the cell lines, represents a primitive embryonic hematopoietic progenitor with erythroblastic morphology, expression of embryonic (bH1) globin, and a limited tendency to dierentiate into ter119+ erythroid cells in vitro. Mice transplanted with EB57 cells succumb to an aggressive leukemia characterized by splenomegaly and peripheral granulocytosis. Careful analysis of granulocytes from the peripheral blood of diseased animals demonstrated that a signi®cant minority derived from the injected clone, showing that the EB57 cell line undergoes limited myeloid dierentiation in vivo. However, the majority of granulocytes in diseased animals were host-

BCR/ABL sequences are detected in the EB57 cells and GFP+ populations, including the GR-1+ cells, but not in the GR-1+/GFP7 population that represents host granulocytes.

Both the GFP+ (middle panel) and GFP7 (right panel) populations of cells that stain with the GR-1 antibody have lobulated nuclei characteristic of immature granulocytes, while the GFP+ population of GR-17 cells show a variety of immature blast like cells and basophilic erythroid elements (left panel). Taken together, the GR-1+/GFP7 cells appear to be host-derived granulocytes, while the GR-1+/GFP+ cells appear to be immature granulocytes that have dierentiated from EB57 cells

Figure 8 EB57 cells produce IL-3. (a) RT ± PCR analysis of mRNA from EB57 cells. RNA was isolated from EB57 cells and adult bone marrow (BM) and subjected to RT ± PCR analysis to detect expression of mRNA for several cytokines. EB57 cells cultured with or without exogenous hematopoietic growth factors (+GF and 7GF, respectively) demonstrate the 285 bp fragment predicted for IL-3 mRNA. Genomic DNA (gDNA) is included as a control, and a large fragment of 540 bp is ampli®ed, consistent with the design of the primers across an intron within the murine IL-3 gene. By comparison EB57 cells do not express signi®cant levels of mRNA for stem cell factor (SCF), which can be detected in whole bone marrow (592 bp fragment). Actin primers demonstrate equal ampli®cation of mRNA from all samples (550 bp fragment). (b) Proliferation assay of BaF3 cells grown in either 7.5% WEHI-3B CM or 50% EB57 conditioned medium, EB57 cells, and BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells (BaF3-BCR/ ABL). BaF3 proliferation is normalized to growth in 7.5% WEHI-3B CM, which represents optimal growth conditions. A titration was carried out to determine the amount of anti-IL-3 antibody required to completely neutralize 7.5% WEHI-3B CM (1 mg/ml). BaF3 cells proliferated less robustly when grown in 50% EB57 CM, and incubation with 1 mg/ml anti-IL-3 antibody inhibited approximately 50% of the growth promoting activity. Growth of EB57 cells is modestly inhibited by the IL-3 neutralizing antibody whereas growth of BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells is unaected

derived and therefore reactive in nature. We demonstrated that EB57 cells liberate bioactive quantities of IL-3, which strongly suggests that the granulocytosis results from a tumor-associated paracrine eect. Autocrine production of IL-3 and G-CSF has been demonstrated in CD34+ progenitors of patients with CML, but the precise role of autocrine and paracrine loops in the pathogenesis of this disease remains controversial.
Oncogene

A reactive, host-derived granulocytosis has been observed in mice transplanted with bone marrow infected with the v-ABL oncogene (Scott et al., 1991). However, the mechanism was previously unexplained. An expansion of host granulocytes associated with increased serum levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF was carefully documented in mice transplanted with bone marrow infected by BCR/ABL (Zhang and Ren, 1998).

Together with our data, these results establish the potential for paracrine eects in murine retroviral models of leukemia, and highlight the need for careful pathologic and molecular characterization of cell populations before drawing conclusions that relate speci®c oncoproteins or oncoprotein variants to leukemia phenotypes. We have not observed purulent tissue or abscess formation in diseased mice, nor have we detected bacterial infection by histopathology, but an alternative concern is whether diseased animals manifest a reactive granulocytosis due to infection.
BCR/ABL has been linked to IL-3 expression in both established cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells. BCR/ABL expression in several IL-3-dependent hematopoietic cell lines relieves cytokine dependence in part through stimulation of autocrine production (Elefanty and Cory, 1992; Hariharan et al., 1988; Sirard et al., 1994). However, this property has not been observed in all hematopoietic cell lines (Daley and Baltimore, 1988; Laneuville et al., 1991; Mandanas et al., 1992). In murine FDC-P1 cells, autocrine stimulation of IL-3 has been linked to the src-homology 2 domain (SH2) of BCR/ABL, as deletion of SH2 abrogates autocrine production of IL-3 (Anderson and Mladenovic, 1996). Interestingly, SH2-deleted BCR/ABL can still transform FDC-P1 and BaF3 cells to factor independence, suggesting that autocrine stimulation is not required for tumorigenicity (Ilaria and Van Etten, 1995; Anderson and Mladenovic, 1996). Mice reconstituted with BCR/ABL-transformed bone marrow cells have elevated circulating levels of IL-3 and GM-CSF, implying that autocrine production occurs from infected primary cells (Li et al., 1999b; Zhang and Ren, 1998). Eaves and colleagues demonstrated autocrine production and action of IL-3 and GCSF in primitive CD34+ precursors from CML patients (Jiang et al., 1999). In the latter study, cytokine expression was lost in more dierentiated hematopoietic compartments, providing evidence that the in¯uence of BCR/ABL on IL-3 expression is dependent on cell context and stage of development. A strain of mice de®cient in IL-3 by gene disruption develops a CML-like myeloproliferative disorder following retroviral infection of bone marrow with a BCR/ABL-expressing retrovirus (Li et al., 1999a). While this observation calls into question the role of autocrine production of IL-3 in CML, it leaves open the possibility that other cytokines might be critical autocrine factors.
EB57 and EB67 are embryonic hematopoietic progenitors that mimic the expression of IL-3 by primitive CD34+ progenitors from CML patients (Jiang et al., 1999). Incubation of the EB57 cell line with a neutralizing anti-IL-3 antibody signi®cantly attenuates but does not completely eliminate proliferation, nor does the antibody eliminate all of the growth promoting activity for BaF3 cells of conditioned medium from EB57 cells. This suggests that EB57 might liberate additional growth factors to account for autocrine and paracrine growth eects, though we have ruled out several obvious candidates like G-CSF and

GM-CSF. When plated in methylcellulose without growth factors, EB57 cells form factor-independent colonies consisting of primitive hematopoietic blasts. Exposure to 1 mM of the ABL kinase blocker STI-571 completely inhibits the formation of these colonies. However, addition of myeloid cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, SCF and EPO) to these methylcellulose cultures rescues 50% of the hematopoietic colony forming activity of EB57 cells grown in STI-571 (data not shown). These observations link the BCR/ABL kinase activity to the cytokine independent growth of EB57 cells, and suggest that autocrine stimulation is dependent upon expression of BCR/ABL.
While the cell lines described herein provide important reagents for studying the interplay between BCR/ABL and autocrine and paracrine stimulation of cell proliferation in leukemia, our initial goal in these experiments was to determine whether BCR/ABL infection of EB cells might generate a CML-like disease in irradiated mice. However, injection of EBderived cells immediately after retroviral infection led to early death in mice due to tumors caused by undierentiated ES cells that persist at low levels in the EB cultures. This prompted us to incorporate a period of bulk liquid culture to eliminate undierentiated ES cells and expand hematopoietic cells prior to transplantation of mice. Mast cells predominated in some cultures, likely because the growth medium was supplemented with SCF (also known as Mast Cell Growth Factor), while hematopoietic blast cells dominated other cultures, allowing us to isolate EB57 and EB67. These cell lines harbored identical retroviral integrations and therefore resulted from infection of a single cell. Clonality implies that a second genetic event occurred during accommodation of these cells to culture. Because EB57 cells fail to contribute signi®cantly to lymphoid (B220+) or erythroid (ter119+) populations in vivo, these hypothetical mutations might also limit dierentiation and account for the acute leukemia observed in the mice. EB57 and EB67 share some features with embryonic hematopoietic cell lines that result from expression of the Hox11 gene in embryoid bodies (Keller et al., 1998). Certain Hox11transformed lines demonstrate primitive and de®nitive erythroid potential, supporting the origin of these lineages from a common precursor in embryonic life, while others manifest only de®nitive myelo-erythroid potential. Further work using oncoproteins to selectively expand and in some cases immortalize cells from EBs should be helpful in de®ning the speci®c developmental potential of progenitors within the embryonic hematopoietic hierarchy. In more recent experiments with BCR/ABL-infected EB cells maintained for only brief periods in culture, we have isolated clones that exhibit signi®cant multi-lineage lymphoid-myeloid dierentiation in irradiated mice (Perlingeiro et al. 2001, submitted). This raises the possibility that clonogenic progenitors in EB cultures, including pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells akin to adult bone-marrow stem cells, are rare cell types that can be targeted by retroviral infection.

Materials and methods

In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells
Murine D3 (ROSA) cells were maintained on gelatinized plates in DMEM, 15% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 150 mM monothioglycerol and 1000 U/ml LIF (Amgen) in the absence of feeder cells for up to 20 passages. ES cells were treated with trypsin (0.25%)/EDTA (1 mM) to form a single-cell suspension. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buered saline and suspended in IMDM at 105 cells/ml. To initiate dierentiation into embryoid bodies (EBs), dissociated ES cells were added to 0.9% methylcellulose medium (M4100ES, Stem Cell Technologies), 15% FBS (HCC6900, Stem Cell Technologies), 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 200 mg/ml iron-saturated transferrin (Sigma), 5 ng/ml Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (R&D Systems), 100 ng/ ml Stem Cell Factor (Amgen), 5 ng/ml basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (Genzyme) and 450 mM monothioglycerol (Sigma) at a cell concentration of 8000 ± 16 000 cells/ml and plated in 30 mm petri dishes. In some experiments, growth factors were omitted; in others, methycellulose medium was replaced with IMDM for liquid EB culture.

Retroviral infection and EB cell culture
A BCR/ABL cDNA coding for the 210 kDa phosphoprotein was cloned into MSCVpac or pMSCViresGFP. Retroviral constructs were transfected into Phoenix cells (Kinsella and Nolan, 1996) using a calcium phosphate precipitate. Supernatant containing retrovirus was collected 48 h post transfection and ®ltered through a 0.45 micron ®lter prior to use. EB cells were collected at 5 days post dierentiation, washed in phosphate-buered saline and treated with 0.25% collagenase (Sigma) for 90 min at 378C. EBs were disrupted to single cells by repeated resuspension. Approximately 105 cells were suspended in 5 ml viral supernatant supplemented with 50 ng/ml hIL6 (Amgen), 0.5 ng/ml mIL3, 50 ng/ml hSCF and 4 mg/ml polybrene. Mock-infected cultures in which viral supernatant was replaced with cell culture medium served as negative control in some experiments. Infected cells were transferred to pre-plated M2-10B4 stromal cells irradiated with 3000 cGy prior to use (Dexter et al., 1984). After 6 h EB cells were removed, centrifuged, suspended in fresh viral supernatant or medium and replated onto the irradiated M210B4 stromal cells. EB cells were removed 18 h post second infection, centrifuged, suspended in IMDM, 20% FBS, 0.5 ng/ml mIL3, 50 ng/ml hIL6, 50 ng/ml hSCF and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol and replated onto the irradiated M2-10B4 stroma cells. Followiing retroviral infection, EB cells were cultured on M2-10B4 stroma for 24 days and then nonadherent cells were plated in methylcellulose medium containing SCF, mIL3, hIL6 and erythropoietin (Stem Cell Technologies, M3434). Individual colonies with a primitive blast-like morphology were isolated and expanded in liquid culture in IMDM, 20% FBS, 0.5 ng/ml mIL3, 50 ng/ml hIL6, 50 ng/ml hSCF and 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol.
To facilitate their identi®cation in vivo, the EB57 clone (derived by infection with MSCVP210pac) was infected with a retrovirus expressing GFP as described above. After several days, EB57 cells expressing GFP were isolated by ¯ow cytometric sorting (FACS).

speci®cations (Stem Cell Technologies). Individual colonies were picked, centrifuged onto glass slides, and stained with hematopoietic stain (Leukostat, Fisher Scienti®c) for morphologic interpretation.
Flow cytometry
We employed biotinylated antibodies to Sca-1, c-Kit, CD34 and CD45; phycoerythrin-conjugated IgG2, CD18, Thy-1, CD44, Ter119, Flk-1, CD8 and streptavidin; FITC-conjugated IgG, CD31, CD4, Gr-1, B220, CD19 and CD61 (Pharmingen). 106 cells were washed once in blocking buer (PBS with 1% FBS), suspended at 107 cells/ml in blocking buer containing 0.25 mg/106 cells Fc Block (Pharmingen) and placed on ice for 5 min. Antibody was added at 1 mg/ 106 cells and incubated at 48C for 30 min prior to washing with blocking buer. Biotinylated antibodies were then counter-stained with PE-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min at 48C followed by washing with blocking buer. Stained cells were analysed on a FACScan cytometer (BectonDickinson).
Protein and molecular analysis
Immunoblotting for detection of ABL proteins has been described (Klucher et al., 1998). For analysis of DNA by Southern hybridization, genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from cell populations or tissues by digestion in lysis buer (100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaC1, 100 mg/ml Proteinase K) for 4 h at 378C followed by ispropanol precipitation. Precipitated gDNA was suspended in Tris-EDTA buer and 10 mg was digested with either HindIII or EcorRI. Digested DNA fragments were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes in 0.4 N NaOH following 0.25 M HC1 acid hydrolysis. A HindIII ± NheI restriction fragment containing the puromycin resistance gene from MSCVpac was radioactively labeled with g-32P-dCTP using the Prime-It II random priming kit (Statagene). Following hybridization at 658C overnight in hybridization buer (0.5 M NaPi, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA), blots were washed three times at 658C in 0.16 SSC, 0.1% SDS and visualized by autoradiography.
To assess contributions of the EB57 cell line to hematopoietic tissues and nucleated peripheral blood cells in mice, gDNA was extracted and analysed by Southern hybridization. A Stu ± Fst restriction fragment from the BCR region of the BCR/ABL cDNA was 32P-labeled by random priming. Upon digestion of gDNA from diseased tissues with EcoRI, this probe detected two fragments; one corresponding to the endogenous cellular BCR, the other from the BCR cDNA sequences carried by the integrated BCR/ABL retrovirus. Because murine and human BCR sequences are highly homologous (495%) the probe could be used to estimate the normalized per cent reconstitution with EB57 cells.
Total RNA was isolated from clonal cell populations using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test `B', Inc., Friendswood, TX, USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. First strand cDNA was produced using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco). One mg of total RNA was hybridized with 140 ng random hexamers in ®rst strand reverse transcriptase buer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 75 mM KC1, 3 mM MgC12, 10 mM DTT, 500 mM dNTPs) followed by addition of 200 U Superscript II reverse transcriptase and incubation at 428C for 50 min. Five per cent of ®rst strand reaction was used for each ensuing PCR reaction.
Primers for RT ± PCR analysis of globins and HPRT are given in (Keller et al., 1993) and for BCR/ABL in (Cross et

al., 1994). Primers for cytokines included: IL-3 (TCAGACTTTAGGTGCTCTGC and TCGTGGAAAGCCAAGGAGAA); SCF (GACTGTGTGCTCTCTTCAAC and CTTGCAAAACCTCCAGAGAGTC); TPO (GACACACGGACCTGTGAATG and AGAGTTAGGCATGGTGGTGG); G-CSF (CTCAACTTTCTGCCCAGAGG and AGCTGGCTTAGGCACTGTGT); GM-CSF (GGATAATTGTTACCCGGCCT and GAAGCTGGATTCAGAGCTGG).
Proliferation assay in liquid culture
IL-3 dependent BaF3 cells were grown in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum and 7.5% WEHI-3B conditioned medium (CM) as a source of IL-3 (Daley and Baltimore, 1988). BaF3 cells also proliferated, but less robustly, in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50% EB57 CM. To determine the proliferation rate of BaF3 cells in the respective medium, 100 mL of a 16105 cells/ml dilution was aliquoted into separate wells of a 96 well plate (10 000 cells/well). Proliferation was assessed after 48 h using the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent as speci®ed by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Absorbance was measured using an Analyst AD microtiter plate reader and Criterion Host software (LJL BioSystems) at 450 nm wavelength. IL-3 activity was demonstrated in conditioned medium from WEHI-3B and EB57 cells by incubation with a neutralizing antibody against IL-3 (anti-mIL-3, R&D Systems, Inc.). A titration was carried out as described (Daley and Baltimore, 1988) to determine that 1 mg/ml of the neutralizing anti-IL-3 antibody completely inhibited the proliferation of BaF3 cells in medium supplemented with 7.5% WEHI-3B CM (representing optimal growth conditions for the BaF3 cell line). CM from the EB57 cell line was concentrated on a cellulose column (Centricon YM-10, Millipore) and added to BaF3 cells at a concentration equivalent to 50% of the total volume. BaF3 and EB57 cells were grown in medium with or without IL-3 neutralizing antibody and proliferation was

assessed as described above. BCR/ABL-transformed BaF3 cells, which are IL-3 independent, were also incubated with IL-3 neutralizing antibody as negative control for nonspeci®c growth inhibitory eects.

Animals
In vivo analysis of EB57 hematopoietic dierentiation was assessed by injecting ®ve million EB57 intravenously into sublethally irradiated (400 or 500 cGy) 4 ± 6-week-old 129 or Balb/c nu/nu mice (Jackson Laboratories). Mice were monitored daily for signs of clinical deterioration. Morbidity was re¯ected by reduced body weight, reduced body temperature, decreased activity, hunched posture and decreased grooming. Peripheral blood was collected by retroorbital venous sinus sampling Moribund animals were sacri®ced and analysed by necropsy. Leukocytes were puri®ed using red blood cell lysis buer (Sigma) and granulocytes were isolated by centrifugation through Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma). Spleens were dissected, weighed and minced to prepare single-cell suspensions. Femur and tibia were dissected and bone marrow (BM) cells were harvested in PBS by including pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells akin to adult bone-marrow stem cells, are rare cell types that can be targeted by retroviral infection.
