The Modern Ideal of Autonomy

1.1.

Introduction

In  contemporary  society  there  are  many  different  views  of  what  an
ideal person is. As I said in the preface, by ‘ideal person’ I mean the
sort of person we wish to be, we aspire to. One of those ideals seems to
be  dominant:  the  ideal  of  a  person  which  I  roughly  deﬁne  as  ‘the
autonomous person’. Most of us want to be, and to be seen as, beings
that (are able to) govern themselves and their lives. We do not like
other people telling us what to do, want, or be. We wish to (be able to)
evaluate, decide, and do what we want. Moreover, this ideal is often
linked to the belief that being autonomous is precisely being a person
in  the  fullest  sense  of  that  word:  if  we  attain  autonomy,  we  realise
ourselves as persons. The personal wish to have the capacity of, and to
be in the state of, autonomy, is then also the wish to be a fully realised
person. For example, if I wish to decide myself about which profession
to take up, I may argue that as a person I have the capacity to make
this  decision  myself,  and  that  if  I  get  the  opportunity  to  use  this
capacity I get the chance to realise myself as a person in the sense of
becoming  more  fully  a  person.  Thus,  the  ideal  of  the  autonomous
person is a claim about what we are and ought to be. 

The ideal of autonomy is present in contemporary philosophical dis-
cussions.  Its  presence  as  an  ideal  in  the  literature  on  autonomy is
widely recognised. For example, in Harm to Self 1 (1986) Feinberg distin-
guishes between four meanings of autonomy,2 autonomy as an ideal
being one of them. However, the ideal also appears in discussions of
related issues, and of freedom in particular. Whether it is expressed
explicitly or not, discussions about freedom often illuminate the ideal
of the autonomous person. Whether in discussions of freedom, free

3

will, or the nature of persons, we can identify a dominant normative
position on what a person should be (i.e. an ideal of a person) that is
either  directly  present  in  the  discussion  or  indirectly  motivates  the
arguments and the underlying assumptions. This can be illustrated by
looking at the following inﬂuential contributions to recent philosophi-
cal  discussions  of  freedom:  Isaiah  Berlin’s  distinction  between  two
kinds of liberty, Christman’s and Feinberg’s deﬁnitions of autonomy,
Harry  Frankfurt’s  hierarchical  model  of  the  volitional  structure  of  a
person, and Charles Taylor’s concept of ‘strong evaluation’. I will use
the ideas of these contemporary authors to outline the modern ideal of
the autonomous person. 

My  answer  to  the  question  ‘What  do  we  mean  if  we  say  that  we
aspire to be autonomous persons?’ will constitute the ﬁrst step in the
dialectical structure of my argument in Part I: the thesis. 

1.2. Berlin, Christman, and Feinberg

In  his  famous  essay  ‘Two  Concepts  of  Liberty’  (1958),  Isaiah  Berlin
distinguishes  two  senses  of  freedom  or  liberty  (he  uses  both  words
interchangeably). He ﬁrst characterises a ‘negative’ sense as an ‘answer
to the question “What is the area within which the subject – a person
or group of persons – is or should be left to do or be what he is able to
do or be, without interference by other persons?”’. Secondly, he devel-
ops a ‘positive’ sense as an ‘answer to the question “What, or who, is
the source of control or interference that can determine someone to
do, or be, this rather than that?”’ (Berlin 1997 (1958): 194). Of the two
senses,  the  ‘positive’  sense  of  freedom  is  particularly  revealing  with
regard to the content of the contemporary ideal of autonomy: 

The ‘positive’ sense of the word ‘liberty’ derives from the wish on
the part of the individual to be his own master. I wish my life and
decisions to depend on myself, not on external forces of whatever
kind. I wish to be the instrument of my own, not of other men’s,
acts of will. I wish to be a subject, not an object; to be moved by
reasons, by conscious purposes, which are my own, not by causes
which affect me, as it were, from outside. I wish to be somebody,
not nobody; a doer – deciding, not being decided for, self-directed
and not acted upon by external nature or by other men as if I were
a thing, or an animal, or a slave incapable of playing a human role,
that is, of conceiving goals and policies of my own and realising
them.  This  is  at  least  part  of  what  I  mean  when  I  say  that  I  am

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 5

rational, and that it is my reason that distinguishes me as a human
being from the rest of the world. I wish, above all, to be conscious
of myself as a thinking, willing, active being, bearing responsibility
for my choices and able to explain them by reference to my own
ideas and purposes. I feel free to the degree that I believe this to be
true, and enslaved to the degree that I am made to realise that it is
not. (Berlin 1997 (1958): 203)

One of the ﬁrst things we notice about this passage is Berlin’s repeated
reference  to  the  wish  on  the  part  of  the  individual  to  be  his3 own
master,  a  subject,  a  willing,  active  being.  This  reference  to  wishes
indicates that to be this kind of individual is thought to be an ideal,
something the individual wishes and aspires to be(come). Secondly, we
can see that the ideal Berlin describes is an ideal of autonomy because it
captures what Christman calls the ‘core’ meaning of autonomy. This is
the  meaning  Feinberg’s  distinct  conceptions  centre  on:  ‘the  actual
condition of autonomy deﬁned as a psychological ability to be self-
governing’ (Christman 1989: 5). In other words, Berlin’s conception of
‘positive’ freedom presents us with an excellent picture of the ideal of a
person as an autonomous individual; and it is precisely this ideal that
is dominant in the literature. Berlin’s description of ‘positive’ freedom
suggests that discussions about autonomy focus on questions about the
source  of  control  and  determination.  The  ideal  of  the  autonomous
individual suggests the following answer: the source should be me, and
not something or somebody else. I should determine myself; not some-
thing or somebody else. In other words, I exemplify this ideal of what a
person should be when I am this autonomous individual, when the
source of my action and my thought is me, when I determine myself as
an individual. What we mean when we call this an ‘ideal’ is simply
that it is a state or condition to which an individual should aspire. In
his  essay  ‘The  Idea  of  a  Free  Man’  Feinberg  puts  it  like  this:  ‘I  am
autonomous if I rule me, and no one else rules I’ (Feinberg 1973: 161).
This  is  the  core  content  of  the  ideal  of  a  person  present  in  Berlin’s
more elaborated description. 

1.3.

Frankfurt

If we say that we want to be self-determining, part of what we mean
is that we (want to) see ourselves as different from ‘the world’ with
its deterministic character; if we understand the world as fully deter-
mined by the laws of science, we want to say that we’re different

6 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

from that world since we have a free will. In ‘Freedom of the Will
and the Concept of a Person’ (1971) Frankfurt identiﬁes one essen-
tial difference between persons and other creatures in the structure
of the person’s will: persons are able to form second-order desires.
‘Besides wanting and choosing and being moved to do this or that,
men  may  also  want  to  have  (or  not  to  have)  certain  desires  and
motives. They are capable of wanting to be different, in their prefer-
ences and purposes, from what they are’ (Frankfurt 1982 (1971): 82).
Frankfurt then makes a distinction between two different kinds of
agents: persons and wantons. Frankfurt uses the term ‘wanton’ to
refer to an agent who does not care about his will. This means that
‘his desires move him to do certain things, without its being true of
him either that he wants to be moved by those desires or that he
prefers to be moved by other desires’ (Frankfurt 1982 (1971): 86).
The key difference between persons and wantons is that although
wantons may have second-order desires (to want to have a certain
desire), only persons are able to form what Frankfurt calls second-
order volitions: the person ‘wants a certain desire to be his will’ and,
as  I  interpret  this  requirement,  succeeds  in  having  that  will
(Frankfurt 1982 (1971): 86). A person is able to do this only in virtue
of  his  rational  capacities.  ‘For  it  is  only  in  virtue  of  his  rational
capacities that a person is capable of becoming critically aware of his
own will and of forming volitions of the second order. The structure
of  a  person’s  will  presupposes,  accordingly,  that  he  is  a  rational
being’ (Frankfurt 1982 (1971): 87). 

Whether Frankfurt’s distinction between second-order desires and
second-order volitions (and therefore between wantons and persons) is
convincing or not,4 it is clear that his discussion embodies a certain
ideal of a person. For many of us, Frankfurt’s account of a person is not
only  a  description  of  what  persons  essentially  are (that  is,  we  agree
with his view about what persons are); it is also an ideal by which we
wish  to  live  as  persons.  We  want  to  be  able  to  decide  whether  we
endorse  a  ﬁrst-order  desire  or  not,  we  want  to  be  able  to  choose
between various (ﬁrst-order) desires. We want to ‘want a certain desire
to be our will’ and succeed in having that will (Frankfurt 1982 (1971):
86).  We  want  to  succeed,  not  just  want;  we  want  to  be  in  control.
Otherwise,  to  use  Frankfurt’s  terminology,  we  are  a  wanton,  not  a
person,  and  this  we  do  not  wish  to  be.  We  place  a  high  value  on
persons in Frankfurt’s sense – we value the idea of a self-determining
individual able to form higher-order desires and govern his ﬁrst-order
desires by them. 

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 7

1.4. Taylor

Charles Taylor goes further than Frankfurt in arguing that persons not
only have the capacity to question their (ﬁrst-order) desires, but also
the capacity to question themselves. In ‘Responsibility for Self’ (1976)
he argues that 

if we think of what we are as deﬁned by our goals, by what we desire
to encompass or maintain, then a person on this view is one who can
raise the question: Do I really want to be what I now am? (i.e. have
the desires and goals I now have?) In other words, beyond the de facto
characterisation of the subject by his goals, desires, and purposes, a
person is a subject who can pose the de jure question: is this the kind
of being I ought to be, or really want to be? (Taylor 1976: 111)

This passage speciﬁes Taylor’s conception of the ideal of a person: that
he should ask himself whether this is the kind of individual he ought
to be, or really wants to be. We not only have the capacity to ask these
questions; many believe (exercising) this capacity is essential to what
we are. Taylor claims that ‘we have the notion that human subjects are
capable of evaluating what they are’ and that ‘many’ believe this kind
of evaluation to be ‘essential to our notion of the self’ (Taylor 1976:
112). According to Taylor, we as a matter of fact make judgements and
‘strong’ evaluations. We do not just evaluate what to do in the sense
that we desire to do this rather than that, but we also evaluate whether
it’s  good  or  not  to  have  this  desire.  Taylor  distinguishes  between
‘someone who evaluates non-qualitatively, that is, makes decisions like
that  of  eating  now  or  later,  taking  a  holiday  in  the  north  or  in  the
south’ and someone who ‘deploys a language of evaluative contrasts
ranging over desires’. Taylor refers to the latter type of a person as a
‘strong evaluator’ (Taylor 1976: 116). He argues that the capacity for
strong  evaluation  is  ‘an  essential  characteristic  of  a  person’,  since
beings  other  than  persons  (such  as  animals)  are  either  incapable  of
evaluating desires or are only able to evaluate as ‘a simple weigher’
(Taylor 1976: 117–18).

Taylor’s idea of strong evaluation is compatible with Frankfurt’s idea
of higher-order desires. In particular, the capacity to question whether
I am now the person I really want to be can manifest itself in the for-
mation  of  higher-order  desires,  such  as  the  desire  to  be  a  different
person. In Frankfurt’s volitional account this amounts to the desire to
have a different volitional structure.

8 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

Taylor explicitly refers to something like ‘ideals of a person’. He sug-
gests that such ideals are operative in making ‘strong’ evaluations: we
aspire to be a certain kind of person, and this inﬂuences our evalu-
ations, our judgements. In particular, Taylor describes the following
ideal: we should be a concerned person, concerned about the issues
touching the quality of our lives which seem to us basic or important
(Taylor  1976:  117).  In  the  light  of  the  question  of  autonomy,  this
means that we should be self-determining in the second aspect I distin-
guished in my introduction: we should be masters of our lives. The
suggestion is that I should evaluate myself on the level of my life as a
whole; I should question the way I live my life, the choices I make, the
things I do. Taylor’s account, therefore, adds to what we already know
from Frankfurt’s. To exercise my capacity to determine my life means
that I make ‘strong’ evaluations. Strong, because I do not just classify a
certain (ﬁrst-order) desire as good or bad, but I question myself as a
certain kind of person. Taylor calls this questioning of the self ‘radical
evaluation’, a ‘reﬂection about the self’ which ‘engages the self most
wholly and deeply’; at stake here is my identity (Taylor 1976: 126).

1.5.

Further reﬁnements

In the beginning of this chapter I claimed that autonomy is nowadays
a very inﬂuential ideal in the sense that it is something many of us
aspire to, and that many believe autonomy is a capacity of persons
(alone)  which  needs  to  be  exercised  if  we  want  to  be  fully  realised
persons. It is not my purpose here to establish the empirical validity of
this claim; others are welcome to challenge it if they wish. Even if it
were to turn out less important than I assume here, most readers will
agree  with  me  that  (the  ideal  of)  autonomy  is  at  least  of  sufﬁcient
importance  and  inﬂuence  in  contemporary  Western  society  and
culture  to  merit  and  motivate  extensive  philosophical  analysis  and
reﬂection. 

What  is  autonomy?  So  far  I  have  used  ‘autonomy’  to  refer  to  the
capacity and exercise of self-control and self-government, of deciding
yourself about your desires and your life. I have said that this involves
questioning and evaluating your desires, yourself, your identity. But
much of what has been said raises questions. Firstly, we could consider
some broad questions about autonomy. What does it mean to say that
a person decides about his life? Is the ideal of autonomy meaningful if
we have little or no options available to us? Is autonomy a capacity or
an achievement? What about autonomy as a political concept? Does

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 9

self-government  mean  that  I  can  do  what  I  want?  How  does  an
autonomous person relate to other (autonomous) persons? And what is
the  relation  between  autonomy  and  morality?  Secondly,  there  are
more  speciﬁc  questions  about  my  interpretation  of  Frankfurt  and
Taylor. For example, the reader may wonder what it means ‘to want a
certain desire to be your will’ or ‘to question your identity’. Many of
the  latter  sort  of  questions  will  receive  further  clariﬁcation  in  the
course of the book, in particular in the sections on Frankfurt. The ﬁrst
broader questions I will consider now. I will not be able to fully answer
them  here,  but  they  will  help  me  to  reﬁne  my  construction  of  the
modern ideal of autonomy. Consider the following distinctions and
points of clariﬁcation.

1.5.1. My desires and my life
I would ﬁrst like to make a distinction between two senses of ‘self-
government’,  which,  recall,  Christman  identiﬁes  as  the  core
meaning of autonomy. To start mapping the area where the notion
of self-government is applicable, we can make a distinction between,
on the one hand, the issue of who is in control or who determines
my desires, and, on the other hand, the issue of who is in control of
or who determines my life as a whole. Discussions of freedom typi-
cally  relate  to  both  aspects.  For  example,  Frankfurt  claims  that
freedom requires, as we have seen earlier, the ability to form second-
order desires: ‘Besides wanting and choosing and being moved to do
this  or  that,  men  may  also  want  to  have  (or  not  to  have)  certain
desires and motives. They are capable of wanting to be different, in
their preferences and purposes, from what they are’ (Frankfurt 1971:
82–3). This can be understood as the exercise of control over a ﬁrst-
order  desire,  or  as  making  a  choice  between  two  conﬂicting  ﬁrst-
order desires. But the result of such exercise(s) may extend beyond
the present moment. If I change my preferences and purposes, my
actions will probably change as well, and therefore the course of my
life may change. Thus, the above distinction between control over
my desires and control over my life concerns the range of the effect
of  the  exercise  of  control  or  choice.  The  effect  may  be  limited  in
time, for example, to this very moment when I decide to control my
desire to eat, or may extend to my life as a whole, when the inter-
play  between  my  desires  of  a  higher  order  and  my  ﬁrst-order
desire(s)  results  in  an  effective  change  in  the  course  of  my  life.  It
gives us a more complete picture of the content of the ideal to dis-
tinguish  between  the  ideal  of  a  person  controlling  his  present

10 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

desires, on the one hand, and the ideal of a person directing his life.
This second aspect of the ideal of a person dominant in our society
and culture is at least as much present in the literature as are discus-
sions of self-control in the more limited sense just deﬁned. It is held,
for example, that for a person to direct his life it is good (ideal) to
have plenty of options available. 

1.5.2. The ideal of having many alternatives
The ideal of having plenty of options available is different from the
ideal  of  autonomy,  since  it  is  more  concerned  with  the  setting  or
context  in  which  the  person  is  choosing  and  acting.  However,  it
shows concern with self-direction as the direction of one’s life as a
whole.  In  ‘On  the  Necessity  of  Ideals’,  Frankfurt  writes  that  ‘our
culture places a very high value on a certain ideal of freedom accord-
ing to which a person is to have varied alternatives available in the
design and conduct of his life’ (Frankfurt 1999: 108). Firstly, although
he writes about an ideal of freedom, it seems clear that this ideal of
freedom is closely linked to the ideal of a person: one who has many
options. It seems that when the ideal of having many options avail-
able is realised, the pursuit of the ideal to design and conduct one’s
own  life  becomes  more  meaningful.  After  all,  if  we  have  but  one
option available, we arguably have no real ‘option’ at all, and there is
nothing left to design or to conduct for oneself. Therefore, the ideal of
designing one’s own life presupposes the availability of alternatives,
and, ideally, many of them. Secondly, Frankfurt is suggesting that this
ideal of freedom – and therefore also this ideal of a person – is indeed
an ideal, or at least a very inﬂuential idea in society: our culture places
‘a very high value’ on it. 

1.5.3. Capacity and condition; political autonomy
Furthermore, using Feinberg’s distinction between the capacity for self-
government and the actual state or condition of self-government,5 we
could make a distinction between the ideal of having the capacity to
govern oneself, on the one hand, and the ideal of being in a state or
condition of self-government, on the other hand. A person who aspires
to be autonomous might refer to the capacity, the condition, or both.
Finally, it is also possible that the person aspiring to be autonomous
refers  to  what  we  may  call  ‘political’  autonomy,  which  means  the
government of one’s own ‘domain’ (Feinberg 1986: 28). I take this to
refer  to  self-government  as  a  person,  being  able  to  choose  and  act
within a certain sphere, comparable with what it means for a state to

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 11

be  autonomous.  Although  the  latter  meaning  will  not  be  completely
excluded (as Feinberg observes: the different meanings of autonomy are
closely related), the primary object of this study is the ideal of autonomy
in the ﬁrst two meanings, the ideal of having the capacity to govern
oneself, and the ideal of being in the condition of actually governing
oneself. My discussion will make further reﬁnement necessary, but at
present I shall hold on to this distinction.

1.5.4. The ideal of ‘doing what you want’
If I have been speaking of the dominant modern ideal, this may mis-
leadingly suggest that this ideal is so overwhelmingly dominant that
there is little room for other modern ideals. It seems to me that there is
at least one other ideal which is perhaps not dominant but deserves
our consideration since it could be considered as a ‘rival’ ideal. In addi-
tion to the dominant modern ideal of a person as an autonomous indi-
vidual  I  have  articulated  so  far,  there  is  the  modern  ideal  of  an
individual  who  has  the  capacity  to  do,  and  is  in  the  condition  of
doing, whatever he wants to do. I shall refer to the latter ideal as ‘the
ideal of doing what you want’, ‘doing what you want’ meaning unlim-
ited  freedom  of  action.  This  ideal  is  arguably  not  less  inﬂuential  in
modern society than the former, has been present and popular in pre-
modern times too, and has been subject to criticism throughout the
history of human thought. I shall maintain that there is a clear distinc-
tion between the dominant ideal of a person as someone choosing and
acting as an autonomous individual and the ideal of ‘doing what you
want’.  There  are  two  main  sources  to  a  denial  of  this  distinction.
Firstly, it is common in contemporary society to uncritically ignore the
distinction and simply equate personal autonomy with ‘doing what
you want’.6 Against the view that autonomy is unlimited freedom of
action, we must clarify philosophically the meaning of autonomy and
show that and why it is a distinct ideal from ‘doing what you want’.
Secondly, apart from the ideas around in contemporary society, there
is a philosophical strand and tradition of thinking about freedom and
about autonomy in terms of ‘doing what you want’ (Hobbes, Hume,
Mill, etc.7). In opposition to these views I will afﬁrm the modern ideal
of autonomy as an ideal distinct from ‘doing what you want’, for it is
as such that the modern ideal of autonomy is a signiﬁcant modern
ideal. It is a signiﬁcant modern ideal in the sense that it is (1) a well-
deﬁned ideal, (2) a dominant ideal today, and (3) an ideal that can be
defended adequately as a cogent philosophical notion. This focus on
the most signiﬁcant ideal of autonomy does not mean that from now

12 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

on the issue of ‘doing what you want’ is excluded from the discussion
altogether. It will remain ‘in play’, since often it helps to say what the
ideal of autonomy is not, and it is therefore of assistance in the process
of clariﬁcation by contrast. So although the ideal of ‘doing what you
want’ has not been clearly deﬁned yet, I will do this in further discus-
sion,8 which will bear out the precise philosophical issues at stake here,
the precise points where the difference(s) between the two ideals lie(s). 
It could be argued that it is not necessary to speak of two different
ideals here, borrowing Feinberg’s distinction between concepts and con-
ceptions9 (Feinberg 1986: 27–8). Feinberg distinguishes between different
conceptions of the concept of autonomy, by which he means different
(inter-related) meanings of this concept. The ideal of autonomy is one
such conception – a conception of the concept of autonomy. In turn,
this conception can be regarded as a concept, having itself different pos-
sible conceptions (meanings, interpretations) of it. Thus, if the concept I
am dealing with is the ideal of autonomy, then ‘doing what you want’ is
a conception of this ideal. However, calling it a conception may suggest
that it is a possible, viable, and valid interpretation of autonomy, a legit-
imate child of the mother concept. Therefore, if we do not want to speak
of distinct ideals, it would be better to apply to ‘doing what you want’
either a neutral term (interpretation) or a term relatively biased in favour
of the ideal of autonomy as against ‘doing what you want’. I afﬁrm both
the  distinction  of  autonomy  from  ‘doing  what  you  want’,  and  the
primacy of the former as an ideal over the latter. Since I argue for these
positions  throughout  this  and  the  following  chapters,  I  will  use  the
seemingly  ‘biased’  way  of  characterising  their  relationship.  In  what
follows, the starting point is the argument that there is a distinction,
which will then initiate a discussion of how both distinctive elements
are precisely related. 

The  distinction  between  the  modern  ideal  of  the  person  as  an
autonomous individual and what I will now call the ‘poor’ variant or
wrong  interpretation  of  this  ideal,  i.e.  the  ideal  of  doing  what  you
want,  can  be  clariﬁed  by  looking  at  contemporary  discussions  of
freedom. I think Frankfurt’s distinction between freedom of action and
freedom of will is particularly helpful here:

A person who is free to do what he wants to do may yet not be in a
position  to  have  the  will  he  wants.  Suppose,  however,  that  he
enjoys both freedom of action and freedom of the will. Then he is
not only free to do what he wants to do; he is also free to want
what he wants to want. It seems to me that he has, in that case, all

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 13

the freedom it is possible to desire or to conceive. There are other
good  things  in  life,  and  he  may  not  possess  some  of  them.  But
there is nothing in the way of freedom that he lacks. (Frankfurt
1982 (1971): 93)

So  Frankfurt  makes  a  distinction  between  freedom  of  action  and
freedom of will. Freedom of action means being able to do what you
want. But the quotation above suggests that this is not ‘all the freedom
it is possible to desire or to conceive’ and so it cannot be an absolute or
unqualiﬁed ideal. For, Frankfurt’s second kind of freedom, the freedom
of the will, allows for a kind of ‘overriding’ mode of freedom, of being
able to regulate ‘doing what you want’, by not wanting a particular
ﬁrst-order  desire:  I  may  desire  to  not  want  something  I  want.  For
example, the drug addict may want to take his drug, but at the same
time may not want to want the drug, may not want to have this desire.
He  has  the  second-order  desire  to  not  have  the  ﬁrst-order  desire.
Although  Frankfurt  (at  least  in  his  earlier  work)  does  not  explicitly
mention any ideal (his discussion is a discussion of freedom), he argues
that I am only fully a person if I am able to develop and exercise this
second-order desire to want or not want a certain desire to be my will
(see earlier distinction from animals and wantons (Section 1.3.). It is
this  freedom,  the  ‘freedom  of  will’,  and  not  (only)  the  ‘freedom  of
action’ which is held to be an ideal, and which is arguably (part of) the
ideal of the autonomous person. 

This is the distinction explained by using Frankfurt’s conceptual appa-
ratus; there are other ways to explain the ideal of autonomy in contrast
with the ‘ideal’ of ‘doing what you want’, and I will refer to other writers
and currents of thought later in this book. As I have suggested already,
although it is not my main purpose to defend the ideal of autonomy
against the ‘ideal’ of ‘doing what you want’, it is necessarily part of this
book. As will be shown, the view that ‘doing what you want’ is an ideal 
of the person suffers from the following problems.

Firstly, it is internally inconsistent, so not an ideal. The pursuit of
‘doing what you want’ as an ideal inevitably undermines itself, since
empirically any effort to devote yourself exclusively to ‘doing what you
want’ puts you in a position in which you cannot do what you want.
To use a metaphor: you become the slave of your desires. The pursuit
of the ideal of ‘doing what you want’ is ultimately self-defeating. Apart
from the empirical argument, we can also argue for this point by using
our understanding of Frankfurt’s ideal of a person (and, as we will see,
the extended version of this ideal that will be developed in this book).

14 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

The  gist  of  it  is  the  idea  that  to  really  be  autonomous  you  need  to
direct yourself to something which is not simply the objective of your
own ﬁrst-order desires. Only then it is possible to ‘identify decisively’
with a certain desire, to make it ‘your own’. Otherwise there is loss of
control  and  a  certain  desire  will  ‘enslave’  you.  (I  will  present  this
argument in due course (Chapters 3 and 4)).

Secondly, ‘doing what you want’ is arguably not a dominant ideal.
Who  seriously  holds  and  practises  this  ideal  –  with  its  full  conse-
quences?  To  practice  ‘doing  what  you  want’  would  imply  that  we
always follow our desires, which is inconsistent with what we actu-
ally do. We know that we are not everywhere and always able to do
what  we  want.  For  example,  the  mere  fact  that  we  live  in  society
restricts our freedom to do what we want. It could be objected that
although we are not able to realise the ideal, we could still wish to do
what we want, it could be still our ideal. However, this is inconsistent
with our beliefs: most of us believe that we also ought not always to
follow our desires. 

Thirdly, ‘doing what you want’ is a misinterpretation of, and so is
distinct from, the ideal of autonomy (I began this argument earlier in
this chapter). The grounds for the validity of this claim will be demon-
strated parallel with the work done on the reﬁnement of the ideal of
autonomy; the clearer this ideal becomes, the more obvious its differ-
ence from ‘doing what you want’ will be. As noted above (see note 8 to
this section), I will also explicitly point out and discuss this difference
when appropriate.

Inner and outer autonomy

1.5.5.
Feinberg seems to agree with the point that ‘doing what you want’ does
not deserve the name ‘autonomy’. In his essay ‘The Idea of a Free Man’
(1973) we ﬁnd autonomy deﬁned as ‘I am autonomous if I rule me, and
no one else rules I’. Although I have quoted this deﬁnition before, closer
inspection reveals two distinctive aspects of autonomy, which I shall call
an ‘outer’ aspect and an ‘inner’ aspect. This distinction is very important
and will be a signiﬁcant feature of the forthcoming discussion. 

What I mean by the inner aspect of autonomy is captured in the
phrase ‘I rule me’. The ideal of autonomy here is that we are able, in
Feinberg’s words, to ‘identify with the desire that is higher in our per-
sonal hierarchy, and consider ourselves to be the subject rather than
the object of constraint’ (Feinberg 1973: 148). This ideal can be reﬁned
by looking at what it would be for a person not to be autonomous.
According to Feinberg, the non-autonomous person is a person who

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 15

has ‘no hierarchical structure of wants, and aims, and ideals, and no
clear conception of where it is within him, that he really resides’. Such
a  person  would  be  ‘a  battleﬁeld  for  all  of  his  constituent  elements,
tugged this way and that, and fragmented hopelessly’ (Feinberg 1973:
149). Although such a person may have authentic desires and aims,
desires and aims that can be called his own, he fails to possess and exer-
cise  autonomy  because  the  internal  order  and  structure  is  lacking.
Feinberg argues that even though such a person may ‘do anything he
wants’,  he  is  unable  to  order  the  options  available  in  a  hierarchy.
Feinberg concludes that ‘surely it is more plausible to construe such a
state as unfreedom than as an illustration of the dreadfulness of too
much freedom’ (Feinberg 1973: 149). This shows how ambiguous the
notion of freedom is. Autonomy, by contrast, lends itself to a more
precise deﬁnition, and is therefore a better candidate to use as the key
concept of the modern ideal of a person. It is clear that this person – as
characterised by Feinberg – is not autonomous, whatever his status in
terms of freedom. ‘When the I is incapable of governing its Me, the
result is anomie, a condition which is not control from without, but
rather being virtually “out of control” altogether’ (Feinberg 1973: 163). 
Whereas the inner aspect of autonomy refers to the relations and
state of affairs within the person, I shall say that outer autonomy con-
cerns the relationship between the person and the rest of the world, in
particular  other  people.  Indeed,  I  hold  that  since  the  laws  of  the
natural world are beyond our control (we can only try to discover them
and use that knowledge), the issue of autonomy in its external aspect
arises  only  in  relation  to  other  people,  and  the  social  and  cultural
world in general. Again it is useful here to deﬁne autonomy by looking
at one of its contrasts: ‘forms of passive mindless adjustment (the pejo-
rative  term  is  “conformity”)  to  the  requirements  of  one’s  culture’
(Feinberg 1973: 163). Here the other-direction is total; there is com-
plete attunement to the wishes of others. Autonomous persons, on the
contrary,  are  ‘capable  of  conforming  if  they  choose.  […]  They  will
conform when and only when there are good reasons for doing so; and
they can attend to reason free from the interfering static of “signals”
from other voices. They can control the speed and direction of their
gyroscopes… [They are not] indifferent to the reactions of others, but
[they] can be moved by other considerations too’ (Feinberg 1973: 165). 
What  precisely  is  the  relationship  between  the  inner  and  outer
aspects of autonomy? To arrive at a complete picture containing both
aspects, we can use Feinberg’s comparison between the independence
and  self-government  of  the  individual  and  the  independence  and 

16 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

self-government of the state. He remarks that ‘self-government might
turn out to be more repressive even than foreign occupation. Yet, for
all of that, the state might still be politically independent, sovereign,
and  governed  from  within,  hence  free.  Analogously,  it  is  often  said
that the individual person is “free” when his or her ruling part or “real
self” governs, and is subject to no foreign power, either external or
internal,  to  whose  authority  it  has  not  consented’  (Feinberg  1973:
158–9). So here we have two aspects together, the external and internal
one, the outer and inner one. Only the outer is not enough for auton-
omy to be complete; there could be some form of ‘inner’ repression
which  prevents  the  person  from  attaining  full  autonomy.  (I  shall
discuss ‘inner autonomy’ in the course of this book; I will return to the
issue of repression in particular in Part II, Section 6.4.1.)

Feinberg  reminds  us  that  ‘free’  means  also  having  a  certain  legal-
political status. Historically, to be a freeman was to be a full member of
the  political  community.  One  contemporary  meaning  of  political
freedom as being entitled to certain rights on the basis of membership
of  the  state  as  a  political  community  still  relates  to  that  historical
meaning.  However,  we  may  say  that  the  ideal  of  the  autonomous
person as outlined before does not depend on this political freedom. It
could be imagined that somebody is literally a slave but is still able to
order his desires and aims in a hierarchy. Although he is not able to do
or get what he wants, he may be an ideal person in the sense that he
has the balanced order of autonomy, residing completely in himself.
However, it may be objected that the modern ideal of the autonomous
person does include ‘not being a slave’, since this would mean that he
lacks ‘outer autonomy’. Therefore, I conclude that autonomy is not a
necessary condition for political freedom, but political freedom is a
necessary condition for autonomy. However, I argue that although full
autonomy is not possible in the condition of slavery, a slave might still
possess inner autonomy. If I can choose whether to do what I have to
do willingly or not, making the command my own wish or desire or
not, I am still autonomous in the ‘inner’ sense. So although I’m not
free  and  not  autonomous  in  the  ‘outer’  sense  I  do  not  lack  ‘inner’
autonomy. To that extent, it may be still possible for me to realise part
of the ideal of a person, whatever my legal or political status is. 

This  discussion  shows  that  the  distinction  between  ‘inner’  and
‘outer’ autonomy allows us to further analyse the meaning of auton-
omy  and  to  make  other  distinctions  which  remain  concealed  if  we
applied the term ‘autonomy’ on its own. Equally, the term ‘freedom’
on its own appears to be too vague to allow for such distinctions. We

The Modern Ideal of Autonomy 17

have now a clear criterion to decide whether a person is autonomous
in the fullest sense of the word, namely two necessary conditions. The
ﬁrst condition is that I am not restrained by, and not dependent on,
something inside me. The second condition is that I am not restrained
by, and not dependent on, something outside me. Whether a certain
condition or state of the person satisﬁes these criteria depends on (a)
whether or not something can be identiﬁed as putting a constraint on
me (‘Is it really a constraint?’ and ‘Am I really dependent on it?’ are the
questions to be asked); and on (b) whether or not this constraint or
source of dependence – if there is one at all (question a) – is something
inside or outside me (‘Is it really an ‘inner’ constraint?’ and ‘Is it really
an ‘outer’ constraint?’ are the key questions).

This criterion, based on the distinction between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’
autonomy, will be used throughout this book as an analytical tool. As
an  aspect  of  the  argument  about  autonomy,  it  will  be  consolidated
through this use, and its explanatory power will be shown more fully
as the general argument of my book develops.

1.5.6. Autonomy and morality
Does autonomy include the freedom to choose evil? Considering the
dominant ideal of autonomy as articulated so far, it is evident that the
authors discussed share the view that autonomy and morality are to be
considered as fundamentally distinct issues. Whether or not I choose
evil, if it is my choice, a choice I take in the capacity of being my own
master, a subject, a doer, a willing being (Berlin), if I am self-governing
(Christman) and self-ruling (Feinberg), if I succeed in having the will I
want (Frankfurt), if I engage in strong evaluation (Taylor), then, on this
view, there is nothing in the way of autonomy that I lack. Feinberg
explicitly  draws  a  distinction  between  the  ideal  of  autonomy  and
moral excellence, arguing that since autonomy is consistent with ruth-
lessness, cruelty, and other ‘failings’, it is at best only a partial ideal
‘insufﬁcient for full moral excellence’(Feinberg 1986: 45).

It remains to be seen whether this view can be defended as coherent.
I will return to this issue in Chapter 4, where it will receive further dis-
cussion in the light of my attempt to reconcile ‘modern’ and ‘ancient’,
and in Part II (for example, in my discussion there of Frankfurt). But it
seems to me that there is no doubt that the view that autonomy, by
itself, is morally ‘neutral’, and that an autonomous person can choose
evil, is a key part of the dominant modern ideal of autonomy. There
may be other views, but this is the dominant one and the one I choose
to engage with in this book. 

18 The Metaphysics of Autonomy

1.6. Conclusion: A sketch of the modern ideal of the
autonomous person

My discussion of autonomy so far yields a reasonably clear picture of
what it means to say ‘I wish to be an autonomous person’. It means that
I wish to rule, govern, and determine myself. This ideal has an ‘inner’
aspect (I wish to rule my desires) and an ‘outer’ aspect (I wish not to be
ruled by something outside me). If I want the latter, I also want political
liberty. Furthermore, the ideal includes the wish to exercise my capacity
to  rule  myself  or  the  wish  to  be  in  the  condition of  self-rule.  It  can
concern my present (inner or outer) situation or extend to the future
and my life as a whole. It can include the wish to (be able to and be in a
condition to) use my governance and rulership to evaluate and question
my  desires  or  perhaps  even  myself  as  a  person.  In  Frankfurt’s  and
Taylor’s words, I wish to form higher-order desires (volitions) or engage
in strong evaluation. Related to this wish is the ideal of being a person,
in the sense of wishing to be different from animals or wantons, who
lack this capacity of self-evaluation (inner aspect), and in the sense of
wishing to have and to use the capacity of free will, to be a space of
freedom in a deterministic universe (outer aspect). This ideal is different
from  the  ideal  of  doing  what  you  want;  if  I  rule  myself  I  constrain
myself in some way. But this constraint is not necessarily moral. The
dominant modern ideal of autonomy is construed as a morally neutral
ideal, that is, the wish to be autonomous does not necessarily include
the wish to be morally good or excellent; the wish to be autonomous
and the wish to do evil are seen as consistent.

Although not all of us share this ideal of the autonomous person, there
is no doubt that it occupies an inﬂuential place in our contemporary
culture  and  society.  This  was  not  always  the  case.  In  the  following
chapter I will consider ‘ancient’ (as opposed to ‘modern’) ideals of the
person that appear to be very different from, if not entirely opposed to,
the modern ideal of autonomy.
