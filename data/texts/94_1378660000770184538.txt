The lats gene encodes a family of proteins conserved from insects to humans. Drosophila carrying lats mutant cells or mice de®cient for Lats1 develop tumors in various tissues. The mammalian LATS1 protein was previously shown to bind to CDC2, suggesting that LATS1 may modulate G2/M cell cycle progression by aecting CDC2 activity. In this study, we introduced human LATS1 into LATS7/7 MEF cells by adenovirusmediated gene transfer. Overexpression of LATS1 causes G2/M arrest through inhibition of CDC2 kinase activity. Furthermore, overexpression of LATS1 signi®cantly suppressed the human tumor cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo by inducing either cell cycle arrest in G2/M or apoptosis. These observations suggest that LATS1 is a potent growth suppressor and, like other tumor suppressors, it suppresses growth by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

Introduction
lats is a novel tumor suppressor gene originally isolated from Drosophila by the mosaic screening approach (Xu et al., 1995). Somatic cells mutant for Drosophila lats undergo extensive proliferation and form large tumors with morphological characteristics similar to those of human tumors. The mammalian homologues of lats were recently isolated (Tao et al., 1999; Yabuta et al., 2000). Introducing the human lats (LATS1) gene into Drosophila lats mutants can prevent tumor formation and support normal development in ¯ies, demonstrating that the function of these genes are conserved from ¯ies to humans (Tao et al., 1999). Moreover, mice de®cient for mouse lats (Lats1) developed soft tissue sarcomas and ovarian stromal cell tumor and exhibited high sensitivity to carcinogen (St John et al., 1999). Most

interestingly, LATS1 was also shown to be phosphorylated and bind CDC2 at early mitosis. The LATS1/CDC2 complex lacks Cyclin A or B and is inactive for histone H1 kinase activity (Tao et al., 1999).
To examine the role of LATS1 in cell cycle progression, we generated LATS7/7 MEF cells. By utilizing adenovirus-mediated LATS1 gene transfer, we show that overexpression of LATS1 in LATS17/7 MEF cells inhibits CDC2 activity and causes G2/M arrest. Furthermore, overexpression of LATS1 in multiple human tumor cell lines causes either G2/M arrest or apoptosis. In vivo tumorigenecity experiments further support the in vitro results, demonstrating the growth suppression ability of the LATS1 molecule.
Results
Overexpression of LATS1 in homozygous LATS1-deficient (LATS7/7) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells causes G2/M arrest by inhibiting CDC2/Cyclin B kinase activity
To investigate if LATS1 aect cell cycle progression, we ®rst generated LATS7/7 MEF cells by subculturing the mouse ®broblast cells from 13.5-days-old LATS7/7 embryo. We overexpressed LATS1 in LATS7/7 MEF cells by virus gene transfer. Compared with overexpression of adenovirus (Ad) control, overexpression of recombinant LATS1 adenovirus (LATS1-Ad) in LATS17/7 MEF cells markedly increased cell population in G2/M phase (Figure 1a). This cell cycle arrest induced by LATS1-Ad is speci®c because no increase in G2/M cell population was found in LATS7/7 MEF cells infected with recombinant b-galactosidase adenovirus (b-gal-Ad). Since CDC2 kinase is the major regulator responsible for the progression of G2/M transition and LATS1 was shown to bind CDC2 (Tao et al., 1999), we subsequently tested whether the G2/M arrest caused by LATS1 is due to its inhibition of CDC2 kinase activity. Consistent with our previous ®nding (Tao et al., 1999), CDC2 precipitated with LATS1 does not contain kinase activity (Figure 1b). Importantly, CDC2/Cyclin B kinase activity signi®cantly decreased

About 16106 cells/100-mm plate were infected with Ad, b-gal-Ad or LATS-Ad at 200 MOI for 2 h. After 48 h, infected cells were harvested, treated with RNase A (200 mg/ml), stained with propidium iodide (50 mg/ml) and analysed with FAScan ¯ow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson). The percentage of each cell cycle phase (G1, S, G2/M) was calculated using the CELLQUEST program. This result is the representative of three independent experiments. (b) Histone H1 kinase assay. LATS7/7 MEF cells infected with Ad, b-gal-Ad or LATS1-Ad at 200 MOI were lysated 48 h after the infection. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by using 200 mg protein lysate and 2 mg anti-LATS1 (Yu03) or anti-cyclin B1 antibodies. Precipitated proteins were either subject to Western blot or subsequently incubated in kinase buer with 5 mg histone H1 and 10 mCi [g-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min. (c) Western blot analysis of LATS1, CDC2 and Cyclin B protein levels. Cells were infected with Ad, b-gal-Ad or LATS1-Ad at 200 MOI for 2 h. About 10 mg cell extracts obtained 48 h after the infection were analysed by Western blot. b-actin was used as an internal control

after LATS1-Ad infection, as detected in H1 kinase assay with proteins immunoprecipitated with antiCyclin B antibody (Figure 1b). Downregulation of CDC2 kinase activity is not due to reduced level of CDC2 or Cyclin B, because no dierences were found in CDC2 and Cyclin B levels irrespective of whether or not LATS1 was overexpressed (Figure 1c).

LATS1 overexpression causes G2/M arrest or apoptosis in human cancer cells
Since most of tumor suppressors inhibit tumor growth by inducing either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, we tested this possibility by comparing the cell cycle pro®le in six human tumor cell lines derived from various human cancer tissues after infection of these cells with Ad or LATS-Ad at 200 multiplicity of

infection (MOI). Western blot analysis indicated that the level of LATS1 dramatically increased 48 h after the infection of tumor cells with LATS1-Ad (Figure 2a). Overexpression of LATS1 caused an increase in

cells at the G2/M phase and a corresponding decrease in the G1 phase for HeLa, C33A and U87MG cells. However, a signi®cant increase in sub-G1 phase, an indication of DNA fragmentation caused by apoptosis,
was observed in A549, HCT116, and MCF7 cells
(Figure 2b). To con®rm that the induction of G2/M arrest in some tumor cells was due to LATS1
overexpression, we infected HeLa cells with LATS1-
Ad virus at increasing MOI. Western blot analysis
shows that the level of LATS1 expression progressively
enhanced with increasing virus infection concentration
(Figure 3a). This increase of LATS1 expression is
correlated well with a progressive increase of G2/M phase cells and decrease of G1 phase cells (Figure 3b).

FACS analysis. The procedure was as described in Figure 1a

Morphologically, the cells infected with LATS1-Ad are large and mostly round, similar to that of mitotic cells (data not shown).
While LATS1 overexpression aects G2/M transition in HeLa, C33A, and U87MG cells, it results in an increase of cell death in the rest of the tumor cells (Figure 2b). To further con®rm that LATS1 indeed induces apoptosis in human cancer cells, we infected HCT116 cells with increasing MOI of LATS1-Ad. As shown in Figure 4a, with the increase of virus infected, the percentage of sub-G1 cells gradually increased. This increase is well correlated with an enhancement of LATS1 level in the cells (Figure 4a,d). The DNA fragmentation induced by LATS1 was further con®rmed in situ by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. As shown in Figure 4b, only the cells infected with LATS1-Ad rather than Ad have fragmented nuclei incorporated with ¯uorescein-labeled dUTP, indicating apoptosis-induced DNA strand breaks. Since activation of caspase-3 is one of the major steps for apoptosis induction, we also examined the caspase-3 activity after LATS1 infection. Consistent with the induction of apoptosis, caspase-3 activity was signi®cantly higher at higher MOI of LATS1-Ad. To characterize further on the molecular mechanism of LATS1-induced apoptosis, we examined the level of apoptosis-associated proteins, p53, Bcl-2 and Bax, after infection of HCT116 cells with LATS1-Ad. With the increase of LATS1 level in the cells, p53 was progressively induced (Figure 4d). However, no signi®cant changes were found in the levels of the other two apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bax.
Overexpression of LATS1 suppresses human tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo
To examine whether LATS1 can suppress human tumor cell growth in vitro, we examined the proliferation of these six human tumor cell lines derived from various human cancer tissues after overexpression of LATS1 in these cells. Infection of LATS1-Ad at 100 MOI into these human tumor cells dramatically inhibits their cell proliferation independent of endogenous LATS1 level (Figure 5a). As a control, no growth inhibition was found when the tumor cells were infected with the viral vector control Ad at the same MOI (Figure 5a). Consistently, anchorage-independent growth of tumor cells on soft agar was also signi®cantly suppressed by LATS1-Ad (Figure 5b). To examine whether LATS1 can suppress tumor formation in vivo, we injected tumor cells infected by either Ad or LATS1-Ad into nude mice and monitored tumor progression every week for 6 weeks. As expected, all the mice injected with human tumor cells infected with the control Ad virus developed tumors 4 weeks after the injection. However, mice injected with all six lines of human tumor cells that are overexpressed with LATS1 (LATS1-Ad) developed no tumors 6 weeks after the injection, except for one small tumors in mouse injected with A549 (Table 1).

Among the tumor suppressor genes identi®ed so far, most suppress cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest. For example, the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer, such as Rb, p53, PTEN and p16INK4A, are all involved in the G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint (Agarwal et al., 1995; Di Cristofano and Pandol®, 2000; Harbour and Dean, 2000). In contrast, few tumor suppressors have been identi®ed to be involved in G2/M regulation. The G2/M transition is mostly controlled by a protein kinase CDC2. Activation of CDC2 kinase activity through depohosphorylation at Thr-14/Thr-15 by CDC25C has been considered to be the critical step for M phase progression (Elledge, 1996). Recently, the p53 tumor suppressor protein was found to be implicated in the control of the G2/M transition. Overexpression of p53 in p53-de®cient human ®broblasts resulted in both G1 and G2/M arrest (Agarwal et al., 1995). Further studies demonstrated that p53 induced G2/M arrest by inhibiting the CDC2/cyclin B1 kinase activity through upregulation of 14-3-3, an inhibitor of CDC25C, or downregulation of cyclin B1 (Hermeking et al., 1997; Innocente et al., 1999). Other tumor suppressors, such as BRCA1, RIZ1 and MXI1, have also been found to induce G2/M arrest in human cancer cells (Wechsler et al., 1997; He et al., 1998; MacLachlan et al., 2000). However, the mechanisms for their growth arrest are still unclear.
In this study, we provided evidence that the human homologue of Drosophila tumor suppressor, LATS1, can negatively regulate cell growth in vitro and in vivo by causing G2/M arrest through inhibition of CDC2 kinase activity. Moreover, growth suppression activity of LATS1 seems independent of its endogenous level in the cells. Thus, LATS1, like p21 or p16 (El-Deiry et al., 1993; Quelle et al., 1995), may be a general negative regulator of cell cycle progression. Similar to LATS1, GADD45, a protein whose gene is p53 downstream gene and DNA damage induced, was also found to be associated with CDC2 and inhibit the CDC2/cyclin B1 kinase activity (Zhan et al., 1999). Overexpression of GADD45 causes G2/M arrest in human normal ®broblasts and colorectal carcinoma cells (Wang et al., 1999). Recently, 14-3-3s was also shown to cause G2/M arrest by inhibiting CDC2 function through binding and sequestering CDC2 in the cytoplasm (Chan et al., 1999). Therefore, LATS1, GADD45, and 14-3-3 represent a new group of proteins that can negatively regulate cell proliferation by binding and inactivating CDC2. In addition to the function of cell cycle arrest, tumor suppressors can also suppress tumors by inducing apoptosis. Overexpression of tumor suppressors p53, PTEN, p16INK4A and BRCA1 can cause apoptosis in human cancer cell lines derived from various cancers (Levine, 1997; Di Cristofano and Pandol®, 2000; Kataoka et al., 2000). However, the mechanisms by which each tumor suppressor gene induces apoptosis are diverse. For example, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing proapoptotic genes such as bax and p53AIP1 (Oda et al., 2000).

About 56103 HeLa cells or 16104 other tumor cells infected with Ad or LATS-Ad were resuspended in 0.35% agarose and seeded in triplicate onto 0.7% agarose in 35-mm plates. Approximately 14 days later, the colonies were counted and the mean values+standard deviations were calculated from three individual plates

On the other hand, p16INK4A causes apoptosis through down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (Kataoka et al., 2000). In this study, we found that the

level of p53 and the caspase-3 activity is signi®cantly induced under enforced expression of LATS1, indicating that LATS1 may induce apoptosis through p53 and

caspase-3 pathways. On the other hand, the levels of Bax and Bcl-2 were unchanged after induction of apoptosis by LATS1, suggesting that apoptosis induced by LATS1 may not be mediated through upregulation of bax or downregulation of bcl-2. Since LATS1induced apoptosis was observed only in cancer cell lines containing wild-type p53 (A549, HCT116 and MCF7), but not in those containing HPV E6-mediated degraded or mutated p53 (HeLa and C33A), p53 may be involved in LATS1-induced apoptosis. In addition, p53 mRNA was also induced after overexpression of LATS1 (unpublished data). Therefore, LATS1 may upregulate p53 by directly or indirectly inducing p53 transcription. Since p53 induces apoptosis by upregulating various proapoptotic genes (Levine, 1997; Oda et al., 2000), it is still unclear which gene is directly responsible for LATS1-mediated apoptosis. Further studies will be helpful to under the signal transduction pathway of LATS1-induced apoptosis.
The lats gene was ®rst identi®ed in Drosophila as a tumor suppressor. Mice de®cient for Lats1 also develops tumors. In this study, we demonstrate that LATS1 is a potent growth suppressor in all the human tumor cell lines examined. Furthermore, like many other known human tumor suppressors, it also suppresses growth by aecting both cell cycle progression and apoptosis. These observations strongly argue that LATS1 may play a role in tumorigenesis in humans and screening potential LATS1 mutations in human cancer cells will be a warranted endeavor.

The transfected cells were then covered by 0.5% agarose and incubated at 378C for 10 ± 14 days. Potential plaques were subsequently isolated, eluted, ampli®ed and examined for the presence of Ad DNA or the expression of LATS1 by DNA extraction and restriction enzyme digestion or Western blot. The positive Ad or LATS1-Ad viruses were ampli®ed in 293 cells and tittered.
Cell proliferation, soft agar and tumorigenicity assays
Cells were infected with Ad or LATS1-Ad at MOI of 100 for 2 h. The procedures for cell proliferation, soft agar and tumorigenicity assays were as described (Yang et al., 1996).
Western blot
Western blot analysis was as described (Yang et al., 1998). Anti-LATS1 polyclonal antibody (pAb, Yu03) was produced previously in our laboratory (St John et al., 1999). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for p53, CDC2, Bcl-2, and Bax were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Anti-b-actin mAb was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Kinase assay
A total of 200 mg protein lysate was precleared with either protein A-agarose or protein G-agarose beads (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and subsequently incubated with 2 mg of Y03 anti-LATS1 pAb and anti-cyclin B1 mAb at 48C for 2 h. The antibodies were then precipitated with beads. The precipitated beads were washed three times with lysis buer (50 mM Tis-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.3 mg/ml antipain-HCl, 50 mg/ml Bestatin, 0.1 mg/ml Chymostatin, 0.3 mg/ml E-64, 50 mg/ml leupeptin, 50 mg/ml papstatin, 0.3 mg/ml phosphoramidon, 2 mg/ml pefabloc, 50 mg/ml aprotinin) and once with kinase buer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA), and incubated in 20 ml of reaction buer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM NaVO4, 0.1 mM ATP, 10 mCi [a-32P]ATP, 5 mg histone H1) at room temperature for 20 min. Five ml of 56Laemmli sample buer was added to stop the reaction. The phosphorylation of histone H1 was examined by separating the samples on a 15% SDS ± PAGE gel and autoradiography.

TUNEL assay
In situ detection of apoptotic cells was performed using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) following the manufacturer's instruction. In brief, about 16105 HCT116 cells were seeded in each well of 6-well plate containing cover slip 24 h prior to infection. The cells were then infected with either Ad or LATS1-Ad for 2 h at 200 MOI. Under this condition, 100% of the cells were infected by virus. After incubation at 378C for 72 h, the cells were ®xed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at RT, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice, and incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture (in a humidi®ed chamber for 60 min at 378C in the dark. After counterstained with propodium iodide (PI), image acquisition was performed using MRC1024 Laser Scanning Confocal Imaging System (Becton Dickinson).

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and caspase-3 activity analysis
For FACS and caspase-3 activity analysis, cells were infected with adenoviruses at various MOI for 2 h. After 48 h, both the adherent and ¯oating cells are collected and processed. The procedures for FACS and caspase-3 activity assay were as described (Yang et al., 2000).
