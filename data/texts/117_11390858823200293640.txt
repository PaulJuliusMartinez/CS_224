Preface
This solutions manual contains answers to all the questions not already answered in Business Accounting 1 and Business Accounting 2. It can be seen that there are a considerable number of questions in both textbooks. About one-half of these have the answers at the back of the relevant textbook, while the remainder of the answers are contained in this manual.
The result of this is to give a high degree of flexibility in the use of the textbooks. To illustrate the contents of each chapter, the questions can be used which have answers in the textbook. Any students who are absent can be told what they have missed and can look up the answers themselves. Students who arrive late on the course can also be told what work to do and they can check their own progress against the answers as given. However, quite obviously work must be set, either in class or for homework, for which answers are not available to students. This manual can therefore be used to check such work.
Whilst every endeavour has been made to show workings quite fully, it must be appreciated that there are often different ways of getting to the same answer. This manual would be unduly lengthy and complicated if every version of arriving at the answer were to be shown. The methods chosen are therefore those judged to be the best from a teaching point of view.
Frank Wood and Alan Sangster
By writing on letterheaded paper of the institution where you teach, giving details of the course for which you use Business Accounting 1 or Business Accounting 2 with your classes, you can obtain complimentary copies of this manual. This manual is not available for students, nor is it in any way available for sale to the general public. It is also available on the lecturer's password-protected section of the Frank Wood website at www.pearsoned.co.uk/wood

PART 1 BUSINESS ACCOUNTING 1

Students and examination success

Experienced teachers and lecturers know just as much as we do about this topic. There will, however, be quite a lot of people reading this who are new to teaching, and who have little experience in understanding how the examiner views things. If we have anything to offer, it is simply that we have, between us, been concerned with accounting education for many years and have been examiners for several external examining bodies.
The Notes for Students at the start of both Business Accounting 1 and Business Accounting 2 deal with examination techniques. Make certain the students read these. Go through these with them. If we all tell students that what these say is true, then they are more likely to believe us.

How students lose marks
1 Lack of knowledge (obviously) but they throw away marks unnecessarily for all of the following reasons:
(a) Untidy work, including columns of figures not lined up. (b) Bad handwriting. Do not make it difficult for the examiner to read and mark. (c) Lack of headings, dates, sub-totals, etc. in accounting statements. (d) Not submitting proper workings.
You can only get them to rectify everything under this heading by insisting on them correcting (a), (b), (c) and (d) from early on in the course. Do not wait until a few weeks before the examination to insist upon properly laid out and neatly constructed work.
2 Students very often do not follow the rubric on the examination paper. If it asks for two questions only from Section A, then it means just that. A remarkably high percentage do not follow the instructions per the rubric.
3 Students fail to answer the questions as set. If, for example, an examiner wants a list, students will lose marks by giving explanations instead. Students must tackle the question in the prescribed way and not do it differently. The percentage of students passing examinations would rise dramatically if only we could correct this failing. A good plan is to get them to highlight the instruction that shows how the examiner wants the question to be answered, e.g. List the ways by which . . . Describe the ways by which . . . Write a report to the managing director about the ways by which . . . Discuss how the ways by which . . . Explain how the ways by which . . . Then, get them to underline the key words in the rest of the question.
They need as much practice as possible in doing this, especially for essay-type questions. Practice is even more essential for students for whom English is not their first language. At the end of this section are 20 essay questions in which we have already highlighted the instruction and underlined the key words. See if your students can do the same.
4 Poor technique with essay questions. Business Accounting 2, Notes for students, the section headed `Answering essay questions' covers this point. Discuss this with your students who have to tackle essay questions.
5 Not tackling the required number of questions. I have always found it very difficult to convince students to get hold of the idea that they will get more marks for five uncompleted questions than they will for four completed questions, when the examiner has asked for five to be attempted. Time planning is essential.
6 By not tackling the easiest questions first. Years ago, we did quite a lot of research into the results of students who had followed this advice, compared with those who ignored it. Following the advice produced better results.
7 By simply regurgitating the contents of a textbook in essay answers. For instance, when an examiner set a question on, say, materiality. Most of the answers simply gave exactly the same examples, word for word sometimes, that we have given in Business Accounting 1. Examiners are looking for originality and imagination. Students will get excellent marks if they give their own examples. A good idea is that, for each of the concepts and conventions, they think up their own examples before the examination. There are going to be more and more questions on these things in the years ahead.

8 Examiners like to see answers where students realise that all accounting is not found in textbooks, but exists for the use of businesses. Get them to use examples in essay questions based on what they have observed in the businesses around them. For example, a question on ratios and interpretation will often be answered by students just using figures. They should also say why the figures have changed; what possible causes there might have been. In their life outside their studies, they should observe how accounting is carried out. They all go at one time or another to refectories, restaurants, shops, department stores, clothes shops, travel on buses and trains, etc. They should observe how the money is calculated and collected, what sort of bills or tickets are given out, how fraud or errors could occur, and so on. They can give this flavour of the real world in their answers. Believe us, they will get better marks.
Essay questions ­ how not to misunderstand them
1 List the various pieces of information which should be shown on a sales invoice. 2 Describe what is meant by an imprest system. 3 Accounting based on historical costs can be misleading. Discuss. 4 The bookkeeper has said that if an error does not affect trial balance agreement then it cannot affect
anything else very much. You are to write a report to the managing director stating whether or not you agree with the bookkeeper. 5 Give five examples of different compensating errors and explain why they cancel each other out. 6 Explain the differences between the straight line and reducing balance methods of depreciation. 7 Briefly describe the benefits to be gained from maintaining control accounts. 8 List six instances of errors which could cause the trial balance totals to disagree. 9 Name three methods of inventory valuation, and briefly describe any one of them. 10 `Without the use of accounting ratios, much of the accounting work already performed would be wasted.' Discuss the amount of truth in this statement. 11 How can retail stores use accounting ratios to help them to plan future inventory levels? 12 Assess the benefits of double entry as compared with single entry methods of bookkeeping. 13 Define depreciation and describe how the annual charge is worked out using the straight line method. 14 For a firm buying goods on credit, how can it calculate the figure of purchases even though a Purchases Journal has not been kept? 15 List the differences between the income and expenditure account of a club and the income statement of a trading concern. 16 `It is unsatisfactory for the treasurer of a club to prepare and present to the members only the receipts and payments account as a summary of the records of the club's activities for the year.' Why is this true? What is the better thing to do? 17 You are to give your advice to the managing director of a company on the best manner of constructing departmental income statements. 18 How do the financial statements of a partnership vary from those of a sole trader, and why? 19 Consider the view that if profit was not calculated at all until the business was closed down, then such a calculation would be a simple and straightforward affair. 20 You are to write a letter to a friend explaining in simple terms why profit does not necessarily mean that you have cash in the bank.
Practice on past full examination papers
If students have not tackled past papers, under as near examination conditions as possible, they will often get quite a shock when they first sit an accounting examination.
This very often is due to two main reasons:
(a) There is such a lot to do in such a short time. (b) Even though there is so much to do, in professional examinations in particular, many of the questions
are quite difficult with some complicated calculations or adjustments.
If students can attempt, say, at least two such papers and then have their attempts marked and criticised, they will normally learn a lot from the experience.
Examination questions and marking schemes
We had originally intended to put here some typical examination questions and their marking schemes. However, after some considerable thought, we decided against doing so. There is no one precise mode of marking and any suggestions that we might make could perhaps create more arguments and consequent misunderstandings.
Frank Wood and Alan Sangster, Business Accounting 1 & 2 Solutions Manual, 11th Edition 4 © Pearson Education Limited 2008

In front of a group of people, it would be possible to do this, as we could deal with all the comments from the group and arrive at a consensus of opinion. However, the books sell world-wide and practices can vary.
It can, however, be said that:
(a) By and large, marking is `positive', i.e. marks are awarded for what a student gets right, rather than being deducted for what a student gets wrong.
(b) However, marks are deducted for untidy work, lack of headings, dates, sub-totals, etc. (c) An incorrect part of an answer, with no workings attached to it, will get nil marks. (d) Extra, unnecessary answers, resulting from students failing to follow the rubric, will not be marked. (e) Not following the examiner's instructions will lose marks. For example, marks will be lost if, when
asked for a `report', a student gives a `list'; or if asked to `discuss', a student gives only one side of the argument; or if asked to `define', a student gives an `explanation'. Some examiners will award zero marks, even though the answers given by the student show good knowledge of the topic. Others (including ourselves) would be kinder than that. (f ) An error which repeats itself through an answer should lose only one set of marks. For instance, an error in the trading account will also affect balances in the profit and loss account, appropriation account and balance sheet. In cases of this type, only one set of marks should be lost. (g) Guessing by students is not normally penalised. The one exception that may arise concerns multiple choice questions where wrong answers may be penalised as an incentive to prevent students guessing. In this case, the examining body would make this information known well in advance of the examination date. (h) The easiest marks to get, especially in an essay question, are the first few marks. (i) Good handwriting and well displayed answers will often (although theoretically they should not) get higher marks than they deserve. This is simply because examiners are human beings with human failings, and work that can be easily marked makes them feel generous.

Answer to Question 24.2A BA 1
Capital (a) (c) (f ). Revenue (b) (d) (e) (g).

Answer to Question 24.4A BA 1
See text for how to distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure.
(i) Cost of repairs is always revenue; an extension to an asset is always capital. (ii) This is capital expenditure in the same way as buying a van to replace a van is capital expenditure. (iii) This is capital expenditure because the asset was improved by the expenditure.

Answer to Question 24.6A BA 1
Capital: 2,600 of (a); 600 of (c); 150 of (d); all of (e). Revenue: 300 of (a); all of (b); 2,680 of (c); 1,110 of (d).

(b) When an amount is not considered to be material ­ i.e. it is not of interest to the users of the financial statements ­ it may be treated as a revenue expense rather than being capitalised. In this case, it might be considered that the cost of the cabling (300 ­ 21/2% = 292.50) was not material ­ the business may,
for example, use £300 as the minimum amount that should be capitalised, anything costing less than
this being treated as a revenue expense.

(c) A bad debt is a debt which has proved to be irrecoverable and so is written off. Allowance for doubtful debts: the amount of accounts receivable on a certain date which will
probably turn out to be bad debts and have to be written off eventually.

(c) See text. Straight line is more appropriate when the economic benefits of using an asset reduce evenly over its useful economic life, such as in the case of office furnishings which will deteriorate gradually through wear and tear. Reducing balance is more appropriate when the economic benefits of using an asset reduce rapidly from the start, such as in the case of a motor vehicle ­ the cost of maintaining it, for example, is very low at the start and, generally, higher the longer it is in use.
(d) Net book value represents an estimate of the remaining economic value of an asset expressed financially on a basis which is usually directly related to its original cost, original estimate of its residual value, and original estimated useful economic life.

(a) Per text.

(b) Any three from physical deterioration, economic factors, obsolescence, inadequacy, time, wasting

character (e.g. mines).

(c) Straight line and reducing balance.

(d) Keep consistently to one particular method for an asset.

(e) Briefly: otherwise would not be able to calculate figures until asset put out of use, possibly many years

hence. Need to calculate profits, allowing for depreciation, even though figures not absolutely accurate.

(f ) Profits would be overstated. Values per balance sheet also overstated.

(g) Prudence concept does not take profits into account until they have been realised. An increase in value,

without sale, does not represent realisation.

(b) Assuming that the depreciation rate was set to match the estimated useful economic life, it should not matter which depreciation method was used. The overall reported profits during the economic life of the vehicle would be identical. However, the diminishing balance method (or reducing balance method) will result in lower reported profits in the first few years, but higher reported profits in the later years.

(12) Overstated £75.
Answer to Question 28.7A BA 1
No set answer. Note: Avoid very technical language as it is for a non-accountant. Keep it fairly brief.
(a) `Assets' means the resources possessed by the business, but there is one important qualification to this statement. That is that the asset must have cost the business something that can easily be measured in monetary terms. Whilst, therefore, your skill and knowledge may be an `asset' in ordinary everyday language, it cannot be classed as an `asset' in an accounting sense as it did not cost anything to the business. (b) The house you live in, we assume, is not used at all for your business. It cannot therefore be included as a business asset. Accordingly the increase in the value is also irrelevant.
If the house is owned by the business it would be included as an asset at £30,000 until a proper revaluation takes place. (c) Assets are called non-current assets when they are of long life, are to be used in the business and were not bought with the main purpose of resale. Examples are buildings, machinery, motor vehicles, and fixtures and fittings.
Assets are called current assets when they represent cash or are primarily for conversion into cash or have a short life. An example of a short-lived asset is that of the stock of oil held to power the boilers in a factory, as this will be used up in the near future. Other examples of current assets are cash itself, stocks of goods, debtors and bank balances. (d) Some vehicles may have been bought specifically for resale, and are therefore current assets. Other vehicles, such as a breakdown truck, have been bought for use, not resale, and are consequently noncurrent assets. See definitions in (c) above.

(e) The profit in the income statement is calculated by matching up sales for the year with those costs that have been incurred in order to achieve the sales. Some of the costs were paid for in a previous year, some items are still owed for. This means that costs do not mean items paid for in the year. Similarly, a lot of
sales will still be owed for ­ see accounts receivable ­ so that this does not equal cash received in the year. As many items in the income statement do not equal cash received or paid out, then obviously there is
not necessarily any easy comparison between profit and cash and bank balances. (f ) No, that is not true. Depreciation represents the part of the cost used up in the year. As equipment may last for several years, only part will be charged against one year.
The remaining value of the equipment is shown in your balance sheet. The total cost will be charged against your profits, but spread over several years. The total costs will only be charged once against the profits.

(c) FIFO: Advantage: related to actual movements of goods therefore closing inventory nearer to actual current price levels.
Disadvantage: during inflation profits include holding gains. LIFO: Advantage: cost of sales nearer to current price levels.
Disadvantages: not related to actual movement of goods, therefore inventory valuations will not match up to current price levels.

Answer to Question 34.2A BA 1

(a) R Jack

Income Statement for the year ending 31 March 2005

Sales

(iv)

Less Cost of goods sold:

Inventory 1 April 2004

Add Purchases

Less Inventory 31 March 2005

Gross profit
Less Expenses Net profit

The closing inventory as at 31 March 2005, as shown above, is 20,000.

Order of solving problem: (i) Average inventory is 17,000.

Therefore

14,000

+

(a)

=

17,000

Therefore (a) = 20,000.

2

(ii) can now be found by deducting (a) 20,000 from 96,000 = 76,000.

(iii) is 40% of (ii), therefore (iii) is 30,400.

(iv) is therefore needed to balance the account, i.e. 106,400.

(v) if net profit was 8% of sales it would be 8,512.

(vi) therefore expenses are 30,400 - (v) 8,512 = 21,888.

(i) (ii) (iii) (vi) (v)

14,000 82,000 96,000 20,000

106,400
76,000 30,400 21,888
8,512

(b) The total amount of profit and loss expenditure Jack must not exceed if he is to maintain a net profit on sales of 8% is, as shown in step (vi): 21,888.

Frank Wood and Alan Sangster, Business Accounting 1 & 2 Solutions Manual, 11th Edition 54 © Pearson Education Limited 2008

Answer to Question 34.4A BA 1
(a) Cost of goods sold = Sales less trade discount
(b) Sales ­ Cost of goods sold = Gross profit
(c) Total expenses = 14% of sales
(d) Gross profit - Expenses = Net profit
(e) Cost of goods sold = Inventory turnover Average inventory So, by arithmetical deduction

Category X 9,000 - 15%
= 7,650
9,000 - 7,650 = 1,350
1,260
1,350 - 1,260 = 90
7,650 = 10 ? = 765

Category Y 24,000 - 18%
= 19,680
24,000 - 19,680 = 4,320
3,360
4,320 -3,360 = 960
19,680 = 16 ? = 1,230

Answer to Question 34.6A BA 1

(a) Mark-up 1 3

therefore

Margin 1 = 1 (see text) = 25%
3+1 4

(b) 14,500 × 100 = 24.166% 60,000 1

(c) Such as: wastage; pilferage; sales at reduced prices; incorrect inventory valuation; arithmetical errors on selling prices.

(d) Trading Account for the year ending 31 December 2009 Sales Less: Cost of goods sold
Inventory 1 January 2009 Add: Purchases (47,000 + 5%) Less: Inventory 31 December 2009 (4,500 + 5%) Gross profit

3,000 49,350 52,350
4,725

60,000
47,625 12,375

(e)

45,500

= 45,500 = 12.133 times

(3,000 + 4,500) ÷ 2 3,750

(f ) Gross profit 14,500 - Expenses (10% of 60,000) 6,000 = Net profit 8,500.
(g) Amended net profit: Gross profit 12,375 - Expenses 6,000 = 6,375 Reduction compared with (f ) 8,500 - 6,375 = 2,125
As a percentage of (f ) 2,125 × 100 = 25% 8,500 1

(b) Inventory represents almost half the current assets ­ the acid test ratio is 0.63:1 compared with the current ratio of 1.16:1 ­ and, in the absence of any information on industry norms, this level of inventory appears to be too high. If the bank demanded payment of the overdraft, the company would face severe liquidity problems. It should probably try to reduce the level of inventory held and reduce the bank overdraft.

Answer to Question 47.2A BA 1

(a) (i) Gross profit as % of sales

Spendlight 430 × 100 = 17.2% 2,500 1

Easylawn 430 × 100 = 26.9% 1,600 1

(ii) Net profit as % of sales

166 × 100 = 6.6% 2,500 1

170 × 100 = 10.6% 1,600 1

(iii) Expenses as % of sales

264 × 100 = 10.6% 2,500 1

260 × 100 = 16.25% 1,600 1

(iv) Inventory turnover

2,070

= 10.1 times

(190 + 220) ÷ 2

1,170

= 8.7 times

(110 + 60) ÷ 2

(v) ROCE

166 × 100 = 45.1% 368 1

170 × 100 = 76.2% 223 1

(vi) Current ratio

399 = 2.1 189

199 = 5.2 38

(vii) Acid test ratio

179 = 0.95 189

39 = 1.03 38

(viii) Accounts receivable/sales ratio

104 × 12 = 0.5 months 2,500

29 × 12 = 0.2 months 1,600

(ix) Accounts payable/purchases ratio

189 × 12 = 1.08 months 2,100

38 × 12 = 0.37 months 1,220

(b) Easylawn is the more efficient company. It has made £170,000 profit as compared with £166,000 profit and has achieved a return on capital employed of 76.2% per cent, almost 70% higher than that of Spendlight, with 45.1%. Reasons: These are conjecture ­ you really have to know more about the businesses before you can be definite.
(i) Easylawn has managed to achieve a far greater percentage gross profit, whilst maintaining a reasonable level of sales.
(ii) Because expenses are lower, but gross profit is the same as for Spendlight, a higher figure of net profit is achieved by Easylawn.
(iii) Easylawn has kept inventory down to relatively lower figures than Spendlight, although Spendlight has managed to get higher rate of inventory turnover.
(iv) Easylawn has a 69% higher rate of return on capital employed, helped by lower inventory, better debt/sales ratio and relatively lower accounts payable.
(v) Acid test ratio with Easylawn appears healthier than with Spendlight.

Frank Wood and Alan Sangster, Business Accounting 1 & 2 Solutions Manual, 11th Edition 88 © Pearson Education Limited 2008

Answer to Question 47.5A BA 1
(a) (i) 40 × 100 = 25% 160 1
(ii) Cost of sales = 120 = 12 Average inventory 10
(iii) 32 × 100 = 20% 160 1
(iv) 32 × 100 = 25% 128 1
(v) 20 = 2 : 1 10
(vi) Accounts receivable and bank = 10 = 1 : 1 Accounts payable liabilities 10
(b) Although the gross profit percentage is the same, inventory turnover is down from 12 to 9. This would mean a relatively lower gross profit figure for CD. Net profit percentage is markedly lower, down from 20% to 10%. This implies that CD has far higher expenses than AB. For the amount of assets used AB is getting twice the return on them than CD, 25% compared with 121/2%. CD has kept current assets to a minimum ­ a figure of 1 : 1 is too low for comfort under normal circumstances. Similarly the quick asset ratio is too low. AB is by far the more successful business. It is turning over its inventory more frequently and has kept expenses under control. This has meant overall a return of 25% on its capital employed. It is also in a good liquid position and able to meet its debts. CD on the other hand is in a worse position on each factor. It is not only less profitable; it may well be unable to meet its debts as they fall due.

Answer to Question 47.6A BA 1

1 (i) Loan note interest has to be paid whether profits are made or not. Dividends on shares can only be paid if there are sufficient available profits.
(ii) Shareholders are part owners of the company and can exercise their powers with the votes at their disposal. Loan note holders normally have no voice in the running of the company.
(iii) If the company ceases to trade, then loan note holders are entitled to a full return of their money before the shareholders get anything.

(b) Your answer should be in report fashion. The main points you should cover include:
(i) The increase of sales by £20,000 from 2008 to 2009 has been accompanied by a fall in net profit ratio of 1.7%, and worse liquidity ratios. The acid test ratio shows that there may be difficulties in paying your debts soon.
(ii) The year to 2008 showed a considerable increase in profitability. Can this be maintained? (iii) Why has inventory increased to £30,000 at end of 2009? Does this show difficulties in achieving
sales? Investigate. (iv) If the above indicate problems in the future, what is the value of assets if sold at break-up prices? (v) A government investment involves no risk, except for inflation. (vi) Your return from Space Age should have a figure deducted for the value of your services. Only then
can we sensibly compare the return from the business with the return from the investment. (vii) There is a case for the investment in the loan stock being better than carrying on the business.

(i) Both have similar net profit percentage: A 3%; B 3.3%. However, result obtained very differently as A has high GP% and very high expenses, whereas B has lower GP% and relatively lower expenses.
(ii) Higher gearing of A leads to higher return on owners' equity. The extra debt of A could lead to problems when profits fall.
(iii) A's high accounts payable/cost of sales ratio is very worrying, as is the low current ratio. (iv) Figures considerably distorted by B's land revaluation. This leads to B's ROOE being understated,
whilst that of A ­ by comparison ­ is overstated.

(c) See text, but merits mainly concern tight control as HO can see what profits the branch ought to be making; also saves branch staff having to keep full accounting records. Demerits depend on whether branch staff are given room for initiative within the above system, or
else the HO stupidly lets the system strangle all initiative.

Notes: (A) See workings below. (B) Time basis. (C) Pro rata to sales. (D) The goodwill impaired is written-off against the pre-incorporation profit of £2,481, as are preliminary expenses (so far as possible).
The split of cost of sales is rather tricky. The answer will be demonstrated in an arithmetical, rather than algebraic, fashion:

Sales are: Pre-incorporation Post-incorporation

30,000 = 24% 95,000 = 76%

As post-incorporation cost of sales fell by 10% then the relationship between pre- and post-incorporation

cost of sales is:

Pre-incorporation

24

Post-incorporation 76% - (1/10 76%)

68.4

92.4

 Pre-incorporation costs are 80,000 × /100 924 × 24/100 = 20,779

Note: The proposed dividend is not relevant as it is an appropriation of profit and is not part of the calculation of profit.

Answer to Question 11.3A BA 2
(a) (i) Turnover should not include VAT on taxable outputs. It would be permissible to show gross turnover only where VAT is deducted to clearly describe turnover net of VAT.
(ii) Where there is irrecoverable VAT in respect of non-current assets, or other items needing disclosure, these should all be shown inclusive of VAT.
(b) (i) IAS 33 requires that earnings per share should be shown with the income statement for the current and preceding year.
(ii) Where the basic EPS differs materially from the diluted EPS, this should also be shown. (c) IAS 16 and IAS 36 require that the following are disclosed:
1 Methods of depreciation used. 2 Useful lives or the depreciation rates in use. 3 Total depreciation charged for the period. 4 Where material, the financial effect of a change in either useful lives or estimates of residual values. 5 The cost or revalued amount at both the start and end of the accounting period. 6 The cumulative amount of provisions for depreciation or impairment at the beginning and end of
the financial period. 7 A reconciliation of the movements, separately disclosing additions, disposals, revaluations, trans-
fers, depreciation, impairment losses, and reversals of past impairment losses written back in the period. 8 The net carrying amount at the beginning and end of the financial period. (i) depreciation methods in use; (ii) useful lives, or alternatively the depreciation rates; (iii) total depreciation for the period; (iv) gross amounts of these assets and accumulated depreciation. (d) IAS 38 ­ expenditure for research and development concerned with research to be written off immediately. (e) IAS 20 ­ such grants are to be: credited to profit and loss over expected useful life of the asset, by treating it as a deferred credit, where a proportion of it is transferred annually to profit and loss; Grants are not to be shown as part of shareholders' funds. (f ) IFRS 3 (Chapter 25) states that goodwill should be capitalised and shown on the face of the balance sheet. It should be reviewed annually for impairment. It should not be amortised. (g) IAS 8 and the Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements deal with this. Financial statements should be drawn up on the accrual basis and on the assumption that the entity is a going concern. See Chapter 13 Section 13.9 for a fuller answer. (h) The parent company should prepare consolidated accounts covering both of them. Uniform accounting policies should be used and, if possible, the same accounting date.

Answer to Question 11.4A BA 2

(a) (i) Leasehold land and buildings (IAS 16 and IAS 17) The total cost of £375,000 can be amortised over a period longer than the lease where there are
sufficient reasons for believing that the lease will be renewed for a further period. A more permanent state would appear to be indicated by the fact that £300,000 was spent on buildings; such a period would be permissible, given sufficient reasons regarding lease extensions.
(ii) Freehold land and buildings (IAS 16) Cost of building should be separated from that of land. Land (normally) is not to be depreciated.
Buildings are to be depreciated over normal expected useful life. Increase in value due to infla-
tion could result in a revaluation which in turn would mean increased charge for depreciation.
Costs of maintenance do not mean that depreciation should not be charged.
(iii) Plant and machinery (IAS 16) Depreciation rate to be fixed by reference to expected useful life. The degree of obsolescence and
the full physical life will have to be taken into consideration. Straight line 25 per cent would take only four years to write cost down to nil. On the other hand,
15 per cent reducing balance would take over three times that period. Some compromise between
these figures must be the obvious choice. If repairs and maintenance are likely to be light in early years and heavy in later years, it may make sense to use a fairly high rate using the reducing balance
method.
(iv) Research and development (IAS 38) The £250,000 spent on grass-cutting characteristics is purely research and should be completely
written off. It will depend on whether the £100,000 spent has resulted in an asset with a future which is
economically viable. If it has, then this sum can be written off over an appropriate period. The £75,000 for market research has not produced an identifiable product and consequently
should be written off.
(v) Inventory (IAS 2) Included in the balance sheet valuation should be all costs attributable to bringing the inventory
to its existing location and condition. Sales prices are only used in certain cases, e.g. in retailing where the usual gross profit percentage
is used to find cost price which will then be used for the valuation.

(b) (Figures in £000) Profit per draft accounts Add Amortisation of leaseholds added back (125 - 7.5)
Less: Depreciation of freeholds (assuming land is 200 and buildings 150) over 50 years Plant and machinery (assume 25% reducing balance) Research and development ­ write off Drive system treated as viable ­ to be written off over 4 years Market research

(b) In the long term, if a business is not profitable, it will not produce sufficient revenues to cover its expenses. Despite the importance of short-term cash flow to meet payments as they fall due, it is in the long-term interests of the business to invest in non-current assets, research and development, and advertising in order to generate future revenues in a profitable manner. Sometimes, management is accused of short-termism, for example delaying necessary capital expenditure in order to keep costs low. While this will indeed improve short-term cash flow, the long-term viability of the business can
be at risk.

Negative goodwill S2 Cost 30,500 - [75% of (36,000 + 4,800 + 1,800)] = 1,450

Elimination of negative goodwill of 1,450 uplifted for minority interest element in S2 to 1,450 plus

1,450 × 25/75 = 1,933 (to nearest £). Non-current assets in S2 reduced by 1,933. Minority interest in S2 =

Note Comprising: 31 October 2004: £260,000 - ((25% of £600,000 + 340,000) = £235,000) = 25,000
31 October 2008: £650,000 - ((50% of £600,000 + 420,000) = £510,000) = 140,000 165,000
Post first purchase profits 31 October 2004 to 31 October 2008 (25% of £80,000) ( 20,000)* 145,000
* This is the goodwill `lost' by delaying acquisition until 31 October 2008.

Answer to Question 20.4A BA 2
Shares bought Reserves at 31 December 2007 20,000 + 16,000 = Add proportion of 2008 profits before acquisition (1/4 × 24,000)
Proportion of pre-acquisition profits 175,000 × 42,000 = 200,000
Paid for shares 240,000 Therefore goodwill is 240,000 - 211,750 = 28,250

(c) The 63.8 million losses of Kasbah plc (the balance on reserves at 1 April 2003 was 45 million; at 3 March 2004 it was 18.8 million), could indicate a possible going concern problem that should be
investigated.

Answer to Question 26.4A BA 2
(a) Huge has 75% of Large's share capital. Large is therefore quite clearly a subsidiary undertaking and will be treated as such in the consolidated accounts. Huge has 25% of the ordinary share capital of Medium. This means that Medium is an associated or related undertaking. The equity method of accounting therefore applies under IAS 27, where the test of it is based on the ability to exert significant influence. Huge owns only 10% in Small and there is nothing stated in the question to suggest it should be treated as an associated undertaking. It will simply be shown as an investment.

Answer to Question 27.8A BA 2

Any ten ratios could be selected, but it would be expected that the selection would include ratios from each of the groups given in the chapter. In this case, the company appears as if it may have liquidity problems, possibly due to excessively high inventory. The gross profit percentage is not very high at 30%, and
much of it is eroded by the time all the other expenses have been charged to profit or loss. The EPS and dividend cover ratios would need to be compared to those of other companies in the same sector, as would
all the other ratios calculated, before any further conclusions could be drawn. It would also be interesting
to compare these ratios (and others) with the equivalent figures for the previous year.

(b) T is obviously the more efficient company. It has made £100,000 profit compared with the £60,000 profit of R and also has achieved a return on capital employed of 14.7%, almost three times that of R
(5.4%).
Reasons: These are conjecture ­ you really have to know more about the businesses before you can be definite.
(i) Somehow T has managed to achieve a far greater percentage gross profit while maintaining a reasonable level of sales.
(ii) Because expenses are lower, but gross profit is the same as for R, T has made the higher net profit. (iii) T has kept inventory down to relatively lower figures than R, something made possible by T's higher
level of inventory turnover. (iv) T has almost three times R's rate of return on capital employed, helped by lower inventory, better
accounts receivable : revenue ratio and relatively lower accounts payable.
(v) T appears to have far better control over its accounts receivables and its accounts payables than R.

Report to Martha The analysis of the results which are shown above indicates a major query associated with the expenses of the existing business in the second half of the year. Gross profit has declined by 3 per cent compared with the first half year but the expenses have increased from 40 per cent to 72 per cent of sales. Even if it is assumed that expenses are largely fixed for rent, business rates, etc. the absolute level has increased from £56,000 to £91,000, i.e. by £35,000 or 62.5 per cent in the six-month period. This is in a period when, for the existing business, revenue reduced from £140,000 to £126,000, i.e. by 10 per cent.
The inventory turnover figure indicates some improvement in the second half which is mainly attributable to the new business. This may not be an entirely acceptable measure until a further full halfyear's funding had been completed.
The return on capital employed is as follows (using the capital employed balances at the end of the period):

Capital employed Net profit Return

6 months to 30 Nov £90,000 £42,000
47%

6 months to 31 May 104,000 14,000
13%

12 months to 31 May 104,000 56,000
54%

Despite the decline in profits during the second half of the year, the return on capital employed is high at 54 per cent. Future trends in gross profit margins and the level of expenses need to be examined.

(ii) The main issue is the trend of declining liquidity over the year to 31 March 2005. If this trend continues, the business will be unable to meet its liability to creditors. It could, of course, be that major new funding is imminent for the issue of new long-term capital or rising volume/projects. If this is not managed, the owner needs to be advised of the necessity of urgent action.
(c) The balance sheet can be used to prepare a cash flow statement which indicates changes in source and application of cash balances. It will give some indication if comparisons are made over a period of time as to whether the business is investing and expanding or declining, and whether a proper capital structure is in place. The capital structure will depend on the nature of the business and the risks it is involved with, whether it is high or low geared for example. The balance sheet, being a position statement at one point in time, does not give a dynamic picture of future prospects which are essential in planning liquidity.

Answer to Question 28.7A BA 2

Note how the question has the years in the `wrong' columns ­ normally the previous year is on the far right. Examiners have been known to switch them, so always check which is which.

(a) Witton Way Ltd

The following six ratios could be calculated in answering this part of the question, but other relevant

ratios would be acceptable:

2005

2006

(i) Gross profit ratio

Gross profit × 100 Revenue

1,850 × 100 7,650

2,070 × 100 11,500

= 24.2%

= 18.0%

(ii) Return on capital employed
Profit before tax + long-term interest Share capital + reserves + loans and other borrowings

1,650 + 50

× 100

5,900 + 5,000 + 350

= 15.1%

1,500 + 350

× 100

5,900 + 5,700 + 3,350

= 12.7%

(iii) Acid test or quick assets or liquidity ratio

Current assets - Inventory Current liabilities

3,600 - 1,500 2,400

= 0.9

6,300 - 2,450 2,700
= 1.4

(iv) Trade accounts receivable collection period

Trade accounts receivable × 365 Credit sales

1,200 × 365 7,650

(v) Inventory turnover ratio

= 57 days

Inventory × 365 Cost of sales

1,500 × 365 5,800

(vi) Gearing

= 94 days

Long-term borrowings × 100 Shareholders' interest + long-term borrowings

350 × 100 10,900 + 350 = 3.1%

3,800 × 365 11,500 = 121 days

2,450 × 365 9,430 = 95 days

3,350

× 100

11,600 + 3,350

= 22.4%

(b) In making a comparison between the two years to 30 April 2005 and 30 April 2006 respectively (as required by part (a) of the question), the following points could be made:
1 Profitability (a) In absolute terms, revenue has increased by £3,850,000 (50.3%), the cost of sales by £3,630,000
(62.6%), and gross profit by £220,000 (11.9%). The company's gross profit on revenue has fallen from 24.2% to 18.0%, presumably because it reduced its selling price. (b) Other expenses have increased by £20,000 (13.3%), probably as a result of the increased sales activity. (c) To fund the extra expansion, it would appear that the company has borrowed another £3 million as a long-term loan. Hence, the interest charges have increased by £300,000. (d) Overall, the profit before tax has decreased by £100,000 although the tax based on profits is down by £50,000. (e) Not surprisingly, the company's return on its long-term funds employed was down from 15.1% to 12.7%. This is a most disappointing result after experiencing such a marked increase in its sales activity. A decrease in the selling price of goods apparently led to an increase in sales volume, but at the expense of overall profitability. (f ) In brief, it appears that the increase in the company's sales did not lead to a corresponding increase in profits. Indeed, the company was less profitable in 2006 than it was in 2005. It should also be noted that these results do not take into account the effects of inflation on the company's performance. Allowing for inflation would make the 2006 results even more disappointing.
2 Liquidity (a) At the end of 2005 the company has a healthy cash balance of £900,000. By the end of 2006, it was
down to £50,000 notwithstanding that the company had raised £3 million in long-term loans during the year. (b) However, its liquidity position appears to have improved in 2006 even though its cash position has declined so dramatically during the year. The company's current assets (excluding its inventory) more than cover its current liabilities in 2006, while in 2005 its current liabilities exceeded the current assets (excluding inventory) by some £300,000.
3 Efficiency (a) Bearing in mind the company's increased sales activity, its inventory at the end of 2006 compared with
2005 was proportionate to the increase in trading activity. At each year end the company held the equivalent of 95 days' sales in hand. (b) Its efficiency in dealing with its trade accounts receivable has, however, worsened. At the end of 2006, they represented 121 days' sales, whereas at the end of 2005 they represented just 57 days' sales (itself not a particularly low level). Of course this is not a surprising result since more generous credit terms were offered in 2006 in order to stimulate sales. The company has been able to finance this policy by running down its cash reserves and by increasing its long-term loans. In subsequent years it may not be possible to carry on with this policy unless it is able to raise even more long-term funds.
4 Shareholders' interests (a) Although the volume of its business increased dramatically, its profitability was down. Hence the com-
pany has maintained its dividend at the same level as in 2005. (b) By borrowing an extra £3 million, the company's interest charges have increased substantially,
although interest charges on loans outstanding at the year end fell from 14.2% to 10.5%. Thus at a time when profits were falling, the ordinary shareholders' dividend may have to be reduced in order to help pay the interest on the long-term debt, especially if even more funds have to be raised in 2007 and onwards. (c) In 2005 the gearing ratio was only 3.1% but by the end of 2006 it had risen to 22.4%. Nonetheless, Witton Way is still a low-geared company, and provided no more long-term loans are raised, the ordinary shareholders have little to fear ­ unless profitability continues to decline.
5 Conclusion In the short term the company's new policy appears to have failed. While its revenue has increased substantially, its overall profit is down, its liquidity is threatened and it has had to finance its increased sales activity by a considerable amount of extra borrowing. It would appear that the extra borrowing enabled it to finance its extended credit terms, as well as help to purchase new non-current assets ­ presumably to cope with the extra activity.
Frank Wood and Alan Sangster, Business Accounting 1 & 2 Solutions Manual, 11th Edition 156 © Pearson Education Limited 2008

(c) The following points could be made in answering part (c) of the question: 1 What was the effect of inflation upon the company's sales? 2 How many new customers were attracted to the company as a result of the extended credit terms and what extra volume of business did they bring? 3 What increase in sales was achieved by individual products? 4 Were the extended credit terms applied to all products? 5 Were all customers offered the extended credit terms? 6 Were more profitable products displaced by less profitable products? 7 Has the proportion of bad debts increased? 8 What effect has the increase in sales activity had on other costs? 9 To what extent has the expected depreciation rate on non-current assets been affected by the increased sales activity?
10 What facilities has the company arranged in order to finance the more generous credit terms in later years?

Gross profit fell in 2005 but rose sharply in 2006 ­ was this caused by an increase in sales prices or a
decrease in cost of sales? The additional investment in plant has brought a higher charge for depreciation and created a loan interest cost, but the amount of net profit is sharply up, almost in line with sales.

2 Inventory Closing inventory represent the following days' cost of sales:

20 × 365 = 35 days 207

45 × 365 = 76 days 215

85 × 365 = 83 days 373

Inventory now seem very high. Is this level necessary?

124 × 365 = 89 days 510

89 days seems high, even though a big improvement on 2005 figure. What terms are customers given?

4 Accounts payable Turnover of accounts payable should be calculated on purchases, not cost of goods sold. Purchases
cannot be calculated for 2004 but for the later years is:

Cost of goods sold Add Closing inventory
Less Opening inventory Purchases

2005 215 45 260 20 240

2006 373 85 458 45 413

Purchases for 2004 are taken as cost of goods sold.

20 × 365 = 35 days 207

80 × 365 = 122 days 240

35 × 365 = 31 days 413

The figures of 35 days and 31 days indicate a normal monthly credit period, but the figure of 122 days in 2005 seems strange, unless some large purchases were made just before the balance sheet date.

5 Working capital or current ratio

63 = 263% 24

161 = 166% 97

209 = 317% 66

6 Quick ratio or acid test

43 = 179% 24

116 = 120% 97

124 = 188% 66

Both the above series of figures show a satisfactory position but the difference between the two 2006 figures underlines the large investment in inventory at that date.

7 Gearing

317 : 0

325 : 0

445 : 200

Gearing is comfortably low after loan taken up in 2006.

8 Return on shareholders' funds

38 = 12.0% 317

35 = 10.8% 325

62 = 18.0% 345

2006 shows a welcome rise but all percentages are probably overstated as freehold land and buildings in the balance sheet are probably at original cost; if they have increased in value, shareholders' funds will be understated.
9 Conclusion Business appears sound and profitable. The investment in the new plant, part financed by a loan, has caused liquidity problems but these are probably only of a temporary nature.

(b) Answers to specific questions (i) A statement of cash flows best shows how a company can make a profit but still be short of cash.

Cash flows from operating activities Operating profit before taxation (62 + 30)
Adjustment for Depreciation
Operating cash flows before movements in working capital Increase in inventories Increase in accounts receivable Decrease in accounts payable

(ii) A balance sheet is not a valuation of a business but more like a historic record where non-current assets are concerned. Revaluations of non-current assets do take place in many companies, but these
are usually based on the views of professional valuers (e.g. chartered surveyors) and it is not good
practice to introduce guesses of current values. Any revaluation surplus would go to a revaluation
reserve and would not affect the declaration of annual profits (unless there were consequential
changes to the depreciation charge for the year).

Answer to Question 28.11A BA 2

(a) An Investor Sometown, UK

Dear Sir

Report on AA plc and BB plc

1 In accordance with your instructions, I give below my report on these companies which I hope may help you in deciding whether to proceed with a purchase of shares in either.

Balance sheets

2 AA has substantial freehold property. Such freehold property gives a large measure of solidarity to an investment, and also provides a useful security on which to borrow money if required. BB appears to own no freehold or leasehold property ­ at least, no entry for either appears in its bal-
ance sheet. 3 If one assumes that plant is depreciated on a straight line basis with no residual value, AA's plant
is 67% time-expired while BB's is much newer at only 22%. AA may therefore have to face the cost
of replacement before long.
4 AA has more than twice as much as BB tied up in inventory. Expressed in relation to usage (and taking sales less operating profit as the measure of cost of sales), AA's finished goods are 10 weeks' sales, while BB's are only 5 weeks'. The work in progress of AA is equal to 7 weeks' sales, while that of BB is 3 weeks'. As both companies carry on a similar trade, it is surprising that AA appears
to need a much larger investment in inventory ­ or is it just inefficiency? 5 Debtors of AA approximate to 17 weeks' sales, but those of BB are only 10 weeks'. Again, is this
inefficiency on the part of AA? 6 AA needs a bank overdraft, while BB is comfortably liquid. The current or working capital ratio of AA
is 188% against 133% of BB. The quick ratio in both companies is 100%. The working capital
situation in both companies is satisfactory but the need for the overdraft in AA underlines the high
stock and slow-paying debtors in that company. 7 Creditors in AA appear as 15 weeks' supplies and expenses, while in BB they are 25 weeks'. Both
these figures are astonishingly high when one considers that monthly account is the normal basis
of trade. How does BB get nearly half a year's credit? 8 Expressing gearing as Loans/Loans + Shareholders' funds, the gearing in AA is 1,400/3,700 or 38%,
while that in BB is 1,000/2,500 or 40%. Neither of these figures is regarded as high gearing.

Profit and loss accounts

9 Turning to the income statements, we find the following:

Operating profit as a percentage of revenue Net profit before tax Effective rate of tax Dividend yield on market price Dividend cover

AA 16% £70,000
29%
2.7%
1.25 times

BB 24% £360,000
25%
9.6%
2.1 times

10 BB appears both more efficient and more attractive to its shareholders, and of the two is clearly to be preferred as an investment.

Yours faithfully

I C Essay

(b) The P/E ratio of 30 for AA is surprisingly high, since even blue chip companies usually reach only 26 to 28, and there the expected profit growth is seen to be realised every year. What is AA's attraction to
investors? It is not to be seen in the 2007 financial statements. The market price of £1.50 still compares badly with its net asset value of £2.30, and one is left to guess that perhaps the trading results for 2007 were unexpectedly bad, and that it is the asset backing rather than the profits which has kept
the market price up. By contrast, the P/E ratio of 5 for BB is exceptionally low and such a figure is normally a warning to
prospective investors that the profits may be in danger of drying up shortly. The asset backing is £3.00 per share. At 9.6% yield, does the market know something bad about the company which we do not?
A dividend yield of only 4% or 5% is the normal expectation (and as low as 2% for many blue chip
companies).

Answer to Question 28.13A BA 2

(a) Profitability ratio
Gross profit as % revenue Net profit as % revenue Return on capital employed (using operating profit) Operating profit/revenue Distribution costs/revenue Administration expenses/revenue Return on shareholders' funds

2004 528/2,400 = 22% 138/2,400 = 5.7%
138/900 = 15.3% 138/2,400 = 5.7% 278/2,400 = 11.6% 112/2,400 = 4.7% 138/900 = 15.3%

2005 588/2,800 = 21% 142/2,800 = 5.1%
174/1,362 = 12.8% 174/2,800 = 6.2% 300/2,800 = 10.7% 114/2,800 = 4.1% 142/1,042 = 13.6%

(b) Liquidity ratios Current ratio Acid test ratio Inventory turnover* Accounts receivable/credit sales Accounts payable/purchases*

936/256 = 3.7:1
392/256 = 1.5:1
1,872/554 = 3.4 384/2,200 × 52 = 9.1 weeks 256/1,872 × 52 = 7.1 weeks

1414/338 = 4.2:1
754/338 = 2.2:1
2,212/660 = 3.4 644/2,640 × 52 = 12.7 weeks 333/2,328 × 52 = 7.5 weeks

* Opening inventory not known for 2004. Therefore the 2004 ratios must be calculated on closing inventory figures if comparison is to be drawn between the two years. The 2005 ratio if average inventory is used is 2,216/602 = 3.7.
Calculation of Purchases for 2005 is Opening inventory 544 + Purchases ? ­ Closing inventory 660 = 2,212. By arithmetical deduction, Purchases is therefore 2,328. Purchases for 2004 is taken (opening inventory not being known) as same as Cost of sales.

Comments (a) Profitability
Loan notes of £320,000 have been issued during the year. The income statement has thus had to bear an extra charge of £32,000 interest. If the rate of interest was 10%, this would mean the loan notes were issued on 1 January 2005, thus financing a full year's expansion.
The extra sales generated of 16.7% have been at the cost of cutting the gross profit percentage from
22% to 21%. The operating profit percentage has improved from 5.7% to 6.2%, possibly due partly to the fixed
element in distribution and administration costs and also improved efficiency by the use of the extra
loan capital being invested in better equipment. The return on capital employed, based on operating profit, has fallen from 15.3% to 12.8%. This
is because the profit generated from an increase in sales at a lower rate of profitability has not been
sufficient to compensate for the extra capital employed.
Possibly the programme of expansion was only partly completed during 2005 with benefits not
capable of being shown up until 2006 and later. Similar remarks also would apply to the return on
shareholders' funds.

(b) Liquidity Both the current ratio and the acid test (or quick) ratio have improved. This will be largely due to cash received from the issue of loan notes. The debtors are taking much longer to pay: 12.7 weeks instead of 9.1 weeks as previously. This raises the question as to the creditworthiness of the businesses to whom the extra sales have been made. Every sensible effort should be made to reverse the trend in the accounts receivable ratio. There is a large cash balance which does not seem to be making a return on its funds. This should be utilised more fully. It may of course be planned already to use it profitably.

Answer to Question 28.15A BA 2
From the ratios provided, you can obtain various indicators of whether the Eastown branch is being properly managed:
Return on capital employed: The better return of the Eastown branch suggests it is being well managed ­ it is earning £6 more (i.e. 37.5% more) per £100 invested than the overall average. However, some caution is needed in that analysis ­ while a consistent basis for the figures in the ratio is probable (as all the branches are in the same company), there is no guarantee that all have similar assets, either in nature or in age. Unless all the branches have similar asset profiles, the ratio result will be distorted. Further information will be needed.
Frank Wood and Alan Sangster, Business Accounting 1 & 2 Solutions Manual, 11th Edition 160 © Pearson Education Limited 2008

Gross profit: Over 15% lower than the overall average (at 38% compared with 45%), which suggests Eastown is not being managed as well as other branches. However, this could have arisen because the Eastown branch has been competing locally and has had to cut prices and offer incentives to retain and/or expand its customer base. Further information will be needed.
Selling and promotion costs/sales: The Eastown branch is spending 50% more per £100 of sales on promotion. While this could be an indicator of poor management, it is consistent with the suggestion, made above under gross profit, that the branch may have been competing locally (but, of course, promotion costs do not directly impact gross profit). Further information will be needed.
Wages/sales: Eastown is spending 35.7% more on wages per £100 of sales than the average (19% vs. 14%) ­ another possible indicator of poor management. However, it is also consistent with an attempt to retain and/or expand its customer base through an increased level of service (as a result of employing more staff). Further information will be needed.
Accounts receivable turnover: Eastown allows its customers 21% more time to settle their accounts than the average (63 days vs. 52 days) ­ another possible indicator of poor management. However, it is also consistent with an attempt to retain and/or expand its customer base through an increased level of service (as a result of employing more staff). Further information will be needed.
Inventory turnover: Turning over inventory virtually 25% quicker than the average (37 days vs. 49 days) suggests good management of this aspect of working capital. However, it may be caused by inefficient buying policies that are causing inventory shortages and loss of customers. Further information will be needed.
Overall: The ratios indicate a higher cost and lower profit profile exists at Eastown compared with the average. This may indicate poorer management, or may be due to the environment in which the branch is operating ­ it may, for example, be in competition with a price-cutting competitor.
Control over debtors appears weak, but may be due to a need to compete. The only positive ratio result is the lower inventory turnover period. However, it could actually be an indication that mismanagement is occurring.
The ratios in themselves are insufficient to draw any firm conclusions regarding the quality of management of the branch. However, they do indicate questions that should be asked and points that should be raised if an objective view on the quality of the branch's management is to be reached.

Answer to Question 28.16A BA 2
Ratios are used to assess managerial performance, and managers may be tempted to focus on producing `good' ratio results, rather than on producing the `best' performance for the company and its shareholders. Thus, short-termism may be adopted in order that profits are maximised in the short term.
For example, a policy may be adopted to purchase expensive assets that remain 90% unused, rather than renting them when required, as renting would reduce the profit of the company more than the depreciation charge on the assets. Another example would be whether or not to invest in a new production facility. If the company does, it will appear less profitable in the period up to when the new facility becomes productive and, thereafter, it will start becoming more profitable. A further example would be a form of `window dressing' whereby debtors are encouraged by discounts, or even coerced to settle their balances immediately before the end of the financial period ­ this could have the effect of customers moving their business elsewhere.
By their nature, accounting ratios take a short-term view. Shareholders are interested in the longer term. An aware reader of the financial statements will be able to apply the ratios to the longer-term horizon, and it is the aware reader that managers should be concerned about. By adopting a short-term focus, managers may actually be subject to harsher and more informed criticism than would have been the case had they focused upon the longer-term interests of the company.

Ascertaining an index for highly specialised assets can be difficult, and applying a general index may not give an accurate valuation. In addition, calculation of current costs takes time, particularly if the enterprise has a large number of different classes of assets.

(a) Cost behaviour refers to the manner in which costs arise, e.g. are they fixed for a period; do they change in proportion to the level of activity, etc. Analysis of total cost refers to the elements of specific total costs.
(b) · Factory power and lighting: would have a fixed element (light) and a variable element (power), and therefore semi-variable; however, would normally be classified as indirect factory expenses unless it was clear how much was incurred in producing each unit of the products, in which case, it could be split partly between direct costs and partly as indirect overheads.
· Production line workers' wages: a variable cost; would be analysed as a direct cost. · Sales manager's salary: a fixed cost; would be analysed as a selling and distribution expense. · Office rent: a fixed cost; would be analysed as an indirect administrative expense.

Answer to Question 36.2A BA 2

Answers to be drafted by students in proper memo form.
Introduction: Marginal cost is 3.2 + 4.8 + 1.6 = 9.6 Selling price - Marginal cost = Contribution to overheads and profit.
Projects which give negative contributions should be rejected. A change in volume can only be favourable where total contributions with new project are greater than total contributions without new project.

(a) Total contributions with new project £14.80 - £9.60 = £5.20 × 240,000 = £1,248,000 Total contributions without new project £15 - £9.60 = £5.40 × 200,000 = £1,080,000
Therefore accept reduction in selling price to £14.80

However, September sees a shortage of materials, so work out contribution per kilo of materials. This shows:
A £15 ÷ 5 kilos = £3 B £ 8 ÷ 6 kilos = £1.33 C £13 ÷ 4 kilos = £3.25
Total kilos used per month:
A 6,000 × 5 = 30,000 B 8,000 × 6 = 48,000 C 5,000 × 4 = 20,000
98,000

September delivery of material = 98,000 - 15% = 83,300 kilos; i.e. shortfall of 14,700. B has the lowest contribution, therefore restrict production by 14,700 ÷ 6 kilos = 2,450 units = 5,550.

Contributions: A 6,000 × £15 B 8,000 × £8 C 5,000 × £13

(d) This part of the question would include material from a number of different parts of the book. It can be answered at a straightforward level from the material in Chapters 35 and 36. However, a more complete answer would need to include material from Chapters 3, 37, 41 and 44. The answer requires
that you indicate that relevant costs and revenues would be identified; costs would be classified as fixed or variable, possibly across a range of different activity levels; contribution per unit would be
identified; break-even analysis would be undertaken; product mix may also be considered when a
multi-product company is involved; etc.

(c) It depends on where there are direct relationships to overheads. Number of hours worked is more appropriate in (b) (i) and (ii). However, machine hours method for its two departments has not yet
been investigated.

(d) There is no set answer. Basically, the absorption rate may be too high, making for an uncompetitive selling price; or too low, making the product too cheap and uneconomic.

(c) (i) Absorption rate based direct labour hours Dept A £210,000 divided by 25,000 hours = £8.4 per hour Dept B £175,000 divided by 50,000 hours = £3.5 per hour Dept C £150,000 divided by 60,000 hours = £2.5 per hour
(ii) Absorption rate based on machine hours Dept A £210,000 divided by 100,000 hours = £2.1 per hour Dept B £175,000 divided by 40,000 hours = £4.375 per hour Dept C £150,000 divided by 10,000 hours = £15 per hour

(d) (i) Allotment: this term is not generally used in relation to overheads. Presumably, the examiner wanted students to demonstrate that they realised it was not another term for either `allocation' or `apportionment'.
(ii) Allocation: attribution of costs to a cost centre or product based on some base that clearly identifies the expenditure that was incurred on that cost centre or product. This is used for the attribution of costs that can be specifically identified with a cost centre or product.
(iii) Apportionment: attribution of costs between a number of cost centres or products on the basis of some common base. For example, rates could be allocated to cost centres on the basis of the dimensions of their floor space. This is used for the attribution of costs that cannot be specifically identified as arising from the activities of one cost centre or product.

Answer to Question 37.11A BA 2
(a) (i) See text, Section 37.6. (ii) See text, Section 37.6. (iii) See text, Section 37.5. (iv) See text, Section 37.9. (v) Split-off point: the point at which joint products are separately identifiable.

Frank Wood and Alan Sangster, Business Accounting 1 & 2 Solutions Manual, 11th Edition 176 © Pearson Education Limited 2008

(b) (i) True: scrap has value, waste has none. (ii) True: a joint product is one that is produced by the same process and at the same time as another; a by-product is one that is produced incidentally as a result of manufacturing the main product.
They are further distinguished by their value. By-products have relatively little value compared
with the main products whose manufacturing process created them. Joint products are each of
significant value compared with their own joint product(s).

Answer to Question 38.3A BA 2

(a) (i) Always able to satisfy customers' demands; strike in firm's production could stop production of new inventory; strike at suppliers of part could stop production of new inventory.
(ii) So as not to have to lay-off workers; lower costs of production; administratively easier and cheaper.

(b) Opening inventory Produced
Less Sales Closing inventory
Inventory (by deduction) 1 July: 270 units.

(b) Briefly: full answer to be in report form. (i) Current ratio 31.8.2011 is 420,900 : 350,500 = 1.2 : 1. However, acid test ratio shows 21,000 : 350,500 = 0.06 : 1. This latter ratio reveals considerable liquidity problems. Forecast shows a fall in bank overdraft of £36,700 over the period. The overdraft is still far too high.
(ii) Find out contributions made by each depot. Reduce inventory. Sell off some non-current assets? Reduce overhead costs. See if gross profit margins can be increased, either by increasing prices or by better buying policies at cheaper prices.

(b) See text.
(c) Items in the letter should include reference to the 3% discount on purchases in May and June. It is probably unwise to attempt to take advantage of the discount. The increase in the overdraft facility required is entirely due to it and the increased overdraft costs would make the actual saving much less than at first appeared. If June purchases were kept to around £76,000 it appears that the overdraft limit would not need to be raised. It may be worthwhile for Belinda to consider negotiating purchasing on credit from her suppliers. She may also consider offering less credit to her customers, etc.

Answer to Question 42.6A BA 2

Central Grid plc It can be assumed that there has been a planning change concerning the volume of production, reducing it from 16,000 units to 12,000. Flexible budgeting can be adopted (see Section 39.5 in the text) and a revised original budget of 12,000 units used. Assume that all the various standard costs and usage level
relationships would be unchanged at the lower level of output and calculate the variances requested on the basis that the budgeted volume was 12,000. This produces the following:

(a) Total Direct Material Variance for April 2008

£60,000 - £60,390

= £390

(i) Material Usage Variance

(12,000 - 12,830) × £5

= £4,150

(ii) Material Price Variance

(£5 - £4.70694) × 12,830

=

£3,760

Adverse Adverse Favourable

(b) Total Direct Labour Variance for April 2008

£144,000 - £153,000

= £9,000

(i) Labour Efficiency Variance

(36,000 - 34,000) × £4

= £8,000

(ii) Labour Rate Variance

(£4.00 - £4.50) × 34,000

= £17,000

Workings: Material usage Material unit price Standard labour cost for output

£64,150 ÷ £5 = 12,830 £60,390 ÷ 12,830 = £4.70694 £12 × 12,000 = £144,000

Adverse Favourable Adverse

(c) Material: Shows an overall adverse variance of £390. Usage: Adverse £4,150. Used more material than expected for this level of output. Could have been because the material was of poorer quality (it was cheaper than expected). Price: Favourable variance £3,760. Purchasing obtained material at a lower price than expected.
Labour: Shows an overall adverse variance of £9,000. Efficiency: Favourable £8,000. Perhaps using a different machine from usual? Or, perhaps working harder in order to receive the higher than expected wage rate. Rate: Adverse £17,000. Higher labour hourly cost, possibly because the amount of work was lower than expected.
Polishing labour efficiency variance: The £3,000 adverse variance may have been due to the possibly poorer quality material used in machining having caused polishing to take longer than expected.

(d) Briefly: Material: Possibly poorer quality material was used (it was cheaper than expected), resulting in waste. If so, it appears it cost more (in waste) than it saved (in reduced purchasing costs). It also appears that
it may have led to the adverse polishing labour efficiency variance.
Labour: Higher wage rates than were expected led to a significant increase in cost. These increased wage rates may have resulted from the change in the planned level of activity from 16,000 units to 12,000.

Answer to Question 42.8A BA 2
(a) See text.
(b) (i) Total materials variance: (Standard price × standard quantity) - (actual price × actual quantity) = (£8.42 × 1,940) - (£8.24 × 2,270) = £16,334.8 - £18,704.8 = £2,370 adverse.
(ii) Materials price variance: (Standard price - actual price per unit) × quantity purchased = (£8.42 - £8.24) × 2,270 = £408.60 favourable.
(iii) Material usage variance: (Standard quantity required - actual quantity) × standard price = (1,940 - 2,270) 330 × £8.42 = £2,778.60 adverse.
(iv) Total labour variance: (Standard rate × standard hours) - (actual rate × actual hours) = (£6.53 × 800) - (£6.14 × 860) = £5,224 - £5,280.4 = £56.4 adverse.
(v) Wage rate variance: (Standard rate - actual rate) × actual hours worked = (£6.53 - £6.14) × 860 = £335.40 favourable.
(vi) Labour efficiency variance: (Standard hours - actual hours) × standard rate = (800 - 860) × £6.53 = £391.80 adverse.

(ii) Standard costing uses standards of performance and of prices derived from studying operations and of estimating future prices. Each unit produced attracts a standard materials, labour and overhead cost.
Flint Palatignium negotiates fixed-price contracts utilising standard costing which enables it to set standards that will remain unchanged for long periods. For example, the average cost method of pricing
material issues needs a price recalculation each time there are additional receipts. The standard cost of
materials will remain unchanged for a long period.
Using the standard costing system would enable the company to check on the efficiency of the service
provided. It would also enable faster reporting to be carried out.

(c) The report should include the following: 1 Marginal costing takes account of the variable costs of products. 2 It states that fixed factory overhead is a function of time and should not be carried forward into the next period by including it in inventory valuations. 3 To apply marginal costing means splitting up fixed and variable costs. This is not always straightforward. 4 Not all variable costs are a hundred per cent variable. 5 Intelligent cost planning and control is dependent on the knowledge of how costs behave in a particular firm. 6 Raw materials are examples of variable costs. Labour costs usually move in steps.

Answer to Question 44.11A BA 2

(a) See text, Section 44.1. (It should be remembered that a break-even point is relevant only to a specific range of activity and within a specific timescale. If the volume of activity shifts onto a new level, some fixed
costs may alter ­ for example, a second warehouse may need to be rented. This will result in a different
break-even point. Also, the break-even point will alter over time as the nature of all costs change.)

(b) (i)

Cost of 2,000 additional units Direct materials Direct labour Overheads

(36,000 - 30,000) (33,000 - 28,000) (24,100 - 20,500)

6,000 5,000 3,600 £14,600

(ii) Based on the cost for 2,000 units calculated in (i), the variable costs of 10,000 units would be £73,000.
(iii) There appears to be a fixed element in both direct labour and overheads. In the case of direct labour, this would appear to be £3,000 [£28,000 - (5 × £5,000)]. In the case of overheads, it appears to
be £2,500 [£20,500 - (5 × 3,600)].
(iv) On the basis of (ii) the variable cost of one unit is £7.30 and the contribution per unit is £5 [£12.30 - £7.30]. Break-even point is 1,100 units [(£3,000 + £2,500)/£5].

Answer to Question 45.2A BA 2

The amount borrowed is £3,842.20 and the interest charged is £157.80. Therefore, the real rate of interest:

r = 157.80

= 0.2342 or 23.42%.

£5,000 will accumulate to £5,000 × (1 + 0.035)8 = £6,584.04 Interest is £6,584.04 - £5,000 = £1,584.04

Answer to Question 45.6A BA 2

r = (4,400/2,500) - 1 = 11.2%

Answer to Question 45.8A BA 2
£50,000 = 10 5,000
Therefore, from Table 4 in Appendix 1, and using the 12 year line, it lies between 2% and 3%: 2% = 10.575 3% = 9.954 Difference = 0.621
Interpolating, 10 - 9.954 = 0.046 and = 46 × 1 = 0.07 621
Therefore the offer represents a rate of interest of 3% - 0.07% = 2.93%. This is well below the 6% compound interest you could obtain by investing the £50,000 and confirms that you should accept the offer.

Answer to Question 45.10A BA 2
Paid in per year = Value × (r) (1 + r)n - 1
= £40,000 × 0.07 (1.07)8 - 1
= £3,898.71 per year

(c) The calculations of net present values indicate that the Ohio investment produces a higher NPV over the four-year period. In order to determine whether this represents a reasonable decision, the management would need to consider the reliability of estimates used ­ on volumes, sales forces and costs. Exco involves a lower capital outlay, which is expected to produce a payback just before the end of 2006.
Ohio does not achieve payback until over 6 months through the fourth year. Ohio only really comes into profit in the fourth year. If these fourth year estimates are reliable, and may extend into the future period after 2008, then Ohio is clearly preferable. The method using net present value is entirely appropriate, assuming that the cost of capital figure has been reliably estimated. However, the NPV
can only be valued if the information on which it is based is accurate. Great care must be taken to
assess the sensitivity of the data to changes in the inputs in order to be aware of the underlying risks
involved.

Report to Rovers Football Club The proposed transactions have been evaluated in Exhibits A, B and C to calculate the likely returns from the two players. On the figures quoted, both transactions produce a positive net present value using 12% interest, with the Jimmy Jam proposal providing the higher of the two. However, the club should consider
the fact that the J Star proposal provides a payback in the first year whereas the J Jam transfer would not
achieve payback until after six months through year 2. If J Jam is successful, his five-year contract will provide benefits for three years more than J Star. In both
cases the whole proposal hinges on the validity of the assumed increase in revenue and the probability that
the players will be fit to play and be popular with the crowds.
