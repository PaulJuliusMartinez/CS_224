Multiplayer Games
Players i = 1...n each with a finite set of pure strategies Ai for simplicity we will assume that the action chosen by player i ai  {0, 1}, (binary actions)

Normal Form
The payoffs to player i are given by a matrix Mi This matrix is indexed by a joint action a  {0, 1}n The value Mi (a) (wlog  [0, 1]) is the payoff for player i if players play the joint action a

Normal Form (mixed strategies)
In our binary setting a mixed strategy for player i is given by the probability pi  [0, 1] that the player will play 0 The expected payoff to player i from the joint mixed strategy p is then defined as
Mi (p) = Eap[Mi (a)]

Nash Equilibrium
p[i : p슬 ] denotes the joint mixed strategy which is the same as p except that player i deviates to p슬 Then p is a NE for the game iff i, p슬  [0, 1]
Mi (p)  Mi (p[i : p슬 ])

-Nash Equilibrium
p[i : p슬 ] denotes the joint mixed strategy which is the same as p except that player i deviates to p슬 Then p is a -NE for the game iff i, p슬  [0, 1]
Mi (p) +  Mi (p[i : p슬 ])

Issues with Normal Form
Assuming n players and 2 actions, as we have here, leads to the need for : n matrices Mi (one for each player) each of size 2n

Issues with Normal Form
Assuming n players and 2 actions, as we have here, leads to the need for : n matrices Mi (one for each player) each of size 2n
Furthermore tabular form fails to capture structure inherently present in the game

Structure in Games
It is assumed that the payoff Mi for player i is a function of all the components aj , (j = 1....n) in the joint action vector a However the payoff for player i may be dependent only on the actions of a subset of players N(i) - conditional independence payoff assumption

Graphical Games Payoff Representation
Local payoff matrix for M슬 depends only on the actions taken by players in N(i)
Mi (a) = M슬 (a[N(i )])

Representation Complexity
|N(i)| is the degree of local interaction for node i
The maximum k over the graph k = maxi |N(i)| defines the complexity of the representation O(n2k)
