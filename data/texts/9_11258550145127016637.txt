1 Introduction

This report summarises work on Work Package 3 of the project. The aim is to combine the singlesite methodology developed in Work Packages 1 and 2 with the spatial-temporal modelling techniques from project FD2105, to produce a tool for generating multi-site sequences of subdaily rainfall incorporating scenarios of climate change.
The main steps in the proposed procedure are as follows:

1. Fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) simultaneously to daily rainfall data from several sites in the catchment of interest, using grid box averaged values of atmospheric variables such as temperature, sea level pressure and humidity as covariates.
2. Use the GLM to generate multi-site daily rainfall series over the time period of interest. If this time period is in the past, historical values of the atmospheric variables can be used to drive the simulations; if it is in the future, the required values can be derived from the suitably normalised outputs from numerical climate models. It is, of course, possible, to use "historical" climate model outputs to drive the simulations as well, if desired.
3. Use the multi-site rainfall disaggregator recommended in FD2105, to take the daily sequences from the GLM and convert them to the corresponding hourly sequences.

The methods for steps 1 and 2 are straightforward extensions of the methods for generation of single-site daily rainfall, described in FD2113 Project Reports 2 and 3 (Leith, 2005, 2006).
Since both components of the procedure (the GLMs and the multi-site disaggregator) have been tested extensively in projects FD2105 (Wheater et al., 2006) and elsewhere in FD2113, the work reported here is confined to an illustrative example as described in the original project proposal. However, we also take the opportunity to explore the effect of temporal resolution of atmospheric variables on the simulated rainfall sequences. Specifically, we compare the effects of using daily instead of monthly values of the atmospheric variables; we also examine the effects of removing seasonality. This investigation complements the work of Buishand et al. (2004), who used GLMs to examine the effect of temporal resolution of atmospheric and precipitation data simultaneously (i.e. to compare the relationship between monthly atmospheric and precipitation data with that for daily data). They found that the temporal resolution does not affect general conclusions regarding coarse-scale properties such as changes in annual rainfall amounts, but that some relationships between precipitation and atmospheric variables are stronger in fine-resolution data.
Several methods have been proposed in the literature for the generation of multi-site sequences of daily rainfall. These include transforming the rainfall distribution to approximate normality, with zeroes corresponding to negative transformed values (Durban and Glasbey, 2001); techniques based on resampling (Buishand and Brandsma, 2001; Wilby et al., 2003); those based on unobserved underlying weather states (Charles et al., 1999); and artificial neural networks (Harpham and Wilby, 2005). In previous work (Yang et al., 2005) it has been shown that multisite GLM simulations

2 DATA USED

are able to reproduce a wide range of observed rainfall properties with relatively small computational cost, and within a flexible and interpretable modelling framework; in our view they compare favourably with other currently available multi-site simulation methods.
By contrast with the daily case, far less work has been done on the generation of multi-site rainfall at a subdaily timescale. Indeed, apart from the methodology of Segond et al. (2006) used here, the only work we are aware of that allows the possibility of incorporating temporal nonstationarity into multi-site subdaily sequences is that of Fowler et al. (2005). These authors estimated separate sets of subdaily rainfall model parameters for different `weather states'; the implication is that nonstationary simulations will be obtained if the relative frequencies of the different states change in an altered climate. We have briefly investigated the `weather state' approach as part of this project; however, we found it difficult to obtain reproducible results, and concluded that the approach may not be suitable for use with all UK rainfall datasets.
In Section 2 we describe the data used in our illustrative example. The fitting and simulation of GLMs are described in Section 3, and the disaggregation to an hourly timescale in Section 4. The work is summarised in Section 5.

2 Data used
2.1 Daily raingauge data
The daily raingauge data used here are from a network of 34 gauges run by the UK Meteorological
Office. The gauges are in the 50km × 40km catchment of the River Blackwater in Surrey. The data
run from 1961 to 2000, and were also used in FD2105. Further details are given in Wheater et al. (2006, Chapter 9) and in Yang et al. (2005).
2.2 Hourly raingauge data
For the generation of multi-site sequences at a subdaily timescale, hourly data at a site in or near the catchment of interest are required. We do not have access to hourly data from within the Blackwater catchment, and have therefore used instead a long hourly record from Heathrow airport which is approximately 8km from the northern edge of the study area. Attention is restricted to data from 1961 to 1990, so as to take advantage of models fitted as part of Work Package 2.1 (Leith, 2006).
2.3 Atmospheric variables
Gridded values of temperature, sea level of pressure and relative humidity have been used to drive the rainfall models in this exercise. The justification for this choice of variables is given in Leith (2005, Section 3.3). Data for the 1961­2000 period are taken from the NCEP reanalysis dataset
(Kalnay et al., 1996). The original NCEP data have been regridded onto a 2.5 × 3.75 grid, for

3 GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS -- FITTING AND SIMULATION

compatibility with the climate model data considered below. To obtain a single time series for each variable, a weighted average of grid squares is used; the weights are based on the distances from the centre of the Blackwater catchment, and are calculated in the same way as for the single-site work in Work Packages 1 and 2.
In Work Packages 1 and 2, monthly averages of the atmospheric variables were used, and these were standardised with respect to mean and standard deviation for each month of the year. Here, we investigate the effect of temporal resolution and standardisation upon the properties of the simulated rainfall sequences. In Section 3, models are fitted and simulated separately using each of the following atmospheric data series:
Series A: Monthly data, standardised by month as in Work Packages 1 and 2.
Series B: Monthly data, obtained by first standardising the daily data with respect to the overall 1961­1990 mean and standard deviation and then calculating the monthly means of the standardised daily series.
Series C: Daily data, standardised by month.
Series D: Unstandardised daily data.
Series A and C are, in effect, seasonally adjusted whereas Series B and D are not.

2.4 Climate model data
The NCEP data have been used to establish empirical relationships between multisite rainfall and atmospheric variables. To produce scenarios of future rainfall, future values of the atmospheric variables are needed. These are obtained here from the output of seven different numerical climate models. The models, and SRES `A2' forcing scenario, are the same as those used in Work Packages 1 and 2 -- see Leith (2005, Section 3.2) for an overview. For each climate model, a weighted average of gridded data has been computed in the same way as for the NCEP data. However, only one series has been used from each climate model: this is a monthly series, standardised with respect to that climate model's mean and standard deviation for each month of the year during the 1961­1990 period. This corresponds to the use of NCEP Series A. One of the reasons for not considering daily climate model data is that some of the climate models have only 30 days in every month, which causes problems with the temporal alignment of data files.

3 Generalized Linear Models -- fitting and simulation
3.1 Overview of modelling approach
A GLM for daily rainfall is specified in two parts, as described in Chandler and Wheater (2002) and Yang et al. (2005). Firstly, rainfall occurrence is modelled using logistic regression; and then

3 GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS -- FITTING AND SIMULATION

4

wet day rainfall amounts are modelled using gamma distributions. In Yang et al. (2005), GLMs were fitted to the Blackwater dataset, using the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) as a covariate and setting to zero all daily rainfalls below 0.5mm in an attempt to resolve gross spatial inconsistencies associated with the reporting of small amounts. In the work reported here, we have essentially taken the models reported in that paper, deleted terms involving the NAO and added terms corresponding to the atmospheric variables. Five separate versions of both occurrence and amounts models have been fitted. The first contains no atmospheric covariates and serves as a baseline against which to judge the others, which themselves differ with respect to the time scale and standardisation of the atmospheric covariates as described previously.
Model fitting was carried out using the GLIMCLIM software package (Chandler, 2002), broadly following guidelines in the GLIMCLIM manual to decide which covariates to include in each model. The following categories of covariate were considered:
· Covariates representing systematic regional variation over the catchment. Site altitude was
considered for this purpose, along with Legendre polynomial transformations of Eastings and Northings. No polynomial of degree higher than 2 was used, since the catchment is relatively small and homogeneous so that complex regional variation is unlikely. We note that if cubic polynomial terms are added to the models, they yield significant improvements in fit as measured by the dependence-adjusted likelihood ratio statistic (Chandler and Bate, 2007). However, on closer inspection it appears that the improvement in fit is largely due to improvements at one or two individual sites, and that the fitted spatial surfaces vary too much to be plausible. Since it is known that multi-site daily rainfall data can exhibit spatial inconsistencies even after thresholding (Yang et al., 2006), we suspect that the `significant' improvement in model fit is caused by overfitting artefacts of the data.
· An indicator variable taking the value 1 before 1975 and 0 afterwards. This is used to adjust
for a resolution change, caused by the move from imperial to metric measurement units in the mid 1970s. As discussed by Yang et al. (2006), failure to account for such a resolution change can lead to the identification of spurious trends, particularly in rainfall occurrence.
· Seasonal effects, represented via sine and cosine terms.
· Previous days' rainfalls, represented in the occurrence models using the proportion of `wet'
sites on previous days and in the amounts models using the mean rainfall at all sites. Both models also included `persistence' terms representing the proportion of sites experiencing rain on two or three previous days in succession.
· Atmospheric variables, as described previously.
· Interactions between `previous days' and `seasonal' terms. The presence of such an interac-
tion implies a seasonally varying autocorrelation structure.
· Interactions between `previous days' terms and the pre-1975 indicator. It is necessary to
consider these interactions, to account for the change in the properties of previous days' recorded rainfall resulting from the move to metric measurement units.

3 GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS -- FITTING AND SIMULATION

· Interactions between the atmospheric and seasonal variables.
· Interactions between the atmospheric and `regional' variables.
· Interactions between the atmospheric and `previous days' variables. In general, some care
needs to be taken with interactions of this sort since they represent changes in the dynamical properties of the models and, if the future values of the atmospheric variables change too much relative to their historical values, the model simulations will become unstable (Leith, 2005, Section 4). Nonetheless, such interactions are retained here in the first instance.
To simplify the process of model development, once the baseline models had been developed the only interactions considered were those involving atmospheric variables.
At this point it is worth considering how the temporal resolution of the atmospheric variables might affect the fitted models. It seems reasonable to expect that rainfall on a particular day will be more closely related to the atmospheric conditions on that particular day than to the mean conditions for the month, and hence that models conditioned on daily data will fit better (in terms of both explained variation and log-likelihoods) than those conditioned on monthly data. However, it is not clear that the properties of the simulated sequences will differ to any great extent, the reason being that day-to-day variation in the atmospheric predictors will be subsumed into the stochastic and `previous days' components of any model conditioned on monthly data.
In a similar vein, we can consider the effects of deseasonalising the atmospheric variables. On physical grounds, one might expect that most of the seasonal structure in rainfall sequences can be explained in terms of dependence upon atmospheric conditions that are themselves seasonally varying, and hence that using unstandardised atmospheric variables will eliminate the need for separate seasonal covariates. Conversely, the sine and cosine terms in the models are designed to deal with any residual seasonality in the rainfall, that cannot be explained using the atmospheric variables.

3.2 Fitting results
The GLIMCLIM summaries of the covariates in the final models, along with the coefficient estimates and their standard errors, are given in Appendix A. The main points arising from these summaries are as follows:
· The baseline models are similar to those obtained for the Blackwater catchment in FD2105
and reported in Wheater et al. (2006). There are some minor differences in the representation of regional and previous days' effects, which eliminate the need for a separate February adjustment in the occurrence model.
· Each amounts model is simpler than the corresponding occurrence model. This is typical, in
our experience.

3 GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS -- FITTING AND SIMULATION

· The effects of the atmospheric variables are significant and (judging by the number of inter-
action terms) complex, regardless of the standardisation and time resolution used.
· Some of the sine and cosine terms are still significant in models based on NCEP Series
B and D, although by and large the significance is much reduced by comparison with the models involving deseasonalised atmospheric variables. This suggests that the atmospheric variables are able to account for most, but not all, of the seasonality in the rainfall.
· The coefficients associated with previous days' rainfall are much smaller in the models using
daily atmospheric covariates (Series C and D). This is because for these models, some of the autocorrelation in the rainfall can be attributed to weather-scale variability in the atmospheric variables; for the remaining models, the only way to model autocorrelation is through dependence on previous days' rainfall. However, the previous days' rainfall coefficients remain highly significant in all models; the atmospheric variables therefore do not explain all of the autocorrelation.
· The models based on daily atmospheric covariates are more complex than those based on
monthly values. This is because the daily covariates are related more directly to the rainfall so that there is more clear structure for the models to capture. This is essentially the same result as that obtained by Buishand et al. (2004).
· The `pre-1975' indicator is rarely significant. It has been retained in the occurrence models,
however, since it represents a known effect that should be adjusted for. As far as rainfall amounts are concerned, the effect of the resolution change is effectively negligible (Yang et al., 2006), so the indicator has been omitted from the amounts models.
All of the occurrence models are fitted to exactly the same data set, consisting of 230,881 daily values in total. Similarly, all of the amounts models have been fitted to data from the same 97,103 `wet' days (this effectively means days with rainfall in excess of 0.5mm). It is therefore legitimate to compare summaries of model fit and predictive performance. To this end, Table 1 shows the independence log-likelihoods achieved by each model, along with the mean Brier score for occurrence models, and proportion of variance explained for amounts. The mean Brier score is
the average value of (Yst - pst )2, where Y takes the value 1 if site s is wet on day t and 0 otherwise and pst is the corresponding probability of rain under the model: better models should yield smaller
mean Brier scores.
Due to dependence among the sites used for fitting, the log-likelihoods in Table 1 cannot be used as a formal basis for comparison. Nonetheless, the message is very clear: according to all measures, monthly atmospheric variables yield a slight improvement over the baseline models, but daily variables produce a much better fit. As noted previously, this is not unexpected; indeed, it is perhaps surprising that the daily atmospheric variables do not explain more of the variance in rainfall amounts. This may be due to their coarse spatial resolution. A further feature from Table 1 is that the performance summaries seem little affected by the removal of seasonality from the atmospheric variables.

Table 1: Summaries of model performance for GLMs fitted to Blackwater data.

As an initial check on the fitted models, Pearson residuals have been computed separately for each month, site and year. Graphical summaries of these residuals are presented in Appendix B. The main points to note are:
· For the occurrence models, there are no discernible seasonal patterns or trends in the resid-
uals, except for the models involving daily (Series C and D) atmospheric variables. For these models, the residuals show clear seasonal structure and also an apparent downward trend from the late 1980s onward (Figures B4 and B5). The seasonal structure could in principle be removed by adding further terms to the model (for example, sine and cosine terms with sixmonth cycle lengths); however, this would increase the complexity of models that are already large.
· For the amounts models, there are no clear patterns in the monthly or annual mean residuals,
except possibly for a period of increased variability around 1970. The standard deviations for all models show some seasonal structure, with slightly more variability in the summer than in the winter. This phenomenon was noted by Yang et al. (2005), and suggests that there may be a problem with the assumption of a constant shape parameter for the gamma rainfall amounts distributions. The structure is relatively weak, however, and experience to date suggests that the effect on properties of simulated data is relatively minor (the results reported below are typical).
· The pattern of mean residuals at each site is almost identical, regardless of the atmospheric
variables used in the models. The mean residuals from the occurrence models differ significantly from zero at more sites than those for the amounts models. However, there is no clear structure to the the plots: for example, the mean residuals at adjacent sites B19 and B20 are both significantly different from zero but have opposite sign. These residuals are therefore more likely to be associated with inconsistent reporting of small amounts (despite the use of thresholded data to try and reduce this problem) than with genuine rainfall structure.

3.3 Simulation results
In this section we compare the simulation performance of the fitted models. As noted previously, it is not clear that differences in predictive performance will lead to differences in the properties of the simulated sequences, since the stochastic components of the models will compensate to some extent for differences in the systematic components.
The simulation setup is the same as that in Yang et al. (2005), except that all simulations are carried out over the 1961­1990 period. Attention is restricted to 10 sites that have relatively few missing values over this period. Initially, 10 imputations of the missing values are carried out using each set of atmospheric variables, and summary statistics are computed for each of the resulting `complete' data sets; the variability in the resulting summaries gives an indication of the historical uncertainty due to missing data. Next, 100 simulations of each model are run for the 1961­1990 period, using data from December 1960 to initialise each simulation and using the historical values of the NCEP-derived atmospheric variables where required. The same summary statistics are computed for the simulated data, and the distributions of these are compared with the observed values.
The first statistics examined are the summer (JJA) and winter (DJF) rainfall totals in each year of the simulation period, averaged over all 10 sites used in the simulation study. The results for the various models are shown in Figures 1 to 5. Note firstly that the simulated distributions for

the baseline models (Figure 1) are roughly constant from year to year. This is to be expected, since according to the baseline models the distributions in each year should be identical. It is more interesting to see the effects of the atmospheric variables in Figures 2 to 5. Here, the simulated distributions (especially those based on the daily atmospheric series C and D) are much narrower and track the observed series more closely. The simulated distributions appear tighter when the atmospheric variables are not seasonally adjusted (Series B and D), although there is a tendency for these simulated distributions to be slightly too high in winter (the winter observations fall mostly in the lower half of the simulated distributions in Figures 3 and 5).
It is, of course, to be expected that daily atmospheric variables should produce tighter simulated distributions at any particular time point than their monthly counterparts. However, for future scenario generation the exact daily values of atmospheric variables are unknown: if we simply take daily output from a climate model and use it to drive a GLM simulation, the simulated distributions for any particular time point will be tightly clustered, but this will not reflect the true uncertainty regarding future rainfall at that time point. For scenario generation, it is therefore more appropriate to examine the variability in summary statistics computed over an extended period. To this end, we have computed a variety of statistics for the 1961­1990 period, for each site individually as well as for time series obtained by averaging over groups of sites. From here on, most of the results from atmospheric series A and B are indistinguishable, as are those from series C and D; the results from the baseline model are of little interest. Therefore most results are presented for series A and D only.
Figures 6 and 7 show the summary statistics for a single site (B15 -- see the plots of residuals by site in Appendix B for location), for models driven by atmospheric series A and D respectively. Figures 8 and 9 show the same summary statistics for the average of three sites (B18, B19 and B20). There is generally good agreement between simulated distributions and observations. The similarity between the results driven by monthly (Series A) and daily (Series D) variables is striking. The main differences are as follows:
· The proportion of wet days is less variable under Series D (daily) than Series A (monthly). A
similar comment applies to the mean, albeit to a lesser extent.
· The autocorrelations are slightly less well reproduced under Series D than under Series A;
specifically, the Series D autocorrelation distributions have little seasonal structure and there is a tendency to underestimate the Lag 1 autocorrelation.
The next check is for the distributions of rainfall amounts on wet days. Figures 10 and 11 show quantile-quantile plots of the observed and simulated wet day rainfall distributions. Here, each missing observation was replaced by the median of the 10 imputed values prior to calculating the observed quantiles; the simulated quantiles were estimated directly by pooling the non-zero amounts from all 100 simulations. The results shown are for a single site (B18) and for the whole area, both for the entire year and for the months of January and July.
Figures 10 and 11 show that the simulations do a good job of reproducing the overall distribution of wet day rainfall amounts (the points in the "whole year" plots fall very close to the line of perfect

agreement), but that there is a tendency to overestimate the most extreme rainfalls in January and underestimate in July. This phenomenon has been noted previously in GLM simulations (Yang et al., 2005; Leith, 2005) and is associated with excess variability in the summer months that is not accounted for by the constant coefficients of variation in the amounts models. The problem was highlighted earlier during the analysis of Pearson residuals from the fitted models.
It is interesting to note that the plots in Figures 10 and 11 are almost identical; the agreement between the simulated distributions from the monthly and daily atmospheric variable series is remarkable. In case the agreement seems suspicious, it may be worth pointing out that the sample size for the simulations is one hundred times as large as that for the observations -- thus the quantiles of the simulated distributions can be estimated quite accurately, even up to the level corresponding to the largest observation.
As a final check and comparison of the simulations, some extreme value analyses have been carried out. For each time series of interest, a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution was fitted to the 30 observed annual maxima (one for each year from 1961­1990); the 50th, 90th and 99th percentiles of these fitted distributions were then taken as estimates of the 2-, 10- and 100-year return levels that would be used in a conventional `event-based' approach to hydrological design based on these data. Next, the corresponding annual maxima were extracted from each of the GLM simulations to produce a combined sample of 3000 simulated maxima: the 5th, 90th and 99th percentiles of this combined sample were calculated as alternative estimates of return levels, without fitting a GEV.
Table 2 shows return level estimates from the GEV fits, as well as those from each set of GLM simulations. The 2- and 10-year GEV estimates are close to those reported in Yang et al. (2005); in some cases, however, the 100-year estimates are very different. For example, Yang et al. (2005) gave the 100-year GEV estimate for site B16 as 69.6mm compared with 175.6mm in Table 2; the highest 100-year GEV estimate in that paper was 96.8mm at site B15. The differences are caused by fitting to a subset of the original data: here, we are using data from 1961 to 1990 whereas Yang et al. (2005) used data from 1961 to 1999. The magnitude of some of these differences hints at substantial uncertainty in the return level estimates, and warns against overinterpreting any differences between the GEV and GLM results. A more formal way of assessing these differences is to compute confidence intervals for the GEV return levels based on profile likelihoods, as described by Coles (2001). Examples are shown in Figures 12 and 13, for B16 (the site with the largest 100year discrepancy) and the three-site average respectively. The GLM-based estimates are marked as dashed lines on these plots, and can be considered to agree with the GEV estimates if they fall within the limits defined by the lower horizontal lines. At B16 for example, the GLM-based 2-year estimate is slightly higher than the upper end of the confidence interval, although the difference is too small to be of practical concern; for both the 10- and 100-year levels, the GLM estimates fall within the confidence intervals.1 For the three-site average, all three GLM estimates fall comfortably within the confidence intervals.
Having established that the differences between GEV and GLM estimates in Table 2 are within
1For the 10-year level, the confidence interval is wider than the range used for plotting so that the lower horizontal line is off the bottom of the scale. For the 100-year period the GEV return level estimate itself is off the right hand end of the scale, although the lower horizontal line does appear on this plot

the range of uncertainty of the former, we consider the latter in more detail. The pattern across the sites is consistent for all of the different models, and is interpretable -- for example, the largest values are always at B15 which is the highest of the 10 gauges used for simulation, at an altitude of about 170m above sea level. It is also striking that the return level estimates almost all increase moving from left to right along each row: deseasonalising the atmospheric variables yields lower return level estimates, as does moving from a daily to a monthly time scale. It is perhaps not surprising that the `stationary' baseline models yield the lowest return level estimates of all, since systematic components of variability are missing from these models. Notwithstanding the differences along the rows, it is only for the 100-year return period that they become substantial, and even here they are relatively small relative to the range of uncertainty suggested by the GEV fits.

3.4 Summary of daily rainfall modelling
The conclusions from the work reported in this section are as follows:
· All of the fitted GLMs do a reasonable job of reproducing a variety of properties of the ob-
served rainfall sequences, over a range of spatial scales (represented by averages over different groups of sites).
· The properties of simulated sequences are affected by the temporal resolution and stan-
dardisation of the atmospheric variables; moreover, the effects are consistent with intuition (e.g. simulated extremes increase when moving from monthly to daily atmospheric variables). However, in absolute terms the effects are small.
· The use of daily, rather than monthly, atmospheric variables leads to more complex models.
In the next section, we consider GLM simulations conditioned on sequences of atmospheric variables produced by numerical climate models. As noted earlier, most climate models have 360day years, with 30 days in each month. The use of climate model output at a daily time scale is therefore problematic if simulations are to be associated with calendar dates. Elsewhere in FD2113, this problem has been avoided by using deseasonalised (with respect to the 1961­1990 period) monthly atmospheric variables. The results reported above suggest that any conclusions from the project will be unaffected by this strategy. From now on therefore, as elsewhere in the project, we only consider GLM simulations conditioned on Series A atmospheric variables.

4 Multi-site disaggregation
In this section we describe the methodology for disaggregating a daily multi-site rainfall sequence down to an hourly time scale, and use the technique in conjunction with the GLM simulations to simulate multi-site hourly rainfall sequences for both "control" and "future" periods over the Blackwater catchment. The control period is the 1961­1990 period used in the previous section, and the future period runs from 2070­2099.

4 MULTI-SITE DISAGGREGATION

4.1 Methodology
The disaggregation methodology is the same as that developed in DEFRA project FD2105, and is described more fully in Wheater et al. (2006); Segond et al. (2006). Hourly sequences are derived by combining the daily output from a GLM with the HYETOS single-site disaggregation model (Koutsoyiannis and Onof, 2000, 2001), which is based on Poisson cluster processes (Rodriguez-Iturbe and Eagleson, 1987). This single-site generator produces hourly totals that are consistent with the daily amounts at one of the sites of interest. The resulting sub-daily temporal pattern is then applied uniformly in space to obtain subdaily sequences of rainfall at multiple sites.
The main steps of the combined simulation and disaggregation procedure are as follows:

1. Simulate daily sequences of rainfall at a network of sites using a GLM.
2. Taking a cluster of wet days, defined as a series of consecutive wet days delimited by at least one dry day, use the single-site model to simulate hourly rainfall at one raingauge, defined as the master gauge, and disaggregate using an adjusting procedure, so that the hourly totals sum up to the daily totals.
3. Use the hourly pattern generated at the master gauge to disaggregate the daily information to hourly rainfall at the other gauges.
4. When the master gauge records zero rainfall, an arbitrary profile of hourly rainfall is required. Wheater et al. (2006) used the previous temporal profile at a site to carry on the methodology. However this can lead to the generation of unrealistically high values of hourly rainfall if, for instance, there was only one wet hour on the previous wet day so that the entire daily rainfall is allocated to a single hour. Therefore in this investigation, the previous profile is used provided no hourly rainfall depth greater than 30 mm is generated.

4.2 Application
The disaggregation methodology has been tested using simulated daily data from the Series A GLMs of Section 3, this time for all 34 sites in the Blackwater catchment. Three sets of simulations were carried out, as follows:
· 10 GLM simulations of the 1961-1990 period (control period), driven by NCEP historical at-
mospheric variables.
· 10 GLM simulations of the 1961-1990 period (control period), based on historical atmospheric
variables from the Hadley Centre Model, SRES A2 scenario, (HadCm3a2C).
· 10 GLM simulations of the 2070-2099 period (future period), based on future atmospheric
variables driven by the Hadley Centre Model, SRES A2 scenario, (HadCm3a2F).

4 MULTI-SITE DISAGGREGATION

20

All of the atmospheric variable sequences are normalised with respect to the mean and variance of the control period.
The single-site disaggregation procedure is undertaken with the HYETOS software (Koutsoyiannis and Onof, 2001) which requires the fitting of a 6-parameter Bartlett-Lewis model at one gauge. This master gauge was taken to be site B18, chosen for its central location. Since no hourly data are available within the Blackwater catchment, Bartlett-Lewis model parameter sets were derived from daily properties at Heathrow airport (see Section 2.2) using methodology developed in Work Package 2.1, separately for the NCEP, HadCm3a2C and HadCm3a2F scenarios. These parameter sets were derived using `Strategy 2' of Leith (2006, Section 4): daily summary statistics for each month and year are computed from the GLM simulations, scaling relationships are used to infer the corresponding hourly statistics, all of these statistics are averaged over years (but not over months) and used to derive, for each month of the year, a single set of Bartlett-Lewis model parameters corresponding to each 30-year atmospheric sequence. An alternative would have been to derive the parameters directly from the daily properties at the master gauge using the Work Package 2.1 methodology; this was not done here because the Heathrow parameter estimates were already available and because the results are likely to be relatively insensitive to the precise parameterisation used.
The aim of this study is to assess the extent of differences caused by the use of climate model outputs rather than NCEP data during the control period, and to compare the control and future periods in terms of hourly statistics and extremes. Note, however, that due to the lack of hourly data within the Blackwater catchment itself, it is not possible to evaluate the reproduction of hourly rain statistics directly. In broad terms however, the structure of the generated statistics in the control period should be similar to that at Heathrow, with appropriate adjustment for differences in location (and altitude effects in particular). Statistics for Heathrow are therefore included on all of the subsequent plots to aid interpretation.

4.3 Reproduction of standard statistics
We first compare statistics for hourly data derived from simulations driven by NCEP and HadCm3a2C predictors; and by HadCm3a2C and HadCm3a2F predictors. These statistics include the mean (M(h)); standard deviation (S(h)), temporal autocorrelations at lags 1­3 (A(1, 1), A(2, 1), A(3,1)), proportion of dry periods (PDRY(h)), and coefficient of skewness (SKW(h)). Table 3 presents the overall hourly statistics, averaged over 10 simulations of 30 years at the master gauge. It can be seen that simulations for the control period with NCEP and Hadley Centre predictors give on average similar statistics (less than 5% relative difference between the two series) whereas higher discrepancies are observed between the simulations for the control and future periods based on Hadley Centre predictors. In comparison to 1961­1990, on average the 2070­2099 period yields lower values for the mean hourly rainfall (-11.4%), standard deviation (-2.7%) and autocorrelations (-6 to -20%) but higher values for the skewness (+12.8 %) and proportion of dry periods (+1.3 %).
Tables 4 to 6 present similar statistics for various time-series obtained by averaging over groups of sites for 10 simulations of 30 years period. Results are consistent over sub-groups of 3, 10 and 34

sites and show similar trends as for the master gauge. This is to be expected since a single temporal profile of hourly rainfall is applied to disaggregate the daily rainfall at satellites sites. However the absolute values of the statistics vary over the sub-groups, reflecting the regional variability in rainfall over the catchment.
Having studied the overall summary statistics, we now examine their seasonal variation. Tables 7 to 9 show the hourly statistics averaged for each month over 10 simulations of 30 years. Again, this shows that the statistics are similar for both sets of control period simulations. For the future period, results for the winter months (Oct­April) are similar to those of the control period but lower values are recorded for the mean, standard deviation and autocorrelations for the summer months (May­ Sep). In contrast higher values of the skewness and the proportion of dry periods are observed for the period May­September.
To illustrate these trends, Figures 14, 15 and 16 display the envelope of simulated hourly summary statistics generated from 10 simulations at the master gauge driven respectively by NCEP, HadCm3a2C and HadCm3a2F predictors. The corresponding statistics from Heathrow are also shown. These figures illustrate the performance of the single-site disaggregation procedure. The control period properties are similar to those at Heathrow, with the exception of skewness which

seems to be underestimated in the summer months (this is probably due to the assumption of a constant shape parameter in the GLMs, which has already been noted as a potential problem). For the future period the reductions in mean rainfall and autocorrelations, and increases in proportion of dry periods and skewness, are clearly visible in Figure 16.
Figures 17, 18 and 19 present similar plots when applying the temporal profile of hourly rainfall from the master gauge to a typical site (B15) on the catchment; these plots therefore illustrate the effect of the multisite disaggregation methodology. B15 is at a higher altitude than B18 (170m compared with 80m), and hence the control period rainfall properties are different from those at Heathrow -- in particular, the mean and standard deviation are higher. However, the comparisons between control period simulations, and between control and future periods, tell essentially the same story as those for the master gauge.
The conclusion from these analyses is that similar values for the hourly properties are derived for the control periods (NCEP and Hadley Centre). This is to be expected since both sets of atmospheric predictors are normalised with respect to their control period means and standard deviations. Simulations for the future period are characterised by lower mean rainfall, higher proportion of dry periods and higher values of the skewness. This suggests that less rainfall is expected in the future with longer dry periods, but that wet periods are characterised by higher hourly extremes. This trend is accentuated during the summer months of May to September.

4.4 Analysis of Extremes
To complete this investigation, the extremal behaviour of the disaggregated rainfall is inspected since this is of primary importance in applications such as flood management. While carrying out this work, it was found that the extremal behaviour at a satellite gauge could be sensitive to the choice of temporal profile when the master gauge records zero rainfall. Recall that in such situations an artificial profile, which is essentially arbitrary, is used to disaggregate at the satellite gauge. In the original methodology, as developed in FD2105 (Wheater et al., 2006; Segond et al., 2006) and tested on a 12-year period at 20 sites on the Lee catchment, north of London, the same profile was used as for the previous wet day. However, in the current study the simulations are more extensive and the GLM simulations have some different properties:
· Longer dry periods are encountered (greater than a month) at the master gauge and at satel-
lite sites.
· Higher daily rainfalls (of the order of 100 mm) can be simulated at the satellite sites while zero
rainfall is generated at the master gauge.
The combination of these features means that when applying the previous day's profile at a satellite with high daily rainfall, unrealistically high hourly depths can be generated (for instance 100 mm daily total falling in 2 hours); the extremal performance suffers as a result. Therefore in the work reported below, it was decided to set a limit on the upper hourly rainfall depth that could be generated as a result of applying the previous day's profile. This limit was set to 30 mm. If this limit was reached, instead of using the previous profile, the total daily rainfall was divided by 24 i.e. a uniform hourly temporal profile was applied. The change makes very little difference to the standard summary statistics discussed already, but results in improved reproduction of extreme values.
To investigate extremal performance, the simulated annual hourly maxima for each 30-year period are considered. Tables 10, 11 and 12 present the range (minimum and maximum) and mean annual hourly rainfall maxima from 10 simulations of 30 years at 10 sites under the NCEP, HadCm3a2C and HadCm3a2F scenarios. On average, the annual hourly maxima are very similar for both sets of control period simulations. However, the mean annual hourly maxima are greater for the future Hadley Centre simulations than for the control period. In addition, for all three scenarios, sites B13 and B18 present similar characteristics while higher rainfall values are generated at the other sites. This is due to topographic effects in the GLMs.
The annual hourly maxima rainfall are displayed on a Gumbel plot using the Gringorten formulae to assign rank probabilities at 6 illustrative sites in Figures 20, 21 and 22, for simulations using NCEP, HadCm3a2C and HadCm3a2F predictors, respectively. The observed control period maxima from Heathrow are also plotted for reference purposes. The plots display values in agreement with those obtained for the Lee study (Wheater et al., 2006; Segond et al., 2006). Moreover, overall the control period simulations are in reasonable agreement with those at Heathrow except at higher elevation sites such as B15; the main discrepancy is that the simulations show slightly less curvature than the Heathrow data. The variability in the simulations seems slightly lower for HadCm3a2C than for either NCEP or HadCm3a2F, although the effect is not particularly large; more simulations would

4.5 Summary of disaggregation work
The methodology developed for DEFRA project FD2105 was used to disaggregate multisite daily rainfall sequences generated from GLMs in order to obtain hourly rainfall values incorporating scenarios of climate change. The methodology was tested on 30 simulations from GLMs with climate variables from NCEP and the Hadley Centre for the control period 1961-1990; and similarly with climate variables from the Hadley centre for the future period 2070-2099. Based on 10 realisations, results in terms of the reproduction of standard statistics and with respect to extreme values performance, show that simulations with NCEP and Hadley Centre predictors for the control period are effectively equivalent (as expected, given that all sequences are normalised with respect to the control period mean and variance). However, simulations with Hadley centre predictors for the future period suggest that less rainfall is expected, especially for the summer months (May­September), with longer proportion of dry periods and higher extreme values being generated. A comparison with hourly data from Heathrow shows that for the control period, the statistical properties of the simulations are realistic in the main; the only real discrepancy is a tendency to underestimate the skewness of summer rainfall distributions. This is related to the assumption of a constant shape parameter in the gamma GLM for daily rainfall amounts.
While carrying out this work, some improvements have been made to the disaggregation methodology from FD2105. Some of these were necessary to improve the performance of the methodology in a more challenging application; others involve modifications to the software so as to streamline the whole disaggregation process. The specific improvements carried out are as follows:
· The GLM simulations yielded longer periods of no rainfall (greater than a month) and greater
regional differences (some sites experiencing higher rainfall depth) than in the FD2105 application of the methodology. This caused problems with the use of an artificial profile when the master gauge recorded zero rainfall. One of the recommendations from FD2105 was to investigate further the use of the artificial profile. A first step has been trialled here, in which a limit of 30 mm on the hourly rainfall depth was imposed on days when the master gauge records zero rainfall. This appears to deliver reasonable performance with respect to extremes.
· The HYETOS software has been updated by D. Koutsoyiannis; the latest version makes it
much easier to automate the process of disaggregating an entire daily sequence. The gain in time is substantial: 10 disaggregations of 30 years can now be carried out in about an hour, whereas previously it took around a day.
· The multisite disaggregation software has been made much more efficient: given a set of
GLM simulations and single-site model parameters, 10 disaggregations of 30 years daily rainfall sequences can now be achieved in about a day. This offers the opportunity to carry out more extensive simulations in the future.

5 Summary of Work Package 3

The aim of this work package was to demonstrate how the nonstationary simulation capability developed elsewhere in FD2113 could be combined with the spatial-temporal disaggregation procedure from FD2105, to produce nonstationary multi-site sequences of subdaily rainfall incorporating scenario information from climate models. This objective has been met in full. The following additional issues have been addressed:
· The response of simulated rainfall sequences to both the time resolution and standardisation
of atmospheric inputs has been investigated. Overall, there is a tendency for finer-resolution atmospheric inputs to produce slightly larger rainfall extremes; however, on the basis of the available data it is not possible to distinguish between the various scenarios in terms of extremal performance. For a conservative analysis, fine-scale atmospheric inputs should be used; this has not been done here because of difficulties in reconciling 360-day climate model years with calendar dates. The existing GLM simulation software could be extended to accommodate this if necessary; this is a possible area for future work.
· A comparison has been carried out between control period simulations driven by NCEP and
Hadley Centre predictor variables. Since both sets of predictors are standardised with respect to control period means and variances, it is unsurprising that the basic statistical properties of the simulations are almost identical. However, differences between the NCEP and Hadley Centre predictors in terms of other properties (such as skewness) could conceivably lead to differences in the extremal properties of simulated sequences. The results reported here indicate that any such differences are too small to be of any practical significance. This is probably because the spatial and temporal resolution of the atmospheric predictors in our models is sufficiently coarse that their distributions are close to normal. An important consequence of this is that differences between historical rainfall properties (which are effectively those obtained by control period simulations driven by NCEP predictors) and those of future simulations can reasonably be ascribed to changes over time, rather than to intrinsic differences between simulations driven by observations and by climate models.
· Improvements have been made to the multi-site disaggregation software developed in FD2105,
to the extent where disaggregations can now be carried out much more quickly than before. This offers the potential for much more extensive testing of the methodology in the future.
We conclude by noting that the methodology illustrated here is not the only way to produce multisite nonstationary sequences using the tools developed in FD2105 and FD2113. An alternative would be as follows:
1. Simulate a nonstationary hourly series at a single site, using the methodology developed in Work Package 2.1.
2. Use a multi-site GLM to generate daily sequences at all the other sites, conditional upon the daily totals at the master gauge (this can be done easily using the GLIMCLIM software package).

3. Apply the hourly temporal profile from the master gauge to the daily simulations at all the other sites.
This approach was not adopted in the current work because experience shows that the GLMs are better able to reproduce realistic levels of interannual variability than the Poisson cluster-type models considered in Work Package 2.1 -- hence it seems better to start with a GLM simulation and to disaggregate it than to start with a simulation from a Poisson cluster model. Nonetheless, it would be of interest in future work to compare the results from the two approaches.
