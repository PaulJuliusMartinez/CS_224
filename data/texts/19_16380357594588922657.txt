On the Foundation of Combinatorial Theory. X. A Categorical Setting for: Symmetric Functions
By Flauio Bonetti,* Gian-Carlo Rota,t Domenico Senato,x and Antonietta M. Veneziax

A categorical setting is developed for the theory of symmetric functions.

1. Introduction
It has been said that every generation of mathematicians rewrites the theory of
symmetric functions to suit the problems of the day. This work may be viewed as an instance in point.
One of the classical-and perhaps one of the earliest-interpretations of
symmetric polynomials in severai variables (or symmetric functions, as they have
come to be improperly called) was given in terms of the combinatorial theory of
distribution and occupancy (sometimes known as "placing balls in boxes"). It has been known for a long time that some of the best-known symmetric
functions (for example, the elementary symmetric functions and the complete homogeneous symmetric functions) can be interpreted as generating functions for the number of subsets and of multisets of a finite set. To the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic deveiopment of this point of view is due to
Doubilet, who provides a combinatorial (or "bijective") interpretation of some of the fundamental identities holding among symmetric functions. Doubilet's paper is the starting point of the present work.
our objective wili be to develop the theory of symmetric functions aiong the iines of the theory of species initiated by André Joyal. More specificaily, in keeping with the classical view of symmetric functions as polynomiais of sorts,

we define a functor on the category of sets which may be rightfully viewed as a
categoricai analog of an ordinary polynomial, in finitely or infinitely many
variables. For these functors we propose the name "polynomial species." In fact, we provide a suitable extension of the notion of the generating function to polynomial species, and we verify that the coefficients of the generating function of a poiynomial species is indeed a polynomial (in general, a polynomial in infinitely many variables).

we believe the notion of polynomial species to be of independent interest in

the theory of enumeration. In the present work, it is systematically exploited to

achieve only one objective: the interpretation in categorical language of the

theory of symmetric functions. More specifically, our objective is to associate to

every identity holding among symmetric functions a categorical
"natural") identity among polynomial species. The classical identities

(and thus
are recov-

ered by taking generating functions. This objective is attained in the present

work for identities with nonnegative coefficients (requiring infinite sums and

possibly infinite products) hoiding among the ciassical symmetric functions, with

the notabie exception of identities involving the schur functions, which we hope

to treat in a subsequent paper.

our starting point was all but forced upon us by reflecting on what is to be

meant by a symmetric function. Previous authors have been content to consider

symmetric functions in a finite set of variables, or to soive the sometimes

delicate limiting problems that arise when the number of variables is infinite, by

linearly ordering the variabies as a sequenCe x1, x2,x3t.... These ad hoc and

sometimes misleading devices had to be replaced by a more subtle technique

that led to a definition of the notion of a sy.rnmetric function in any unordered

The next section gives the main result of this work, nameiy, the definition of a polynomiai species. This definition can be motivated as foilows. The ,,cate-

goricai" analog of a monomial is a function defined on a subset of a set E, with
values in a set of "variables" x. Thus, a "sum" of monomials has as its

categoricai counterpart the disjoint sum

[J Hom(,4,x) : HIE).

Foundation of Combinatorial Theory. X
Thus, .É1 is a functor from the category of finite sets (of which E is an object) to the category of sets.
Next, we consider the categoricai analog of a sum of monomials, each with a suitable coefficient (that is, the categorical analog of a poiynomiai). This is done
in two steps. First, one chooses a functor M from the category of finite sets and
bijections to the category of sets (generalizìng the notion of species in the sense of Joyal). The functor M will be the categoricai analog of the set from which the coefficients are chosen. Second, one must naturally choose for each finite set E a subset of the product

which will correspond to the assignment of "coefficients,, to each monomial. Fortunately, the categorical notion of subfunctor comes to our aid here. we define a polynomial species with coefficients in the functor M to be a subfunctor of the functor (1). Actually, the definìtion given in section 3 is slightly more
technical because of finiteness conditions (which are in turn a categorical
counterpart of the finiteness conditions that define formai polynomials).
To every polynomial species one assigns "generating poiynomials,,, which turn out to be formai poiynomials. In a "natural" sense, every homogeneous formal polynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients turns out to be the generating polynomial of a poiynomial species. In this sense, we may claim that
the notion of a poiynomial species is indeed the categorical counterpart of the notion of a poiynomial.
A symmetric polynomiai species is then defined as a polynomial species
which is invariant under all automorphisms of the set of "variables" x. In Section 4 we define infinite sums and products of families of poiynomial
species. Again, the motivation here is to give categorical definition of these operations among polynomial species that correspond-via generating polynomials-to infinite sums and products of formal polynomiais. we find it iurprising that this objective can be achieved within rhe category of finite sets.
The last operation we introduce is an assembiy of a polynomial species, in section 6. Here we closeiy follow Joyal's ideas and show that an assembiy of polynomial species does indeed correspond to the exponential of their generat-
ing polynomiais.
In Section 5 we introduce the species-theoretic equivalents of the classical
symmetric functions, to wit:

the elementary symmetric species A, namely, the functor such that for any finite set E, the set A{E] consists of all injective functions defined on E and with vaiues in X;

we follow another approach, which we believe to be close to the combina-

torics of symmetric functions, by introducing a suitable generalization of the

x (x,fr:xxnotion of polynomial to any set of variables, which we call formal polynomial.

Recall thata multiset m orL is a pair

--+ Z)where m is a function

such that fr(x)> 0 for any x  x.In other words, a multiset is a set x together

with a function fr which is to be interpreted as the multiplicity of every element

of X.

The support of a multiset m on X is the set

supp(rn) : {r = X:mQ) > 0\ .

A ftnite multiset is a multiset whose support is a finite (possibly empty) set"
We shall denote by "/ the set of finite multisets on X, and by m, the
multiset whose support is empty. The cardinaliry of a finite multiset m is the foilowing integer:

lml : I *Q). x e supp(m)

The sum mt+ m) and product ffilffiz of multisets are defined as foilows: mr+ m2: (X,m1+mz:X -Z),
where
(mr+ mr)(r) : mr(*) - *z(ò,

and where

ffir' ffi2 : (X,fr,..fr2: X - Z),
(m,' nr)( x) : mrQ) . mr(*).

The sum and product of several multisets are defined similarly.

3. Polynomial species
The central notion of the present work is that of polynomial species. We shall see that this notion is the set-theoretic counterpart of the notion of a formal poiynomial. In fact, the ordinary algebraic operations of sum and product of formal poiynomials (both finite and infinite) turn out to have fitting set-theoretic counterparts for polynomial species.

we define the sum and product of polynomiai species, as well as a notion of convergence. By passing to generating functions, these notions are seen to be the set-theoretic counterparts of the corresponding notions for formal polyno-

When P is the limit of the family (P,') =.i we write

PRoposrrtorl 4.2. lím, Gen(P;, z): Gen(iim iPi, z).

eo(gen(rr,n)) : sen(eo(P;),n) : gen(e.(P),r) : ep(sen(P,n)).

Proof: Suppose that the family (&),=, is summable. From Proposition 4.3 it
foilows that the set

5. Some special polynomial species
Example 5.1; We define the polynomial species A,, for eyery x X, as
follows:

a,IE]' :

(u-xHom(E'{x})
\a

if if

lrl: t'
lcl+ r.

The generating function of the polynomial species A* is cleariy
Gen(A,,2) : xz.

Example 5.2: (The elementary symmetric species); This polynomial species, denoted by A, is defined as follows:

^lal: {(o,f.)},
A[E] : {(8, f) : f : E -,X is an injective function}.

One verifies that

gen(AfEl) : lele e1(x),

where e,(X) is the elementary symmetric function defined by
e,(x): l*^,
:where the sum ranges over ail muitisets z such that lml: n lsupp(m)l (that is,
over ail multisets that "are" sets). The generating function of the elementary s).rnmetric species is

Gen(A,z) :

Example J"3; The species H, is defined, for every x e X, as follows:
H,lAl:A,
andif E+A,
H,IE]: {(r,/)} where f : E --+ X is the function taking the constant value x, and a is a

permutation of the set E. One verifies that
gen((1 +H,)[E]) : lEl!1rEr,
and hence that

where:
(1) k is a composition of E indexed on F such that lk(:r)l --m(x) for every
,-ret E. t
(2) r is a famiiy {o,},.r of permutations, where a, is a permutation of the
set k(x).
We claim that the sets Im;E]and llm;Ell are naturally bijective. To see this, it
/suffices to realize that every function from E to F defines a composition k by
setting
k(*) : /-'(r).
Conversely, given a composition k, we obtain a function f :E--.F by setting
/(s) :'
whenever s e k(x)" Now, the cardinality of the set [[nz; E]l is
IF lr
r#Gf,l=l.t(x)l: lEl!'

since lEl!/JJ ,. rfrlx)t is the number of compositions È of the set E such that
It(r)l: *(r).

Let us now continue to define new poiynomial species. Example 5.5: The symmeîric species H of disposirions is defined as follows:

andif E+Q

H.lal: f@,f.)\ H[E] : {(d.,f)\,

where f : E -, X is an arbitrary function, and for each fiber f-t(x), a permutation is defined on /-1(x). The set of such permutations is denoted by d.
The generating function of the poiynomial species of dispositions is

:Gen(H, z) L nth,@)fi : L h,(x)zn, n>0 n>0

where h"(X) is the complete homogeneous symmetric function of degree n,
that is,
h^(x) : L^r^,

where the sum ranges over ali multisets m such that lnl : n" In fact, the
preceding theorem gives

gen(HfEl) : lElth,r( x).

Example 5"ó; The cyclic polynomial species C is defined as

clql:Ò

andif E+ó

:c[E] {(v, f )} ,

where f : E -- X is a function such that

f (e) : f (r') for ail e,e' e E,

and 7: E -+ E is a cyciic permutation.
One verifies that

Note that P@lAl: A- We set P(0): 1. We have now

Gen(P(h), ,1 :

Gen(\r(.")'t)
.

( 6.1)

It is easy to prove the identity (6.1) by the foilowing remark. Let k and k'be
strict compositions of E indexed on ,[ and 1' respectively. Say that the
compositions È and k' are equivalent when there exists a bijection
$:l -+ I'
such that k'o ó= k. An equivalence class of strict compositions determines a partition of E, and converseiY.
From (6.1) and from the product identity for generating functions we have
Gen(P', z) : Gen(P, z)e

and hence

4 :Gen(P(h),

GenLP''')h
.

The family {P&):h>0} is summable, since for any finite set E, the sets P(r')[E]

are almost all equal to the empty set.
We can therefore define the exponentíal species Exp(p) of the polynomiai
species P as the sum of the family (P(h)), that is,
ExP(P) : f, rtr'r' h>0

Note that Exp(P)tEl: Uo,oP(')[E]. Clearly
Gen(Exp(P) ,z): I g#ffxÀ h>0

7. Some identities on symmetric species

product identity for eiementary symmetric functions:

Proof: Let a be an element of Exp(CXEl. Thus, a contains the following
data:
(1) a partition Ír of E,
(2) for each B ert, a pair (76,/s), where fs:B--+ X is a function taking a
constant value, and where 7u is a cyclic permutation of the set B. Now, for every .r  X, set
B(r) : U {4,/r(B):'}.
The set of sets
{r(r):xeX,B(x)+A\
is a partition of E. The set of cyclic permutations
{yurBr,BeB(x))
defines a permutation of the set B(x), which we denote by o(x).
We define a function f : E --X by setting
fl' : fa.
Then /la<,1 takes the constant value x, and the pair
(io('): B(x) + a),f )
is a disposition and thus an element of H[E].
Conversely, let (d,/) e HtEl be a disposirion. Let
o : {f-'(x):f-t(l+a}.
Thus n is a partition of E. On every block B eîr a permutation cr(B) is defined. Let ilB) be the partition of B such that for every B,e r(B) the
restriction a(B') of. o(B) to B' is a cyclic permutation.
