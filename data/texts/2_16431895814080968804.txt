Abstract. A collective model of nuclear quadrupole-octupole vibrations and rotations, originally restricted to a coherent interplay between quadrupole and octupole modes, is now developed for application beyond this restriction. The eigenvalue problem is solved by diagonalizing the unrestricted Hamiltonian in the basis of the analytic solution obtained in the case of the coherent-mode assumption. Within this scheme the yrast alternating-parity band is constructed by the lowest eigenvalues having the appropriate parity at given angular momentum. Additionally we include the calculation of transition probabilities which are fitted with the energies simultaneously. As a result we obtain a unique set of parameters. The obtained model parameters unambiguously determine the shape of the quadrupole-octupole potential. From the resulting wave functions quadrupole deformation expectation values are calculated which are found to be in agreement with experimental values.
1 Introduction
Collective quadrupole and octupole deformations in atomic nuclei, providing vibrational, rotational and transitional structures of the spectra, lead to especially interesting spectra with parity effects in the regions where these deformations coexist. In [1] Minkov et al. applied a coherent quadrupole-octupole motion (CQOM) model to several even-even rare-earth nuclei. This model can be solved analytically if one imposes equal frequencies for the quadrupole and octupole motion and the solution is shortly presented below.
The purpose of the present work, in continuation of a previous paper [2], is to include transition probabilities into the model description. This allows for the first time a unique determination of the model parameters which are adjusted so as to reproduce the experimental values in the best way possible. As a consequence, the model potentials and the resulting wave functions are now obtained unambiguously and even allow a prediction of the quadrupole deformation by calculating the 2 expectation value.

for the "angular" wave functions with either positive or negative parity. For the quantum numbers n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and k = 1, 2, 3, . . . one chooses
the lowest possible values to describe the yrast spectra. This means one takes always n = 0 and k = 1 for even angular momenta (positive parity) and k = 2 for odd angular momenta (negative parity). In the case when non-yrast alternatingparity bands are described one needs to consider higher k-values [10].

2.3 Numerical diagonalization
The details about the diagonalization procedure can be found in [2]. The CQOM basis functions (, ) have the advantage to automatically consider the boundary condition of the model, namely that the wave function must vanish along the 3-axis. An energy cutoff for the number of basis functions is applied and we consider approximately the 30 lowest lying states for the diagonalization. It is checked that this is enough to provide convergence of the results, i.e. the results do no longer change if more basis states are added. Furthermore the basis is optimized as explained in [2]. For the integration of the matrix elements we apply a formula which allows one to obtain the numerical values of the definite integrals quickly by means of a generalized hypergeometric function 3F2. Then the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian matrix are calculated and we construct the model spectrum as described in [2].

2.4 Theory of transition operators
The basic theory about electromagnetic transitions in the coherent case can be found in [1]. Since the consideration is restricted to axial deformations only, the projection K of the collective angular momentum on the principal symmetry axis is taken as zero.
For a given model state nkIM0(, ), a given multipolarity  as well as initial quantum numbers n = ni, k = ki, I = Ii, and final quantum numbers n = nf , k = kf , I = If , we have

B(E; nikiIi  nf kf If )

1 =
2Ii + 1 MiMf 

nff kf If Mf 0(, )|M(E)|niikiIiMi0(, )

(9)

The operators for the electric E1, E2 and E3 transitions are given by

M(E) =

2 + 1 4(4 - 3,1)

Q^ 0

D0,

 = 1, 2, 3,

(10)

where

Q^10 = M123

Q^0 = M,

 = 2, 3 .

(11)

49

M. Strecker, N. Minkov, H. Lenske

For the Q^-operators we use first order expressions in 2 and 3 for the E2 and E3 case while for E1 we use the second order expression.
The M factors are electric charge factors which we take as [4]

M =

3 (2 +

1)

Z

eR0,

 = 2, 3 ,

(12)

where R0 = r0A1/3 with r0  1.2 fm is the nuclear radius, Z is the proton number and e is the electric charge of the proton. The charge factor M1 is taken according to the droplet model concept [5­7] in the form [9]

(13)

where the quantities J and Q are related to the volume and surface symmetry energy, respectively. A reasonable choice for them should lie in the regions [8,9]

25  J  44 MeV 17  Q  70 MeV .

(14)

For practical calculations we choose fixed average values J = 35 MeV and Q = 45 MeV. We also replace the proton charge e by an effective charge ee1ff, which can have a value different from one and which enters in the fitting procedure as
an adjustable parameter.
It was found however that the operators from equation (11) are not sufficient
for the CQOM model and have to be modified as follows. In continuation to the above mentioned transition theory, we can write the Q^-operators, Eq. (11), in
ellipsoidal coordinates as

Q^10 = M1pq2 cos  sin  Q^20 = M2p cos  Q^30 = M3q sin  .

(15) (16) (17)

The operators (15)-(17) correspond to a fixed nuclear shape situation with fixed values of 2 and 3. In case of the CQOM the density distribution can have many maxima. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a kind of "overtones" related to the coherent collective oscillations of the system. The original operators (15)(17) cannot take into account multiple maxima in the collective states. As a consequence it was found that using these original operators the B(E3) transition probabilities are vanishing if the difference in the k numbers of the two used wave functions is larger than one.
As explained in [10], this limitation is removed by the introduction of the following replacements:


cos  - A20()  a2(k0) cos(k)
k=1 
sin  - A30()  a(3k0) sin(k) .
k=1

(18) (19)

If one choses a(k) = 1/k then the sums are convergent and the limit is known in analytical form.

where the floor function cuts away the digits after the comma and gives the largest previous integer. The angular part of the second order operator can then be generalized by replacing the factors of the product with their generalizations


cos  sin  - A10()  A20()A30() =

 cos(m) sin(n) .

(22)

m=1 n=1

If one reduces the sums to only the first summand, the original operators are reobtained. We now redefine the transition operators (15)-(17) as

Q^10(, ) = M1pq2A10() Q^20(, ) = M2pA20() Q^30(, ) = M3qA30() .

(23) (24) (25)

If one carries out the integration over the rotational part involving the Wigner D-functions, one is left with

B(E; nikiIi  nf kf If ) =

Ii00|If 0

2R2 (nikiIi

 nf kf If )

(26)

where the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient appears and R involves integrals of  and  and is given by

R(nikiIi  nf kf If ) = nff kf If (, )|Q^0|niikiIi (, ) .

(27)

We can advantageously use this coherent theory from [10] to calculate the transition probabilities in the non-coherent case. Since the wave function is expanded with respect to the basis functions and for them the transition theory is known, we obtain for the non-coherent matrix elements the following double sum including known expansion coefficients:

R~(Ii  If ) =

cnIf k cIni k R(n k Ii  n k If ) .

nk n k

(28)

In order to calculate the non-coherent transitions one simply has to replace R with R~ in the above expression (26).

We take into account transition probabilities related to the yrast band. It has been found that this is very important and necessary in order to obtain a set of parameters which is uniquely determined. The reason for this is that one of the fitting parameters, c, only appears in the wave functions. Its value could be arbitrarily chosen in the previous approach without transition probabilities and was chosen in such a way as to approximately reproduce parameter values which lie in a physically reasonable region.

3 Application to Some Nuclei

Once the diagonalizations have been performed for all angular momenta, one obtains an yrast spectrum and is able to define a function RMS which gives the root mean square deviation from the experimental levels. The transition probabilities are calculated from the above theory and we construct an overall root mean square deviation function including both energies and transitions. The transitions are included with weight factors providing the same order of magnitude for the fitting procedure.
Then the model parameters B2, B3, C2, C3, d2, d3, d0 and ee1ff can be adjusted so as to provide the best description of experimental data. As a first guess for the minimization we take the parameter values obtained from the CQOM model.
The model approach was applied to describe the yrast alternating parity spectra and yrast transitions of the nuclei 152,154Sm, 154,156Gd, 100Mo and 236U. The resulting optimal parameters are given in Table 1. It should be kept in mind that the fitting algorithm finds a local minimum and it eventually could be that there is another minimum which provides an even better description. We also calculate the corresponding wave functions for zero angular momentum and the resulting quadrupole deformation expectation values given by

We expect that in this previous approach where only energies were used for the fitting procedure one obtains a better root mean square (RMS) value for the energies than in the present work. This is due to the fact that here we also simultaneously fit transition probabilities in addition to the energies. For two nuclei this is checked in Table 3. While we see our expectation confirmed in the case of 152Sm, we surprisingly notice that in case of 154Gd the RMS value for the energies is even better than the value of 54

the previous approach. This is an indication that the parameters of the previous approach are not optimal and a better parameter set is found in the present work.
In order to get an idea about the quality of the fitted transitions Table 4 provides some data from the experiment as well as theoretical values. As one can see, the agreement is quite good and most often in agreement with the error bars.
One main result is that with the inclusion of transition probabilities into the fitting procedure we obtain unique parameters which additionally lie in a physically reasonable region.
Another impressive result which can be seen from Table 2 is that ­ without fitting these quantities ­ the quadrupole deformation expectation values are obtained reasonably and they reproduce the behaviour given by the experiment for the different nuclei, especially the least deformed nucleus in the experiment is also least deformed in the theory and the same holds for the most deformed nucleus. The octupole deformation (not shown here) can be obtained in a similar way by localizing the maximum of the wave function in the quadrant with both positive 2 and 3 for angular momentum I = 1.
Also the shapes from the wave functions seem to change according to the region of nuclei. We observe that the wave functions for the rare-earth nuclei 152,154Sm and 154,156Gd look quite similar while the one for 100Mo looks very different. The shape of the wave function for 236U is similar to the rare-earth case but still different since it looks more heart-shaped.
Concerning future improvements, one could look not only for yrast states but also for higher lying states for which experimental data also exists. However, first test calculations have shown that the overall description of the levels in terms of the RMS deviation becomes much worse in this case. This is due to
56

the fact that we do not have good quantum numbers n and k in the non-coherent case and therefore cannot reproduce the "jumping" over quantum numbers as it is done in the analytic coherent case [10].
Secondly, one could extend the formalism also to odd-A nuclei. Preliminary work in this direction has already been done. Acknowledgements This work is supported by DFG and HIC for FAIR. References [1] N. Minkov, P. Yotov, S. Drenska, W. Scheid, D. Bonatsos, D. Lenis and D. Petrellis,
