ABSTRACT 
 
The  paper  deals  with  the  tools  for  the  acoustic  design  of  auditoria,  and  the  development  of 
these  tools  during  the  last  century.  Ripple  tanks  could  model  the  wave  nature  of  sound  in  a 
reflecting  enclosure,  but  only  in  two  dimensions.  Scale  models  using  high  frequency  sound 
waves  have  been  used  for  testing  the  design  of  new  auditoria  since  the  1930es.  The 
development  of  the  room  acoustic  parameters  flourished  along  with  the  development  of  scale 
model  technique.  But  also  the  possibility  to  listen  to  the  sound  in  the  model  was  a  challenge 
since  the  early  days.  The  first  computer  models  for  room  acoustic  design  appeared  around 
1967  and  during  the1990es  they  have  matured.  The  results  became  more  and  more  reliable, 
the  calculation  speed  increased  significantly,  and  new  methods  for  acoustic  analysis  of  the 
auditorium  were  developed,  one  of  them  being  the  possibility  of  producing  high  quality 
auralization.  
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The development of the design tools is described in three sections considering physical models, 
scale models, and computer models. First is mentioned the early attempts by Sabine and others 
to  use  various  physical  models,  primarily  to  analyse  the  first  reflections  in  a  two  dimensional 
section  of  a  room.  Either  wave  fronts  or  rays  could  be  modelled.  With  microphones  it  became 
possible  to  take  recordings  of  sound  in  scale  models,  and  from  the  beginning  the  purpose  was 
to  perform  listening  tests,  i.e.  what  today  is  called  ‘auralization’.  The  development  of  the  scale 
modelling  technique  from  the  1930es  to  the  1970es  was  mainly  to  reduce  the  scale  from 
originally  1:5  to  1:50,  and  thus  making  the  technique  a  more  efficient  tool  for  the  design 
purpose.  The  development  of  computer  models  has  been  in  the  direction  of  combined  hybrid 
models  with  emphasis  on  calculation  speed  and  more  reliable  results.  For  the  developers  of 
room acoustic computer models it has been very important that a number  of international Round 
Robin  comparisons  have  been  organised.  From  those  it  has  been  clear  that  the  modelling  of 
scattering  effects  is  crucial  for  obtaining  reliable  results.  Thus  it  may  be  of  great  importance  for 
the future development that ISO is now preparing methods for treatment of scattering.  
 
This  presentation  will  focus  on  the  historical  development  with  emphasis  on  the  old  and  partly 
forgotten  techniques,  whereas  the  newest  development  in  computer  models  can  easily  be  found 
elsewhere.

PHYSICAL MODELS 
 
Ultrasonic  –  Schlieren  Photography.  In  1913  Sabine  published  a  paper  describing  the  use  of 
ultrasonic  waves  and  Schlieren  photography  to  study  wave  front  reflections  from  the  ceiling  and 
walls  in  2D  sections  of  a  scale  model  [1].  The  sound  source  is an electric spark made by the 
discharge  of  a  condenser.  With  smoke-filled  air  and  strong  light  from  behind,  the  wave  fronts 
are  made  visible  and  can  be  registered  on  a  photographic  plate.  The  light  is  refracted  because 
the  wave  front  is  much  denser  than  the  surrounding  air.  The  method  can  visualize  effects  of 
diffraction and scattering from irregularities. 
 

 
Ripple  Tank.  Very  similar  pictures  can  be  made  by  sending  light  through  a  water  tank  with 
shallow  water  waves  that  are  created  by  a  mechanic  vibrator  [3].  A  continuous  source  will 
create  a  train  of  waves  and  the  wavelength  can  be  chosen  to  represent  that  of  a  typical 
frequency of sound. In a 1:50 scale model the water depth should be approximately 10 mm.  
 
Optical  –  Light  Beam  Method. A light source has been used to replace the sound source. One 
method published in 1929 uses a light source  inside a cylinder with a lot of slits. In a 2D model 
with  light  reflective  surfaces  it  is  possible  to  get  a  picture  of  light  beams  and  their  first  order 
reflections. Surfaces that should be absorbing can be painted black to avoid the reflection.

reflections  in  a  sectional  model  of  Okuma 
Memorial  Auditorium.  (Satow,  1929  –  from 
Knudsen  [4]). 
 
 
Optical  –  Light  Distribution  Method.    In  the  1930es  an  optical  method  was  used  to  investigate 
the  energy  distribution  in  an  auditorium.  An  opal  glass  plate  is  used  to  represent  the  audience. 
The  other  surfaces  of  the  room  are  modelled  of  sheet  aluminium  with  an  optical  reflection 
coefficient  of  about  50%.  With  a  light  source  representing  the  sound  source,  the  brightness  of 
the  opal  glass  indicates  the  steady-state  sound  pressure  distribution  over  the  seating  area. 
Vermeulen & de Boer [5] used this method for the design of the Philips Theater in Eindhoven. 
 
Optical  –  Laser  Beam  Method.  In  more  recent  time  the  laser  beam  has  been  used  by  Nagata 
Acoustics to investigate first order reflections in a 3D model of Suntory Hall (1986).

ACOUSTIC SCALE MODELS 
 
Technicolor  Models.  In  1934  Spandöck  [6]  made  the  first  report  on  a  method  for  subjective 
assessment  of  the  acoustics  of  a  room  by  use  of  three-dimensional models. The scale was 1:5 
and  he  used  a  wax  drum  at  60  rev/min  to  record  a  sound  signal, which was played back at 300 
rev/min  and  radiated  into  the  model.  Sound  in  the  model  was  recorded  at  the  high  speed  and 
played back at the low speed. In the following years Jordan [7] improved the method by using a 
magnetic  recorder  (the  Poulsen  Telegraphone)  with  20  sec  samples  of  speech.  This  could 
demonstrate the influence of sound absorption in the room on the speech intelligibility.

Major Hall for the Sydney Opera House (not 
the  final  design,  but  the  last  Utzon  design 
around 1966). ([11] fig. 4.10). 

The  principle  in  scale  modelling  is  that  all  physical  dimensions  including  the  wavelengths are 
reduced  by  the  scale  factor.  The  name  ‘Technicolor  Models’  as  well  as  the  other  names  used 
here  for  scale  models  was  originally  proposed  by  Burd  [8].  The  reason  for  this  name  is  the 
attempt  to  choose  surface  materials  with  the  correct  absorption  coefficients  at  the  scaled 
frequencies.  In  the  further  development  by  Reichardt  [9]  and  others  the  scale  was  reduced  to 
1:10 or 1:20. In order to minimize the influence of the air attenuation at high frequencies, the air 
in  the  model  was  dried  to  around  2%  RH.  Dummy  heads  in  the  chosen  scale  were  developed 
for  the  recording  of  binaural  signals  from  the  models.  The  example  in  Fig.  4  was  used  for  the 
redesign of the Semper Opera in Dresden. 
 
Half-Tone  Models.  When  the  scale  model  technique  is  used  for  the  design of a hall, it may be 
too  time  consuming  and  impractical  to  use  listening  tests  to  assess  the  acoustical  quality. 
Objective  room  acoustical  measurements  are  faster  and  more  precise.  Such  measurements  are 
based  on  the  impulse  response,  which  can  easily  be  measured  with  an  electric  spark  as 
impulse  sound  source.  During  the  1950es  and  -60es  this  technique  was  taken  into  use  for 
design  of  opera  theatres  and  concert  halls,  and  in  the  same  period  the  development  of  new 
objective  room  acoustic  parameters  flourished  [11].  These  models  are  called  ‘Half-Tone Models’ 
because  there  is  no  attempt  to  model  the  absorption  of  the  surfaces  with  high  precision.  Only 
the  audience  is  modelled  with  approximately  to  correct  absorption  [12].  Other  surfaces  are 
made  as  reflective  as  possible,  and  the  air  attenuation  is  taken  as  it  is  without  drying  the  air. 
Before  the  model  is  taken  into  use  the  reverberation  time  as  a  function  of  the  frequency  is 
adjusted  approximately  by  adding  patches  of  sound  absorbing  material  in  the  ceiling or on other 
suitable  surfaces.  With  a  small-scale  dummy  head  it  is  possible  to  include  an  approximate 
auralization  by  convolution  of  a  test  sound  with  the  measured  Binaural  Room  Impulse 
Response (BRIR). 
 
Black  &  White  Models.  In  order  to  shorten  the  time  needed  for  model  tests,  the  modelling 
technique  was  further  developed  in  the  late  1970es  for  very  small  models  in  the  scale  of  1:50 
[13]. In this scale it is very difficult to control the absorption of the materials, and if the surfaces 
are either reflective or absorptive this may be characterized as ‘Black & White Models’.

COMPUTER MODELS 
 
Wave  Equation  Models.  Such models like the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Boundary 
Element  Method  (BEM)  are  characterized  by  creating  very  accurate  results  at  single 
frequencies. However, since the number of modal frequencies in a room increases with the third 
power  of  the  frequency,  wave  models  are  typically  restricted  to  low  frequencies  and  small 
rooms. 
 
Image  Source  Model.  This  method  is  based  on  the  principle  that  a  specular  reflection  can  be 
constructed  geometrically  by  mirroring  the  source  in  the  plane  of  the  reflecting  surface.  In  a 
rectangular  box-shaped  room  it  is  very  simple  to  construct  all  image  sources  up  to  a  certain 
order  of  reflection  [14-15].  But  in  an  arbitrary  room  the  number  of  possible  image  sources 
increases  exponentially  with  the  order  of  reflection,  and  thus  the  method  is  not  suitable  for 
rooms  like  concert  halls  where  reflection  orders  of  several  hundred  are  relevant  for  the  audible 
reverberant decay.  
 
Markoff  Chain  Model.  The  decaying  sound  in  a  room  can  be  considered  as  a  process  of  sound 
absorption in discrete steps of a time interval that corresponds to the mean free path in a three-
dimensional  sound  field,  dt  =  4V/cS,  where  V is the volume,  c is the speed of sound, and  S is 
the  total  surface  area  in  the  room.  This  model  is  based  on  a  probability  function  for  sound 
travelling from one surface to any other surface in the room. Thus a room averaged decay curve 
is  calculated  and  the  location  of  absorption  material  on  the  different  surfaces  is  taken  into 
account [16]. 
 
Particle Tracing Models. A more realistic way to simulate the decaying sound is to trace a large 
number  of  particles  emitted  in  all  directions  from  a  source  point.  Each particle carries a certain 
amount  of  sound  energy  that  is  reduced  after  each  reflection  according  to  the  absorption 
coefficient  of  the  surface  involved.  As  shown  in  Fig.  6  the  result  is  the  average  decay  curve  for 
the room from which the reverberation time is evaluated [17]. 
 

 

 
Fig. 6. Particle tracing based on geometrical acoustics. Left: The sound energy follows the path 
of  several  hundred  rays  (only  one  is  shown),  and  the  energy  of  the  particles  is  reduced  when 
they hit an absorbing surface. Right: Average decay curve. (After Schroeder [17]). 
 
 
Ray  Tracing  Models.  The  first  computer  model  that  was  used  for  practical  design  of  auditoria 
was a ray tracing model [18]. A large number of sound rays are traced from a source point up to 
high  order  reflections  following  the  geometrical/optical  law  of  reflection.  The  main  result  of  this 
early  model  is  the  distribution  of  ray  hits  on  the  audience  surface,  analysed  in  appropriate 
intervals  of  the  time  delay.  So,  this  is  a  qualitative  presentation  of  the  sound  distribution in 
space  and  time.  For  a  closer  analysis  the  direction  of  incidence  of  each  ray  can  also  be 
indicated.  In  order  to  obtain  quantitative  results  it  is  necessary  to  introduce  receiver  surfaces  or 
volumes  for  detection  of  the  sound  rays.  So,  an  approximate  energy-reflectogram  can  be 
calculated and used for an estimate of some room acoustic parameters [19-20].

Cone  Tracing  Models.  An  alternative  to  the  receiver  volume  used  in  ray  tracing  models  is  a 
point  receiver  in  combination  with  cones  that  have  a  certain  opening  angle  around  the  rays. 
Cones  with  circular  cross  section  have  the  problem  of  overlap  between  neighbour  cones  [21]. 
Cones with a triangular cross section can solve this problem [22], but still it is difficult to obtain 
reliable results with this method.

source  S  to  the  receiver  M.  The  first  and 
second  order  image  sources  are  also  shown.

Radiosity  Models.  The  principle  is  that  the  reflected  sound  from  a  surface  is  represented  by  a 
large  number  of  source  points  covering  the  surface  and  radiating  according  to  some  directivity 
pattern, typically a random distribution of directions [22]. This method has also been used as an 
efficient way to model the scattered part of the early reflected sound [30]. 
 
Hybrid  Models.  The  disadvantages  of  the  classical  methods  have  lead  to  development  of  hybrid 
models,  which  combine  the  best  features  of  two  or  more  methods  [22–30].  Thus  modern 
computer models can create reliable results with only modest calculation times. The inclusion of 
scattering  effects  and  angle  dependent  reflection  with  phase  shifts  has  made  it  possible to 
calculate impulse responses with a high degree of realism. This in turn has been combined with 
Head  Related  Transfer  Functions  (HRTF)  to  give  Binaural  Room  Impulse  Responses  (BRIR), 
which are convolved with anechoic sound recordings to make auralization of high quality.

CONCLUSION 
 
During  the  last  century  a  rich  variety  of  ideas  and  methods  have  been  created  in  order  to  bring 
the  acoustic  design  of  auditoria  from  a  weakly  understood  art  to  a  scientifically  based  field  of 
engineering. With the latest development in computer modelling it has been possible to combine 
the  best  features  of  the  older  methods,  to  get  reliable  predictions  of  objective  acoustic 
parameters, and in addition to offer auralization for subjective listening tests.
