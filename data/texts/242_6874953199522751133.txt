By Hans H. Euler, Albert0 M. Marmont, Andrea Bacigalupo, Sven Fastenrath, Peter Dreger, Matthias Hoffknecht, Axel R. Zander, Berthold Schalke, Uwe Hahn, Rainer Haas, and Norbert Schmitz

Autologous stem cell transplantation with or without in vitro lymphocyte depletion has been suggested as a new treatment option for severe autoimmune diseases. We describe five patients with autoimmune diseases (CREST syndrome, myasthenia gravis and Hashimoto`s thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis) who underwent autologous bone marrow
(n = 1)or peripheralbloodprogenitorcell (n = 4)transplanta-
tion with unmanipulatedgrafts as treatment for the autoim-

mune disease in one case or as treatment for a malignant disorder with a concomitant autoimmune disorder in four cases. In all patients serological and clinical signs of the autoimmune disease recurredearly or persisted.These observations should be regardedas a cautionarynote concerning the efficacy of high-dose therapy followed by transplantation of unmanipulated autologous stem cells for treatment of severe autoimmune diseases. 0 1996 by The American Society of Hematology.

HIGH-DOSE chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) has been proposed as a new approach to treat severe autoimmune diseases,'-6and corresponding guidelines have been published.'
To date, auto-SCT in autoimmune diseases has been a largely hypothetical option supported by theoretical considerations and a few animal studies, as reviewed else-
here?.^.^.^ It is assumed that a vigorous immunoablative
preparative regimen can delete the patient's immune system, including autoaggressive lymphocyte clones. Hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis are reconstituted by subsequent autoSCT. Therapeutic benefit may result from the intensified immunosuppressive regimen alone. Additionally, it seems possible that a newly developing immune system might acquire tolerance towards previous autoantigens even when derived from autologous SCT.2-4
It is not clear whether auto-SCT for autoimmune diseases should be performed by using bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells: which type of immunoablation should be used, or whether depletion of immunologically competent lymphocytes in the graft should be attem~ted.~
Observations of the course of disease after auto-SCT in autoimmune disease patients or in patients with malignant diseases and concomitant autoimmune diseases can help to answer these questions.
We describe five patients suffering from autoimmune diseases alone or from malignancies with concomittant autoimmune diseases, who underwent high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent auto-SCT with unmanipulated grafts. The autoimmune disease recurred or persisted in all cases.

One patient (no. 1) underwent autologous BMT. Four patients (no. 2 through 5) underwent autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation (PBPCT). The preparative regimen consisted in high-dose chemotherapy alone in four patients (no. 1 through 3, and 5), and in combined radiotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy in one patient (no. 4) (Table 1). In all cases, the graft was cryopreserved, and in all cases the graft was not manipulated.
Case Reports
Case 1. The 41-year-old female nurse had suffered from an incomplete CREST syndrome with Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasis (without calcinosis), and with high-titer anticentromer antibodies up to 1:1,280 and severe arthralgias since 1990. Disease activity remained severe despite treatment with methylprednisolone (8 to 16 mg/d), cyclosporine A (5 mg/ kg BW), and two courses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (each 1,600 mg). She agreed to be treated by auto-SCT. Following 3 X 50 mglkg cyclophosphamide an autologous unmanipulated BMT was performed in January 1994 (Table 1). The anticentromer antibody titer declined (Table 2 ) , and she experienced complete clinical remission for 2 months. In March 1994 the anticentromer antibody titer reincreased to pretransplantation levels and 4 weeks later she was in full clinical relapse.
C a s e 2. The 52-year-old female patient has suffered from Hashimoto's thyroiditis since 1973 and from severe

Patients
This report summarizes the experience of four bone marrow transplantation (BMT) units (Genoa, Hamburg, Heidelberg, and Kiel) with patients who received high-dose therapy and subsequent auto-SCT either solely for an autoimmune disease or for a malignancy but simultaneously suffered from a concomittant autoimmune disease with serologic autoimmune markers. Being aware of the difficulties in defining "true" autoimmune diseases, we did not define inclusion criteria for the term "autoimmune disease."
Four patients with one or two clear autoimmune diseases (CREST syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis) and one patient with atopic dermatitis were identified (Table
1).

*Two PBPCT's were performed

thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis since 1983. Myasthenic symptoms were diplopia, ptosis, proximal limb weakness progressing to myasthenic crisis requiring assisted ventilation, resulting in an Disability Status Scale of Oosterhuis (DSSO) score of 4. Anti-acetylcholine-receptor (AChR) antibodies were elevated as were antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (Table 2). Thymectomy and subsequent treatment with 100 to 150 mg/d azathioprine led to complete clinical remission of the myasthenia gravis with low titers of AChR-antibodies in 1986 (DSSO: 0). Without relapse of the myasthenia gravis (DSS0:O; AChR-antibodies: negative), azathioprine was continued until diagnosis of an ovarian cancer (FIG0 IIIc R2) in

September 1992. Treatment of the ovarian cancer consisted in carboplatin/treosulfane, etoposide/ifosfamide/ cisplatin (VIP), and two cycles (December 1992 and March 1993) of high-dose chemotherapy with ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (Table l), followed each time by unmanipulated auto-PBPCT, leading to complete remission. From May 1993 until September 1993, prophylactic intraperitoneal treatment with interleukin-2 and interferon was performed. The complete remission of the ovarian cancer remained stable until June 1994, then a relapse occured and renewed chemotherapy led to a second remission.

reappeared (DSSO from 0 to 3). AChR antibody levels exceeded pre-SCT levels and antibodies to thyroid peroxidase were elevated (Table 2).
Case 3. The 28-year-old female patient had a 14-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including arthralgia, discoid rash, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, moderate pancytopenian, elevated titers of antinuclear antibodies, and elevated titers of anti-double strandedDNA antibodies." The symptoms responded sufficiently to corticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine. In June 1992, a Bcell centroblastic high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), stage I11 BS with bulky disease, was treated with 5 cycles of cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazinehleomycin/doxorubicin/prednisolone(COP-BLAM), resulting in complete remission in October 1992. A NHL relapse, stage 111 BS, was diagnosed in December 1993. The NHL progressed despite two cycles of Dexa-BEAM and one cycle of dexamethasonekiigh-dose cytarabine/cisplatin (DHAP). Despite these aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens clinical (arthritis and malar rash) and serological (Table 2) SLE symptoms persisted. In June 1994, high-dose chemotherapy according to the BEAM protocol" (Table 1) followed by unmanipulated auto-PBPCT was applied and resulted in complete remission of the NHL and in complete clinical remission of the SLE, but serological SLE symptoms persisted: antinuclear antibodies partly exceeded pre-SCT levels (Table 2). Cytopenia persisted throughout. A bone marrow biopsy on day +180 revealed normal cellularity. One day +352 after SCT, hypocomplementemia was detected for the first time, and the patient developed clinical signs of relapsing SLE, including oral ulcers and increasing pancytopenia with severe thrombocytopenia and elevated antiplatelets antibodies. The thrombocytopenia led to a lethal intracerebral hemorrhage on day +378. The NHL was still in complete remission.
Case 4. This 58-year-old male patient had suffered from atopic dermatitis affecting up to 15% of the body surface area since early childhood. Treatment of the excoriating eczema and pruritus was based on adequate cutaneous hydration and more severe flares were treated with topical glucocorticoids. In April 1994, a centrocytic NHL, stage I11 AE, was diagnosed. Six cyclophosphamide/doxorubicidvincristine/prednisone (CHOP) cycles induced partial remission. Complete remission was achieved following two additional doxorubicin/prednisolone/high-dosecytarabine/cisplatin (ASHAP) cycles. The atopic dermatitis remained active. In April 1995 he underwent total body irradiation and highdose chemotherapy with etoposide and cyclophosphamide (Table l), followed by unmanipulated auto-PBPCT. The NHL remained in complete remission. Symptoms of atopic dermatitis disappeared completely after auto-PBPCT. However, only l week after transplantation they reappeared and were more pronounced between day +lo0 and +180 than in pre-SCT years.
Case 5. The 51-year-old female patient had suffered from rheumatoid-factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis since 1979. Despite treatment with corticosteroids, gold salts, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide the rheumatoid arthritis led to progressive joint destruction (Steinbrocker func-

tional grade IV), necessitating joint replacement surgery of knee,hip, and wrist. In June 1994, a high-grade B-cell NHL (anaplastic large cell NHL), stage 11B, was diagnosed. Treatment consisted in 5 CHOP, 1IMVP-16, and 2 ASHAP cycles and led to partial remission (stage 11). The rheumatoid arthritis remained active despite these multiple chemotherapeutic treatments. In June 1995, she underwent high-dose chemotherapy with busulphan, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (Table 1)and subsequent autologous unmanipulatedPBPCT. The lymphoma is currently in complete remission. Arthralgia and arthritis slightly improved for a period of only 5 weeks
+after auto-SCT and on day 120 a severe rheumatoid arthri-
tis flare required treatment with up to 75 mg prednisone per day. Rheumatoid factor exceeded pre-PBPCT levels on day +120 (Table 2).

DISCUSSION

In the five patients described here, intensive cytotoxic

therapy with subsequent autologous transplantation of un-

manipulated SCT failed to induce more than transient remis-

sion of various autoimmune diseases. Clinical andor sero-

logical signs of autoimmune diseases were detectable shortly

after auto-SCT, and in some patients the autoimmune disease

was even exacerbated.

Reappearance of the autoimmune disease was observed

in all five patients. However, the data do not answer the

question whether the reappearance is attributable to: (1) sur-

vival of autoaggressive lymphocyte clones, (2) reinfusion of

these clones, (3) relapse of autoimmune diseases through

recipient-inherent auto-antigen challenge, or (4) reappear-

ance of autoimmune diseases because defective stem cells

were retransplanted.

Autoaggressive lymphocyte clones might have survived

the respective preparative regimen. To date, it is not clear,

if any (or which) myeloablative regimen achieves complete

immunoablation, ie, destruction of all antigen-determined

lymphocytes including resting memory

In our pa-

tients, standard preparative regimens were applied in the

majority of cases, including repeated myeloablation in pa-

tient 2 and a combination of total body irradiation plus high-

dose chemotherapy in patient 4.Possibly, other more effec-

tive immunosuppressive agents, eg, antithymocyte globulin

in addition to high-dose cycl~phosphamidem'~ight increase

the immunoablative potential of a preparative regimen with-

out causing prohibitive toxicity.

Retransplantation of autoaggressive lymphocyte clones

with the autologous graft is another possibility, which could

explain the autoimmune disease recurrence. Allogeneic SCT

transfers the donor immune system (including an eventual

donor autoimmune disease) to the recipient, or can cure an

autoimmune disease of the recipient. This has repeatedly

been observed in animal experiment^'^ and in the c l i n i ~ . ~ , ~ ~ . ' ~

Likewise, pathogenic lymphocyte clones or their precursors

might be transplanted with the autologous graft and might

have caused the rapid recurrence of autoimmune diseases

described here. The retransplantation hypothesis is supported

by the observation of autoimmune disease recurrence in pa-

tient 2, whose prior thymectomy should have rendered it

difficult or impossible to regenerate a new immune system.

EULER ET AL

As another explanation, it cannot be excluded that persisting auto-antigen challenge from the recipient might induce recurrence of the autoimmune disease. However, the transfer of donor autoimmune diseases to the recipient through allogeneic SCT strongly supports the thesis that the autoimmune disease information is graft-inherent and is independent from an additional recipient-inherent stimulus.
Finally, recurrence caused by expansion of defective stem cells might be another explanation for autoimmune disease recurrence after auto-SCT. In several established animal models of autoimmune diseases the autoimmune disease is derived from defective stem cells.'s-20However, there is some evidence that human stem cells may carry only the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, but not the full program necessary to develop a clinical autoimmune disease," and that manifestation of an overt autoimmune disease requires additional external triggers." If human autoimmune diseases were stem cell-inherent, diseases like SLE should occur in the first months or years of life,'' they should occur completely concordant in monozygotic twins,24and treatment-free remission following intensified conventional treatment protocols should not O C C U ~ I.n~th~es~e~si~tuations the immune system obviously regenerates from the respective stem cells without development of an overt autoimmune disease.
If lymphocytes or subsets thereof contained in unmanipulated autografts account for the autoimmune disease recurrence, thorough lymphocyte depletion of the graft might be a promising approach to circumvent this problem. Autologous transplantation of lymphocyte-depleted human stem cells, then, should reimplement the susceptibilityfor the respective autoimmune disease, but the disease would, possibly, not remanifest itself before renewed contact with the exogenous trigger. Techniques for separating hematopoietic stem cells from immunocompetent lymphocytes like purging by means of antilymphocyte antibodies or positive selection of CD34+ stem cells are a~ailable.'~-I't~remains to be settled whether the magnitude of lymphocyte depletion currently achieved by these techniques can prevent regrowth of pathogenic lymphocyte clones.
The importance of lymphocyte depletion is supported by clinical and serological remission in a case of myasthenia gravis and malignant lymphoma following treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous PBPCT of positively selected CD34' cells.3oThe patient had no myasthenia symptoms until renewed chemotherapy for relapsing lymphoma terminated the follow-up 1year later. The hypothesis is further supported by a more recent report describing improvement of symptoms in 2 patients, who underwent autologous BMT for severe multiple sclerosis. The graft was not manipulated, but the patients received antithymocyte globulin after stem cell reinfusion, thus representing possibly an effective way of in vivo purging of the graft." On the other hand, one case report describes remission of a concomitant SLE in a patient with malignant lymphoma following autologous and unmanipulated BMT.32
Another recent report possibly adds evidence supporting the necessity of lymphocyte depletion from the autologous graft for avoidance of autoimmune disease relapses. Cure of

7 of 10 patients with aplastic anemia has been described following high-dose cyclophosphamide (45 mg/kg/d for 4 days; total dose 180 mgkg) without stem cell reinfusion." Accepting that aplastic anemia is at least partially an autoimmune disease, it seems possible that this protocol was immunoablative, destroying completely the autoaggressive lymphocyte clones, and that a de novo regenerating immune system did not remember the antigenic properties of the previous targets.
The grafts were cryopreserved. Cryopreservation was reported to decrease number and function of some lymphocyte subset^,'^ and, thus, should not be responsible for recurrence of an autoimmune disease.
One might discuss, whether conditioning regimens alone might induce autoimmune symptoms through nonimmune cytotoxic organ injury. We regard this as highly unlikely: high-dose chemotherapy or irradiation alone in patients with malignancies usually does not cause exacerbation of preexisting autoimmune diseases, and allogeneic SCT, preceded by identical or similar conditioning regimens, does not lead to exacerbation- but repeatedly to cure-of autoimmune diseases, as has been reviewed el~ewhere.~
In summary, the rapid recurrence or persistence of autoimmune diseases in all five cases reported here should be regarded as a cautionary note against recommending standard myeloablative therapy followed by transplantation of unmanipulated autologous hematopoietic stem cell grafts for autoimmune diseases. If auto-SCT is considered to treat severe autoimmune diseases, effective techniques for depleting the graft of lymphocytes along with more intensive immunoablative preparatory regimens should be investigated.
