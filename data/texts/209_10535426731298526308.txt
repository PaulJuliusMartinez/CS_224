Roomware: Toward the
Next Generation of Human-
Computer Interaction Based
on an Integrated Design of
Real and Virtual Worlds

Norbert A. Streitz

25.1 Introduction

The next generation of human-computer interaction (HCI) is determined by a number
of new contexts and challenges that have evolved during the last ﬁve to ten years and
will be evolving more rapidly in the next ﬁve to ten years. They are rooted in new,
emerging technologies as well as in new application areas asking for new approaches
and visions of the future beyond the year 2000. It is not the intention of this chapter to
give a comprehensive account of all relevant new contexts. We focus on selected areas
complementing other contributions in this book. There is no doubt that new develop-
ments in the ﬁelds of multimedia, hypertext /hypermedia (especially in their popular
versions  as  World  Wide  Web-applications), three-dimensional  representations, and
virtual reality technology will have a great impact on the type of issues HCI has to
address and on how interfaces will look in the future.

Taken  those  developments  as  given, we  present  an  approach  and  a  framework
that—at least so far—has not become a mainstream orientation for guiding design
and  development  of  the  next  generation  of  human-computer  interaction.  We  are
aware of the fact that there are related attempts, and we describe them. Nevertheless,
there is still an indispensable need for a comprehensive framework. According to our
view, the following four areas have to be integrated into an “umbrella” framework:

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Ubiquitous Computing (UbiCom),
Augmented Reality (AR), and Architecture. Note that in this chapter we use the term
architecture primarily in the sense of real, physical environments—like rooms and
buildings—and  not  in  the  sense  of  system  architecture  or  software  architecture.
These areas are not an arbitrary list but rather the necessary constituents for a frame-
work of designing HCI in the future. Their mutual relationships and dependencies
are shown in Figure 25.1.

25.1.1 CSCW

User-interfaces used to be interfaces for single-user applications; now, most applica-
tions are multi-user applications supporting cooperative work. This means that user-
interfaces have to be built in such a way that they always indicate if people are either
working alone, in one of several possible subgroup constellations, or with all members
of their team or organization. The interfaces will provide intuitive ways of sharing
information synchronously as well as asynchronously. People will be able to move
smoothly between the different conﬁgurations without having to change applications.

25.1.2 Ubiquitous Computing

While in the past there was a central mainframe computer with terminals for many
users, the age of the personal computer follows the guideline of one person and one
computer.  Now  we  are  moving  into  an  era  where  one  person  will  have  multiple
devices available in his or her environment. Computational power will be available
everywhere, will be ubiquitous, or ubiquitous computing (Weiser 1991). People will
view and use many of them as rather specialized information appliances (Norman
1998). Our extension of this view is that multiple devices are not only available to
individuals but to groups. Thus, the cooperative nature of multiple devices will be

more in the foreground than it is currently. The devices are networked in several ways
(more and more wireless), allowing to share information between them. People will
use them in parallel as individuals as well as in groups. These devices will differ in
their characteristics—for example, in terms of size from very small (palm size) to
very large (wall size). They will also differ in terms of the functionality they provide
in local as well as in distributed settings.

25.1.3 Augmented Reality

In  contrast  to  virtual  reality, there  are  conceptual  and  technological  developments
emphasizing that the objects of the real environment should and can be augmented
instead  of  diving  into  “cyberspace” or  immersing  into  “virtual  reality.” Augmented
reality is the result of overlaying and adding digital information to real objects or
integrating computational power into them (Wellner et al. 1993). The importance of
“tangible bits” conveyed by real objects (Ishii and Ullmer 1997) is a related approach.
This direction will be even more relevant in combination with the next area: the archi-
tectural environment around us.

25.1.4 Architecture

Finally, HCI and the preceding areas have to be aware of the importance of the real
world—that is, the physical, architectural space around us in which people interact
with the devices. For many HCI applications in the future, the space is constituted by
buildings with their range of ofﬁces, meeting rooms, cafeterias, hallways, stairways,
foyers, gardens, and so on, thus going far beyond the traditional desktop setting. This
motivates a more explicit relationship to the ﬁeld of architecture. Our view is that the
physical space around us provides rich affordances for interaction and communication
that should be exploited. Research in HCI has neglected this larger context by limiting
itself for a long time to the desktop computer. More recently, these issues are now being
addressed, such as with the notion of cooperative buildings (Streitz et al. 1998a).

We will elaborate on the role of these areas to HCI in more detail as we go along,
presenting the design rationale for the development of what we call “roomware” as the
constituents of so called “Cooperative Buildings.” By roomware®, we mean computer-
augmented  objects  resulting  from  the  integration  of  room  elements, such  as  walls,
doors, or  furniture  with  computer-based  information  devices.  Their  characteristics
require, and at the same time provide, new forms of human-computer interaction and of
supporting cooperative work or, more general, cooperative experiences and activities.
With Cooperative Buildings, we indicate the overall conceptual framework as well as
its concrete realization in terms of the envisioned architectural envelope with integrated
ubiquitous IT components resulting in smart artifacts so that the world around us is
the interface to information and for cooperation. In these settings, traditional human-
computer interaction will be transformed to human-information-interaction and human-
human communication and cooperation.

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

The chapter is organized as follows. In Section 25.2, we present three points of
departure  determining  the  requirements  and  challenges  for  the  next  generation  of
human-computer interaction. Related work and technologies are described in Section
25.3. Section 25.4 and 25.5 introduce the basic concepts of our approach: Section 25.4
describes four design perspectives for the workspaces of the future; Section 25.5 intro-
duces the overall framework of “cooperative buildings.” Section 25.6 complements the
conceptual  analysis  with  requirements  taken  from  an  empirical  study.  Section  25.7
describes the implications for designing new forms of human-computer interaction and
cooperation in terms of the “roomware” components and their realization as part of the
i-LAND environment. Section 25.8 and 25.9 provide the description of the network
infrastructure and the BEACH software. Final conclusions are given in Section 25.10.

25.2 Three Points of Departure

In this section, we present three areas as points of departure in order to determine
important  requirements  for  the  next  generation  of  human-computer  interaction:
information and communication technology, work practice and organization, and the
architectural setting of the real world around us.

25.2.1 Information Technology: From the Desktop 

to the Invisible Computer

The introduction of information and communication technology caused a shift from the
physical environment as the place for information objects to desktop displays as the
interfaces to information. In the traditional ofﬁce environments of the past, information
objects were themselves physical objects: paper documents such as books, memos, let-
ters, calendars in the ofﬁce, announcements on bulletin boards in hallways, ﬂip charts,
and whiteboards in meeting rooms. They were created, accessed, and manipulated in a
straightforward way via physical operations with appropriate tools and very little over-
head. Although the “paperless ofﬁce” did not become a reality and probably never will,
these physical information objects have been replaced to a large degree by digital infor-
mation objects such as electronic documents. Large and bulky monitors sitting on desk-
tops and being connected to a PC tower under the table became the standard computer
equipment  in  our  ofﬁces  today.  Desktop  displays  became  the  “holy“  entrance  to
“cyberspace” as the virtual place where one ﬁnds information.

As a result, the main focus of research and practice in human-computer interaction
was and still is concerned with the issues of designing, creating, and using virtual
information spaces to be displayed on desktop computers. But is human-computer
interaction really the goal? Isn’t it human-information interaction and human-human
interaction and cooperation? Shouldn’t we get rid of the computer as a device in the

foreground? Similar to driving a car and not thinking about the underlying machin-
ery and  the  fact  that  one  is  (at  least  in  modern  cars)  interacting  with  20  or  more
microprocessors and computers, one should be able to interact with information in an
intuitive way and be able to cooperate with other people. The basic underlying idea
was expressed by Mark Weiser (1991) in the following way.

The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves
into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.

This vision, although addressed many times in the past, has become again a major
concern in recent years. Technology should be moved to the background and turn
into “calm technology” where the interface will be invisible (Weiser 1998). The com-
puter will be “invisible”—for example, when using information appliances that are
“hiding the computers, hiding the technology so that it disappears from sight” (Nor-
man 1998). We have adopted this perspective but extended it in various directions to
be described in the main part of the paper.

25.2.2 Organization: New Work Practices and Team Work

The  introduction  of  information  technology  in  the  workplace  did  not  only  change
the contents of work but also the work processes. These changes effect the organization
of work in the ofﬁce (desk sharing is an example) as well as the place of work. Working
from home (telework) or in the hotel, on the train, on the plane, or at the customer’s site
(mobile work) results in a higher degree of transitions between individual work “on the
road” and collaborative work at the ofﬁce (for example, group meetings) and between
asynchronous  and  synchronous  work.  In  parallel, new  organizational  forms  have
changed the business world based on new developments in management sciences and
business process (re)engineering efforts. Organizations adopt process and customer-
oriented business models resulting in more ﬂexible and dynamic organizational struc-
tures. A prominent example is the creation of ad hoc and on demand teams in order to
work on a project for a given period of time, solving a speciﬁc problem.

On demand and ad hoc formation of teams requires powerful methods and tools for
the support of different work phases in teams. When evaluating the meeting support
systems we have developed in the past (Streitz et al. 1994), we found in one of our
empirical studies (Mark et al. 1997) that the provision of hypermedia functionality
facilitates  the  division  of  labor  in  team  work. This  resulted  in  better  results  in  the
group problem-solving activities. Furthermore, we investigated the role of different
personal  and  public  information  devices  (networked  computers, interactive  white-
board) and different combinations of them for meeting room collaboration in another
empirical study (Streitz et al. 1997). These results show that groups with a balanced
proportion of individual work, subgroup activities, and full team work achieved better
results than those groups that stayed most of the time in the full-team work conﬁgura-
tion. The degree of ﬂexibility to work in different modes was largely determined by
the range and combination of information devices provided to the team.

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

25.2.3 Architecture: The New Role 

and Structure of Ofﬁce Buildings

In the future, work and cooperation in organizations will be characterized by a degree
of dynamics, ﬂexibility, and mobility that will go far beyond many of today’s devel-
opments and examples. It is time to reﬂect these developments not only in terms of
new work practices and use of information technology but also in the design of the
physical  architectural  environment  so  that  the  workspaces  of  the  future  will  be
equally dynamic and ﬂexible. While the introduction of information and communica-
tion technology has already changed the content of work and work processes signiﬁ-
cantly, the design of the physical work environments such as ofﬁces and buildings
has remained almost unchanged. Neither new forms of organizations nor computer-
supported work practices have been reﬂected in relevant and sufﬁcient depth in the
design of ofﬁce space and building structures. This is especially true for the issues
related to mobile work. If, in principle, one can work anytime anyplace, one could
ask the challenging questions “Why do we still need ofﬁce buildings? Aren’t they
obsolete given the possibilities of modern mobile technology?”

It is our point of view that ofﬁce buildings are still of high value but that their role
will change—must be changed. They will be less the place for individual work and
more the space for planned team work and group meetings as well as for a wide range
of social interactions, such as spontaneous encounters, informal communication, and
unplanned opportunistic cooperation. We are also convinced that social interactions
in co-located settings, as in buildings, are becoming increasingly important for estab-
lishing a corporate identity, group feeling, and trust, because teams with changing
team members and changing tasks are established at much higher rates than before.

These  considerations  are  the  starting  points  for  our  framework  of  cooperative
buildings (Streitz et al. 1998a). They have to be designed as ﬂexible and dynamic
environments that provide cooperative work and experience spaces supporting and
augmenting human communication and collaboration.

25.3 Related Work

As indicated earlier, we are trying to offer a comprehensive framework integrating a
wide range of approaches. Thus, there are a number of developments that have inﬂu-
enced our thinking. Due to the limitations of space, we concentrate here on two areas
of recent developments that are especially relevant: augmented reality and ubiquitous
computing. We selected those because they best reﬂect one of our central beliefs that
the  real  world  around  us  should  be  the  starting  point  for  designing  the  human-
computer interaction of the future. We are also aware that there is a large body of
research in the area of CSCW on which we are building, especially work on electronic
meeting rooms and/or interactive whiteboards where we also contributed (Steﬁk et al.

1987; Pederson et al. 1993, Olson et al. 1993; Streitz et al. 1994; Nunamaker et al.
1995; Schuckmann et al. 1996). Due to lack of space, we decided not to describe this
work in more detail. For an overview of CSCW, see Baecker (1993). Augmented real-
ity can be understood as the counterpart to virtual reality. Rather than wearing gog-
gles or helmets in order to immerse in a virtual world, augmented reality is concerned
with the use of computational devices in order to augment our perception and inter-
action  in  the  physical  world.  For  an  overview  of  initial  work, see  Wellner  et  al.
(1993). A well-known example is the DigitalDesk that uses a video projection of a
computer display as an overlay on paper documents on a real desk (Wellner et al.
1993). A  project  that  uses  front  projection  techniques  is The  Ofﬁce  of  the  Future
(Raskar et al. 1998). It is based on computer vision and computer graphics technol-
ogy utilizing spatially immersive displays (SID’s) in order to surround users with
synthetic images. Their vision is that “anything can be a display surface,” whether it
be a wall or a table. Even objects with irregular shapes can be used. Their major
application is to build systems for shared telepresence and telecollaboration. Other
examples of augmented surfaces were developed by Rekimoto and Saitoh (1999), for
creating hybrid environments, and the ZombieBoard by Saund (1999). In order to
extend the channels of perception and make use of peripheral awareness, so called
“ambient  displays” have  been  proposed.  A  well-known  example  is  the  ambient-
ROOM (Wisneski et al. 1998) where, for example, water ripples are projected on the
ceiling of a room to indicate different activities.

Another direction is the notion of “graspable” user interfaces with “bricks” (Fitz-
maurice et al. 1995) and “tangible bits” (Ishii and Ullmer 1997). This work was also
inspired  by  the  “marble  answering  machine” developed  by  Bishop  (Poynor  1995),
where incoming phone calls are indicated by (physical) marbles that can be placed on a
speciﬁc area for playing the message. We will come back to this idea when we describe
our  Passage  mechanism  (Konomi  et  al.  1999)  in  Section  25.7.6.  Related  to  this
approach is the mediaBlocks system (Ullmer et al. 1998). It uses electronically tagged
blocks to store, transport, and sequence online media. Although they realize a certain
degree of simplicity and “lightweight” mode of operation, “mediaBlocks” have to be
specially crafted before the system is used and can be inserted into dedicated slots.

Ubiquitous computing is in some way a direct consequence when pursuing the
approach of augmented reality seriously. It requires having many, loosely spread and
networked  information  devices  around, with  displays  of  different  sizes, providing
functionality everywhere instead of only at the desktop computer. This is the concept
of ubiquitous computing (Weiser 1991) and ubiquitous media (Buxton 1997). The
size of these devices can range from very small to very large. Some of the devices
will stand out and be recognized as computers; others will be “invisible” as they are
embedded  in  the  environment.  Once  the  physical  space  is  ﬁlled  with  multiple
devices, two sets of issues come up. First, how can you transfer information between
them in an intuitive and direct way, and, more generally, how can you interact with
them? Second, it is desirable to know the position of the devices and their state wher-
ever they are in a room or a building. The ﬁrst issue is addressed by the “pick-and-
drop” technique  (Rekimoto  1997, 1998), and  our  concepts  of  “take-and-put” and

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

“Passage” (Konomi et al. 1999) are described in Section 25.7.6. The second issue
requires  setting  up  an  infrastructure  of  sensing  and  localization  technology  that
determines where the devices are and where users are performing their tasks. (We
know this raises a number of controversial issues with respect to privacy considera-
tions, but they are beyond the scope of this paper.)

25.4 Design Perspectives for the Workspaces 

of the Future

In our vision of the workspaces of the future, we believe the world around us will be
the interface to information, represented via ubiquitous devices, some visible and oth-
ers “invisible,” in the sense that they are embedded in the physical environment. We
anticipate a situation where people interact with each other in ubiquitous and interac-
tive landscapes for interaction and cooperation augmenting our real environments.

In  order  to  develop  the  workspaces  of  the  future, we  follow  a  human-centered
design approach (see Figure 25.2). Since the human is at the center, we ﬁrst must

address the mental space—considering the potential and the limitations of the human
processing system and the individual’s cognitive processing of content and tasks. The
perspective of designing the information space represents the mapping of tasks and
contents on corresponding and compatible representations of the information system
realized as software and hardware. Human problem-solving activities are mapped on
corresponding  ways  of  human-computer  interaction  and  mediated  by  networked
information  devices  providing  the  functionality  needed  for  working  on  the  task.
However, the human is part of a group or a team, and the team has to be viewed in the
context of an organization. This requires consideration of the social space, which
reﬂects the role of different work practices and organizational context in the design
of corresponding cooperation and communication technology. This is (in a way) the
CSCW  perspective.  Finally, we  have  to  take  into  account  the  architectural  space
reﬂecting the characteristics of the rooms and other architectural components of the
building. It is obvious to us that physical objects and their placement in the architec-
tural space provide valuable “affordances” for organizing content information and
meta information for the activities of individuals as well as groups.

In summary, we have to consider all four design perspectives or spaces shown in
Figure 25.2 where the implicit distinction between real and virtual worlds plays a
special role. Although we will come back to this, we want to emphasize here that we
argue for a two-way augmentation and smooth transitions between real and virtual
worlds. Combining them in an integrated design allows us to develop enabling inter-
faces that build on the best affordances of everyday reality and virtuality in parallel.
As designers of human-computer interaction, or rather human-information interac-
tion, and human-human cooperation, we want to use the best of both worlds.

25.5 Cooperative Buildings

Due to the new role of ofﬁce buildings in the future, one has to reﬂect this in the over-
all design of the workspaces of the future. To this end, we proposed the concept of
Cooperative Buildings in Streitz et al. (1998a) and established also a series of Inter-
national Workshops on Cooperative Buildings (Streitz et al. 1998b, 1999b). We used
the term building (and not spaces) to emphasize that the starting point of the design
should be the real, architectural environment: Even a person navigating in the chat
rooms of cyberspace is sitting somewhere in the real space. By further calling it a
“cooperative” building, we wanted to indicate that the building serves the purpose of
cooperation and communication. At the same time, it is also “cooperative” toward its
users, or rather, inhabitants and visitors, by employing active, attentive, and adaptive
components.  In  other  words, the  building  not  only  provides  facilities  but  it  also
(re)acts “on its own” after having identiﬁed certain conditions. It is part of our vision
that  it  will  adapt  to  changing  situations  and  provide  context-aware  information
according  to  knowledge  about  past  and  current  states  or  actions  and, if  available,

even about plans of the people. The three dimensions, shown in Figure 25.3, are use-
ful to structure the requirements for the design of cooperative buildings.

First, we address the “real world vs. virtual world” dimension or, using a differ-
ent terminology, the physical or architectural space vs. the digital information space
or cyberspace. While each terminology has its own set of connotations, we use them
here more or less interchangeably. Our day-to-day living and working environments
are highly determined by the physical, architectural space around us constituted by
buildings with walls, ﬂoors, ceilings, furniture, and so forth. They constitute also rich
information  spaces  due  to  the  inherent  affordances  either  as  direct  information
sources (such as calendars, maps, charts hanging on the walls, books and memos
lying on the desks) or by providing ambient peripheral information (such as sounds
of people passing in the hallway). Furthermore, nonplanned encounters of people at
the copying machine, in the commons, or in the cafeteria are rich opportunities for
the exchange of information, either social or task- and goal-oriented.

While the term building implies strong associations with a physical structure, our
concept of a cooperative building goes beyond this. It is our understanding that a
cooperative building originates in the physical architectural space, but it is comple-
mented  by  components  realized  as  objects  and  structures  in  virtual  information
spaces.  In  a  cooperative  building, we  augment  therefore  the  informal  interaction
spaces in addition to the “ofﬁcial” meeting rooms with information technology, so
that people can create, retrieve, and discuss information in a ubiquitous fashion. This
requires an integration of information spaces and a means of interacting with them in
the physical environment, such as walls and furniture (this results in “roomware”—
see Section 25.7).

There is another aspect of the “virtual” part of this dimension. People are not only
in one physical location but in remote, distributed locations. Associated terms are vir-
tual meetings, virtual teams, and virtual organizations. Our perspective encompasses

a distributed setting with remote locations where people work and dwell. The remote
location might be an ofﬁce building at another site of the organization or in a building
at a client’s site, a teleworker’s small ofﬁce at home, or the temporary hotel room
of a traveling salesperson. Within the framework of a cooperative building, people
can  communicate, share  information, and  work  cooperatively  independent  of  the
physical location. In contrast to today’s restricted desktop-based videoconferencing
scenarios, we  envision  a  seamless  integration  of  information  and  communication
technology  in  the  respective  local  environment. This  results  in  more  transparency
and a direct and intuitive way of interaction, communication, and cooperation in dis-
tributed environments. This approach is in line with the work on media spaces (Bly et
al. 1993) and ubiquitous media (Buxton 1997). If one goes beyond standard desktop
videoconferencing, one is faced with challenging design issues for creating a “shared”
background setting in which the distributed members are placed (Buxton 1997). Fur-
ther  issues  of  distributed  rooms  coupled  via  videoconferencing  are  addressed  by
Cooperstock et al. (1997).

This interpretation of “virtual” is, of course, closely related to the local vs. global
context dimension. This  dimension  addresses  the  issue  that  we  have  to  design  the
local environment with respect to the requirements resulting from its two roles. One
role is to augment individual work and support group work in face-to-face meetings.
The other is to provide an environment that facilitates the global cooperation of dis-
tributed people. While there is an intuitive understanding of the meaning of “local vs.
global,” one has to look at it in more detail. The term “local” is often used synony-
mously with colocated, or “same place.” Think for example of a standard ofﬁce or
meeting room. But what is the scope of the “same place”? Is the hallway part of it
when the door is open? Where are the boundaries? In contrast, where does a “remote”
place begin? Is the meeting room on the next ﬂoor local because it is “nearby” or a
remote place? Does the notion of remote location and global context start in another
building, another city, or another continent? Using sensors for determining positions
facilitates that the information devices know where they are and what their local and
global context is. In this way, the cooperative building can be provided with informa-
tion about the location of people in relationship to the devices. At a more general level,
the local vs. global dimension addresses also the differences in social contexts of work
arising from different organizational structures, either working in a local team or with
other organizational units of a global organization, like a multinational company.

A  third  relevant  distinction  is  based  on  the  individual  vs.  group dimension.  It
emphasizes that the type of support should be able to distinguish, for example, be-
tween different degrees of coupling shared workspaces. This is based on our earlier
work on cooperative hypermedia groupware (Streitz et al. 1994). It should be pos-
sible to determine the degree of coupling by the users and provide awareness about
who is sharing what and to which degree. This dimension reﬂects also the implica-
tions of different phases of team work: plenary presentation and discussion in the
complete group, splitting up in subgroups, working individually on an assigned task,
resuming again for the integration of ideas and merging of intermediary results, and
so on.

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

In summary, it is our opinion that the realization of a “cooperative building” has to
pay attention to these three dimensions in order to constitute the basis for designing,
using, and evaluating the Workspaces of the Future. In our ongoing work of develop-
ing the i-LAND environment (see Section 25.7.1), we concentrate especially on two
of the three dimensions discussed in the previous section: the real vs. virtual and the
individual vs. group dimension.

25.6 Requirements from Creative Teams

While innovative concepts and visionary scenarios as well as advances in basic tech-
nologies are important to make progress, we know from the principles of user-centered
and task-oriented design that this is not sufﬁcient for the development of new systems.
In order to inform our design, we conducted an empirical study investigating the cur-
rent work situation of teams and their requirements for future environments. Due to
limited space, we report only selected results of the study (Streitz et al. 1998c).

We selected ﬁve companies from the automobile and oil industry and in the adver-
tising and consulting business. These companies were chosen because they had special
groups called “creative teams” working in the areas of strategic planning, identifying
future trends, designing and marketing new products, and so on. We interviewed repre-
sentatives of the teams, visited the project and team meeting rooms, and distributed a
questionnaire to all team members. The total number of people in these ﬁve teams was
80. They had academic education with various backgrounds: engineering, computer
science, business administration, psychology, and design.

The results showed that the meeting facilities were in most cases traditional meet-
ing rooms furnished with standard equipment like large, solid tables and chairs, ﬂip
charts, whiteboards, and overhead projectors. In only one case, there were a couple
of computers, a scanner, and a printer permanently installed in the meeting room. No
active creation of content during the meeting was done with the aid of computers.
Different creativity techniques (brainstorming, Metaplan) were used but only in a
paper-based fashion. The results on the current state were somehow contrary to our
expectations because we had expected more (active) usage of computer-based tech-
nology in the meetings.

The situation changed when we asked about the requirements for the future. Usu-
ally, a large room was required with a ﬂexible setup and variable components that
would allow different conﬁgurations. The room should have the character of a market-
place or a landscape providing opportunities for spontaneous encounters and infor-
mal communication. The response (translated from German) was “Team meetings
are not anymore conducted by meeting in a room but by providing an environment
and a situation where encounters happen.” The furniture should be multifunctional
and ﬂexible.

Although the current situation was rather low-tech, there was a great openness for

computer-based support in the following areas.

I Information gathering while preparing meetings in advance by accessing

internal and external databases

I “Pools of ideas”—also called “idea spaces”
I A wide range of creativity techniques where the computer-based version
should allow for ﬂexible conﬁguration or tailoring of the underlying rules
I Presentation styles deviating from the traditional situation and involving
the attendees in an active fashion labeled as “participatory presentation”

I Visualizations inspiring and enhancing the creative process
I Communicating and experiencing content via channels other than only

visual: acoustic, tactile

There  was  less  emphasis  on  videoconferencing  than  we  expected.  The  teams
stressed the importance of personal presence being essential for creating a stimulat-
ing and productive atmosphere. While computer-based support was strongly requested,
the computer should stay in the background. As they explained (translated from Ger-
man), “We have the creative potential, not the computers.” In summary, the teams
wanted to have much freedom in reconﬁguring their physical environment and their
information environment.

25.7 Roomware® Components

Our approach to meet the requirements of ﬂexible conﬁguration and dynamic allo-
cation  of  resources  in  physical  and  information  environments  in  parallel  is  based
on the concept we call roomware®. By roomware, we mean computer-augmented
objects resulting from the integration of room elements—walls, doors, furniture—
with computer-based information devices. While the term roomware was originally
created by Streitz and his Ambiente-Team (Streitz et al. 1997, 1998a) and is now also
a registered trademark of GMD, it is also used for a general characterization of this
approach and even products in this area.

The general goal of developing roomware is to make progress toward the design
of integrated real architectural spaces and virtual information spaces. In the context
of supporting team work, roomware components should be tailored and composed to
form  ﬂexible  and  dynamic  “cooperation  landscapes” serving  multiple  purposes:
project team rooms, presentation suites, learning environments, information foyers,
and so forth. Also, all these goals involve the development of software that enables
new forms of multi-user, multiple-displays human-computer interaction and cooper-
ation. We will present examples as we go along.

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

25.7.1 The i-LAND Environment

On the basis of our conceptual and empirical work as well as integrating ideas from
related work, we created a ﬁrst visualization and description of the planned environ-
ment.  Figure  25.4  shows  the  “vision  scribble” in  spring  1997.  The  environment  is
called i-LAND: an interactive landscape for creativity and innovation. On the one hand,
i-LAND is a generic environment consisting of several roomware components that can
be used in different ways. On the other hand, its development was also application-
driven, especially in terms of the functionality provided by the BEACH software we
developed for working with roomware (see Tandler 2000, 2001, and Section 25.9).
The  original  vision  scribble  showed  the  following  roomware  types: an  interactive
electronic  wall  (DynaWall ®), an  interactive  electronic  table  (InteracTable ®), and
mobile  and  networked  chairs  with  integrated  interactive  devices  (CommChairs®).
This was the initial set of the ﬁrst generation of roomware® and was assembled in the
AMBIENTE-Lab at GMD-IPSI in Darmstadt. Together with the BEACH software,
this set constituted the ﬁrst version of the i-LAND environment in 1997 and 1998. In
1999, we  developed  together  with  partners  from  industry—as  part  of  the  R&D
consortium “Future Ofﬁce Dynamics” (FOD 1999)—the second generation of room-
ware® where we redesigned the CommChairs® and the InteracTable® and developed
a new component called ConnecTable®.

567

In our vision scribble (Figure 25.4), we also suggested workplaces for individual
work—for  example, searching  for  background  information—and  called  them
“columns of knowledge.” Furthermore, we think that there will be always paper in
one way or the other. Thus, we suggested the mobile “ScanTable” as an integrated
device for scanning paper documents so that the content is immediately available for
further processing via the network on different roomware components, for example,
to be shown and annotated on the DynaWall. Since the latter two components were
not so innovative, we built—for the ﬁrst generation of roomware—the previous three
types initially mentioned. Although the focus was on designing workspaces for co-
located teams, the i-LAND environment can easily be extended to provide support
for global cooperation of distributed teams. Further information on i-LAND can be
found in Streitz et al. (1999a). Now we give an overview of the different roomware
components.

25.7.2 The DynaWall®

The objective of the DynaWall® is to provide a computer-based device that serves the
needs of teams for cooperating in project and meeting rooms. It can be considered the
electronic equivalent of large areas of assembled sheets of paper covering the walls
for creating and organizing information. Teams are now enabled to display and inter-
act with large digital information structures collaboratively on the DynaWall that can
be  considered  an  “interactive  electronic  wall.” The  current  realization  consists  of
three segments with back projections and large touch-sensitive display surfaces. The
total display size of 4.50 m (15 ft) width and 1.10 m (3 ft 7 in.) height covers one side
of the room completely (see Figure 25.5). Although driven by three computers, the
BEACH software provides one large homogeneous workspace with no interaction
boundaries between the segments. Two or more persons are able to either work indi-
vidually in parallel or to share the whole display space.

The size of the DynaWall causes new challenges for human-computer interaction.
For example, it will be very cumbersome to drag an object or a window over a dis-
tance of more than 4 m by having to touch the DynaWall all the time (similar to
holding down the mouse button) while walking from one side to the other. Therefore,
we have developed two mechanisms addressing these problems. Similar to picking
up an object from a pinboard and place it somewhere else, our “take and put” feature
allows us to “take” information objects at one position, walk over (without being in
contact  with  the  DynaWall), and  “put” them  somewhere  else  on  the  display.  For
bridging the distance between several closely cooperating people, “shufﬂe” allows us
to throw objects (even with different accelerations) from one side to the opposite side
where they can be caught and used by another team member.

The interaction of creating, moving, and deleting objects and their content is pri-
marily gesture-based and does not require selecting different modes. This mode-less
interaction  is  achieved  by  using  the  incremental  gesture  recognition  provided  by
BEACH. (For more details see Tandler [2000, 2001] and Section 25.9).

DynaWall (ﬁrst generation of Roomware)

25.7.3 The CommChairs®

The  CommChairs® (see  Figures  25.5  and  25.6)  are  mobile  chairs  with  built-in  or
attached  slate  computers.  They  represent  a  new  type  of  furniture  combining  the
mobility  and  comfort  of  armchairs  with  high-end  information  technology.  The
CommChairs allow people to communicate and to share information with people in
other chairs, standing in front of the DynaWall or using other roomware components.
They can make personal notes in a private space but also interact remotely on shared
(public) workspaces—for example, making remote annotations at the DynaWall. The
cooperative sharing functionality is provided by the BEACH software. For maximum
ﬂexibility and mobility each chair is provided with a wireless network and indepen-
dent power supply.

In the ﬁrst roomware generation (see Figure 25.5), we developed two versions.
One has a docking facility (on the left side in Figure 25.5) so that people can bring
their laptop computers and drop them into the swing-up desk, which is part of the
armrest. The other version (on the right side in Figure 25.5) has an integrated pen-
based computer built into the swing-up desk.

In the second roomware generation (Figure 25.6), we made a complete redesign
resulting in the new version shown in the center of Figure 25.6 in front of the DynaWall
and on the right side of Figure 25.7.

25.7.4 The InteracTable®

The InteracTable® (see Figure 25.6) is an interactive table that is designed for creation,
display, discussion, and annotation of information objects. It is used by small groups of
up to six people standing around it. People can write and draw on it with a pen and
interact via ﬁnger or pen gestures with information objects. There is also a wireless
keyboard for more extensive text input if needed. The InteracTable, with its horizontal
setup display and people standing around it at each side, is an example of an interaction
area with no predeﬁned orientations, such as top and bottom, left and right, as found
with vertical displays like monitors of desktop computers. Horizontal and round or oval
displays require new forms of human-computer interaction. To this end, we developed
in BEACH special gestures for shufﬂing and rotating individual information objects or
groups of objects across the surface so that they orient themselves automatically. This
accommodates easy viewing from all perspectives. Furthermore, one can create a sec-
ond view of an object and shufﬂe this to the other side so that the opposite team mem-
ber has the correct view at the same time. Now everybody can view the same object
with the correct perspective in parallel and edit and annotate it.

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

In the ﬁrst roomware generation, a stand-up version (115 cm high—not shown)
was built using a vertical bottom-up projection unit. A high-resolution image was pro-
jected to the top of the table providing a horizontal touch-sensitive display of 65 cm
⫻ 85 cm and a diameter of 107 cm (42 in.).

In the second roomware generation, we made a complete redesign resulting in the
new version shown on the right side of Figure 25.6. In this version, the projection was
replaced by a large touch-sensitive plasma display panel (PDP) with a display size of
65 cm ⫻ 115 cm and a diameter of 130 cm (51 in.).

25.7.5 The ConnecTable®

The ConnecTable® (see left side in Figure 25.7) is a new component that was devel-
oped as part of the second roomware generation. It is designed for individual work as
well as for cooperation in small groups. The height of the display can be quickly
adapted in order to accommodate different working situations: standing up or sitting
in front of it on an arbitrary chair. The display can also be tilted in different angles to
provide an optimal view. By moving multiple ConnecTables together, they can be
arranged to form a large display area (see left side in Figure 25.6). Integrated sensors
measure the distance between the ConnecTables and initiate the automatic connec-
tion of the displays once they are close enough. The cooperative BEACH software
enables the resulting large display area to be used as a common workspace where sev-
eral people can work concurrently and move information objects beyond the physical
borders of the individual displays.

571

In the same way as for the InteracTable, people can create second views, shufﬂe
them from one ConnecTable to the opposite one, rotate them there, and work on them
in parallel with correct perspectives.

The mobility of the ConnecTables and the CommChairs is achieved by employing
a wireless network connection and an independent power supply based on Nickel
Metal Hydride (NiM) accumulators. The IT components are packaged in a translu-
cent container. Because there are no rotating or inductive consumers (using passive
cooling, RAM-disk, etc.), these roomware-components are completely noise free.

25.7.6 The Passage Mechanism

Passage describes a mechanism for establishing relations between physical objects
and  virtual  information  structures—that  is, bridging  the  border  between  the  real
world and the digital, virtual world. So-called Passengers (Passage-Objects) enable
people to have quick and direct access to a large amount of information and to “carry
them around” from one location to another via physical representatives that are act-
ing as physical “bookmarks” into the virtual world. It is no longer necessary to open
windows, browse hierarchies of folders, worry about mounted drives, and so on. Pas-
sage is a concept for ephemeral binding of content to an object. It provides an intuitive
way for the “transportation” of information between computers/roomware compo-
nents—for example, between ofﬁces or to and from meeting rooms.

A Passenger does not have to be a special physical object. Any uniquely detectable
physical  object  may  become  a  Passenger.  Since  the  information  structures  are  not
stored on the Passenger itself but only linked to it, people can turn any object into a
Passenger: a watch, a ring, a pen, glasses, or other arbitrary objects. The only restric-
tion Passengers have is that they can be identiﬁed by the Bridge and that they are
unique. Figure 25.8 shows a key chain as an example of a Passenger placed on a dark
area representing the real part of the “Bridge” device embedded in the margin of the
InteracTable and the interface area in the front of the display representing the virtual
part of the Bridge device.

Passengers  are  placed  on  so-called  Bridges, making  their  virtual  counterparts
accessible.  With  simple  gestures, the  digital  information  can  be  assigned  to  or
retrieved from the Passenger via the virtual part of the Bridge. The Bridges are inte-
grated in the work environment to guarantee ubiquitous and intuitive access to data
and information at every location in an ofﬁce building (Cooperative Building). For
example, a Bridge can be integrated into the tabletop of an interactive electronic table
(InteracTable®) in the cafeteria or mounted in front of an interactive electronic wall
(DynaWall®) in a meeting room.

We developed two methods for the detection and identiﬁcation of passengers. The
ﬁrst  method  enables  us  to  use  really  arbitrary  objects  without  any  preparation  or
tagging. Here, we use a very basic property of all physical objects—weight—as the
identiﬁer.  Therefore, each  Bridge  contains  an  electronic  scale  for  measuring  the

weight of the Passengers (with a precision of 0.1g). This implementation is very dif-
ferent  from  other  approaches  in  this  area  using  electronic  tags  as, for  example,
mediaBlocks (Ullmer et al. 1998). Their approach is similar to our second method
because each Bridge is also equipped with a contact-free identiﬁcation device that
uses radio-frequency-based transponder technology. Small electronic identiﬁcation
tags  (RFID)  that  do  not  need  batteries  are  attached  on  or  embedded  in  physical
objects so that the Passenger can be identiﬁed by a unique value. While identiﬁcation
via  the  weight  of  an  object  provides  greater  ﬂexibility  and  is  used  for  short-term
assignments, the  electronic  tag  method  provides  higher  reliability  and  is  used  for
long-term assignments, but it requires some preparation of the objects. For a more
elaborate description and technical details of the Passage-Mechanism see Konomi
et al. (1999).

25.8 Network Infrastructure

While each of these roomware components has a value of its own, the full beneﬁt is
only available via a comprehensive integration and combined use. The network infra-
structure  provides  the  connectivity  between  the  components, while  the  software
infrastructure provides a wide range of cooperative sharing capabilities. For extend-
ing the mobility of team members and roomware components in the whole building,
it is necessary to identify them in different locations. This requires an appropriate
sensing and localization infrastructure. So far, we are able to identify people in front
of the three different segments of the DynaWall: the InteracTable, the ConnecTables,
and the CommChairs. Extensions are planned.

In  the  current  implementation, we  use  a  combination  of  the  local  area  network
already installed in the building and an RF-based wireless network. For maximum ﬂex-
ibility, all mobile roomware components are connected to the wireless network. The
roomware components are equipped with an antenna that comes along with a PC-Card.
The computers of ﬁxed roomware components—for example, the DynaWall—are con-
nected via cables to the LAN. The network connection for the wireless access to the
LAN is realized by a two-channel access-point that acts as a bridge between the cable-
based and the RF-based Ethernet.

25.9 The Beach Software: Supporting Creativity

As already pointed out, although the design of the roomware components is generic,
the development of the i-LAND environment was also application-driven. The main
application is the support of team work with a focus on creativity and innovation. We
support different types of creativity techniques and related generic functionality as,
for example, visualization of knowledge structures. Other application areas can be
organizational group memory, cooperative design activities, support for teaching and
learning (electronic classroom of the future), and group entertainment environments.
In order to meet the requirements of i-LAND, we developed the BEACH soft-
ware. BEACH, the Basic Environment for Active Collaboration with Hypermedia,
provides an architecture and a user interface adapted to the needs of roomware com-
ponents, which require new forms of human-computer and team-computer interaction.
Furthermore, the  roomware  components  must  be  connected  to  allow  synchronous
collaboration with shared documents distributed over multiple devices. This is also
important for large interaction areas like the DynaWall, which is currently realized
via three separate segments because of the technical limitations of displays currently
available. Other requirements are one user working with multiple devices or com-
posite roomware, dynamic conﬁguration of roomware, modeling also the physical

28036 06 pp. 511-602 r7ah.ps  7/9/01  2:58 PM  Page 574

574

CHAPTER 25 Roomware: Toward the Next Generation

environment, components  to  be  used  by  different  multiple  users  at  the  same  time,
adapting for different orientation and shape of displays, and mode-less user-interface.
BEACH has a layered architecture that is built on top of a core model. A layer with
common models deﬁnes the basic interfaces for documents, user interface, tools, and
interaction styles. On top of these models, a set of generic components is deﬁned that
provides the basic functionality necessary in most teamwork and meeting situations.
This includes, for example, standard data types like text, graphics, and informal hand-
written input (scribbles), as well as private and public workspaces for generic collabo-
ration support. Based on the common models and the generic components modules,
speciﬁc support can be added, which deﬁnes tailored functionality for distinct tasks.
For more details on BEACH see Tandler (2000, 2001). BEACH is built on top of the
COAST framework (Schuckmann et al. 1996) as a platform for the distribution of
objects. COAST was previously developed at GMD-IPSI and was also used for the
implementation of the groupware system DOLPHIN (Streitz et al. 1994).

It was a high-level design goal for the user-interface of BEACH to rely as much as
possible on intuitive actions people are used to in their day-to-day physical interac-
tion space. As a result, gestures and pen-based input are the major interaction types.
Standard input devices like a mouse and a keyboard are also supported but play a
minor role. A prominent and convincing example is the provision of the “shufﬂe”
functionality where users can “throw” objects and depending on the momentum pro-
vided by the user, objects are ﬂying faster or slower and covering a larger or shorter
distance.

In contrast to “normal” mouse input, where the mouse position is always at a single,
exact point, the handling of pen input is a little more demanding. Pen input normally
consists of strokes touching several view objects (UI elements) on the display. This
makes it impossible to use the position of the stroke as a distinct criterion. It is also
important to be tolerant of inaccuracy of the input. Furthermore, it has to be decided
whether a stroke should be interpreted as a command or data input. When a user has
entered a stroke with a pen in the BEACH user interface, the shape of the stroke is
continuously analyzed whether it is of a known form or not. The distinction as to
whether the stroke is interpreted as a gesture invoking a command or as scribbled
information is completely up to the controller handling pen events. It offers the possi-
bility of context-sensitive semantic gestures.

BEACH offers a mode-less user-interface where the user does not have to select
different modes before an action. It does not matter if he or she wants to provide
handwritten input via a scribble or to make a “command” gesture operating on exist-
ing objects or creating new objects. This is achieved by implementing an incremental
recognition of gestures: While a stroke is recorded, the current shape is continuously
computed. This is then used to give feedback to the user (via different colors of the
lines created) and inform him or her in this way about the operation resulting from
this action.

25.10 Conclusion

We have presented the design and implementation of roomware components as cen-
tral constituents of our vision of “Cooperative Buildings” for the workspaces of the
future. They are based on an integrated design of real architectural and virtual infor-
mation  spaces  going  beyond  the  traditional  desktop  computer.  Our  approach  is
related to and was inspired by different developments in human-computer interac-
tion, augmented reality, ubiquitous computing, and computer-supported cooperative
work, in particular meeting support systems.

Our initial experiences are quite promising. In addition to our AMBIENTE-Lab in
Darmstadt, we have had two external installations of i-LAND since May 2000 (one
at the DASA in Dortmund, one at Wilkhahn in Bad Münder) that are still ongoing.
Both were part of registered projects of the world exhibition EXPO 2000 but are still
operated. Previous to that, we demonstrated i-LAND at different international fairs
(CeBIT 1999 and 2000; Orgatec 2000). In October 2000, the roomware components
of  the  second  generation  won  the  International  Design Award  of  the  state  Baden
Württemberg in Germany. More information about our future developments can be
found at http://www.darmstadt.gmd.de/ambiente.

A ﬁnal comment: Considering the affordances of the architectural space as a guid-
ing  metaphor  for  designing  environments  supporting  the  cooperation  between
humans and their interaction with information is a very important perspective for us.
Mechanisms like “Passage” employing arbitrary real world objects as “Passengers,”
interaction forms like “throwing” information objects on large interactive walls, and
other activities reported here seem to provide new intuitive forms of cooperation and
communication.  They  are  pointing  in  a  similar  direction  as  related  developments
emphasizing the importance of physical, tangible objects summarized in the section
on related work. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how far the use of these concepts
and metaphors will actually carry. In the end, this is an empirical question that has to
be answered, and we plan to address it. There is also a need for a more comprehen-
sive approach as it is the objective of the new EU-funded proactive initiative “The
Disappearing Computer” (www.disappearing-computer.net).
