ABSTRACT
Paraphrynus grubbsi n. sp. is described from both an adult male and female from caves in the Huautla de JimCnez region of Oaxaca, Mexico. The new species is the sixth troglobiticmember of the genus.A taxonomic key to troglobitic Paraljhrynus is provided.
INTRODUCTION
Mullinex (1975) revised the genus Paraphrynus Moreno. She accepted 15 species from Central and North America and the northern West Indies. Garcia Acosta (1977) and Reddell (1981) provided some new records from Mexico, but no new species were described. Quintero (1983) revised the species of the genus from Cuba but only recognized four Cuban species. Quintero synonymised I? astes Mullinex from Cuba with an older name that was not recognized by Mullinex. He deemed another species [I? intermedius (Franganillo, 1926)l that was accepted by Mullinex to be a dubious species. Since then, a new Paraphrynus species was described from Mexico by Mullinex (1979) and Quintero (1979) placed the Guatemalan I? leptus Mullinex as a synonym of I? emaciatus Mullinex.

Almost half of the approximately 100 species of amblypygids are known from caves (Weygoldt, 1994; Armas and Perez, 1994; Harvey and West, 1998). Of these, the vast majority are troglophiles. Troglobites are known from the Phrynidae (Phrynus noeli Arrnas and Perez, 1994from Cuba and five Paraphrynus spp. from Mexico) and the Charinidae (Charinus sp. = diblemma Simon, 1936 [nomen dubium according to Weygoldt, 19941 from Zanzibar, Tanzania, and two species of Charinus (Speleophrynus ) from caves in Venezuela). The present contribution describes the sixth troglobitic species of Paraphrynus.
METHODS
The specimens examined are deposited in the American Museum of Natural History, New York (AMNH) and the Texas Memorial Museum, Austin (TMMC).
Morphological terminology and methods for making measurements essentially follow Mullinex (1975), except for the nomenclature of some of the pedipalp and leg segments. We follow Harvey and West (1998) in the naming of appendages.We also use cephalothorax

rather than carapace; the latter being reserved for members of the Crustacea. The pedipalp segments and their alternate names used by Mullinex (in parenthesis) are: coxa (gnathocoxa), trochanter, femur, patella (tibia), tibia (basitarsus), and tarsus. In some species, the tarsus is further divided into a post-tarsus. The leg segments
are: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia (tibia +
basitarsus), metatarsus (tarsus l), and tarsus (tarsus 24). The first pair of legs are modified into antenniform appendages, with the tibiae and tarsi being greatly subdivided. Tibiae 11-IV are subdivided into a basitibia and a distitibia. Basitibiae IV are further subdivided into three segments and numbered 1-3 from the proximal end. Quintero (1981) called these segments proximal tibia, pre-basitibia, and basitibia, respectively. The distitibia (basitarsus of Mullinex, 1975) is easily recognized because it has long series of trichobothria on its distal end (Fig. 3). The metatarsus (tarsus 1 of Mullinex, 1975) is not divided. Tarsi 11-IV are subdivided into three segments and numbered 1-3 here (proximal to distal, respectively). Our tarsal segments 1-3 are equal to Mullinex's tarsal segments 2-4.
The male holotype and allotype female were measured. The other three females were not measured because Amblypygi molt after reaching maturity

(Weygoldt, pers. comm., 1998) and our N value was low. Because size varies with age we have tried to emphasis shapes and numbers of structures rather than size.
The genital sternites were removed from the abdomen and examined while they were immersed in lactophenol at room temperature.
We numbered all the spines on the pedipalp femur and patella of the male. Like Quintero (1981), we found that these numbers do not necessarily correspond with those on any other species. None the less, this system of numbering is useful for discussing variation in spination. Some of the major spines can be recognized in other species, but the homologies of others have not been demonstrated. See the illustrations (Figs. 1,2) for spine numbers. Spines are numbered from dorsal (d) and ventral (v), femur (f) and patella (p), proximal to distal (I-x). Thus, df4 would be the fourth spine from the proximal end on the dorsal surface of the femur. We did not fully illustrate the pedipalp trochanter or tibia; preferring to simply record the spines as numbered by Mullinex (1975). Some details of these structures are present in Figs. 6, 7.
Trichobothrial designations (Fig. 3) of the distitibia follow Weygoldt (1970).

Identification.-The eyed species of Paraphrynus can be identified by using the taxonomic keys by Mullinex (1975) for North American species and Quintero(1983) for West Indian species.The six species of troglobitic (with reduced or missing eyes) Paraphrynus (all from Mexico) can be identified by the taxonomic key.

Variation.4ignificant variation was noted in the material examined. The median eyes of the holotype are of unequal sizes (left one twice as large as right), obviously an anomaly. The eye sizes, interdistances and size of tapetum vary between individuals. The tapetum is apparent under all the eyes in the male and ranges in size down to complete absence in a female. One female had all the lateral eyes separate, whereas each of the others has at least a tiny portion of two eyes (pairs vary) touching or joined. Because the eyes are not pigmented and the lenses are small this observed variation might be due in part to the difficulty in viewing these structures. There is also variation in the spination patterns of the pedipalps. Figs. 1, 2, 6, 7 show the number of spines as found on the single male. Variations found in the females were mostly bifurcations of spines and missing smaller spines. The variations found were: (female from S6tano de SanAgustin) vf4+vf5 combined to form single bifurcate spine on one pedipalp; tiny spine added between dp5, dp6 and dp9, dp10 on one pedipalp: df9, dfl 1,dp8 missing. (Cueva del Escorpion) dp 12 on both pedipalps with small tooth on spine; vfl on one pedipalp replaced with tiny spine; single tiny spine in front of dpl on one pedipalp; vp5 missing. (Cueva cerca
