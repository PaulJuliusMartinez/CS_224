Technology Management Strategies: A Post TRIPS Study of Punjab
Manufacturing
*Ravi Kiran **Vijay Jain
Global competitiveness has forced the companies to initiate effective steps to improve overall productivity and efficiency. Past experience shows that Indian firms took decades to be able to catch up with global productivity levels. The present study has been undertaken with the objective to study the Technology Management Strategies used by the Punjab Manufacturing. The study is an attempt to highlight the extent of Intellectual Property Rights of Punjab Manufacturing and to recommend the factors for developing IPR Culture for Punjab manufacturing. The results of the study highlight the IPRs in Punjab Manufacturing are still low and the firm wise analysis depicted that Small firms reported low investment in R& D and no IPRs. So effort had to be focussed on improving the IPR culture. The results depict that i) Awareness and Facilitation and ii) Enhancing the pace of registration are the important factors for developing IPR culture. The firms responded that Govt. Assistance for facilitating Patent filing and Support for Entrepreneurial and Managerial Development for SMEs could help in improving the situation.
Field of Research: Intellectual Property Rights, Technology Management

1. Introduction
In the Post-liberalisation era, Indian firms have been under tremendous pressure to improve their competitiveness. The removal of restrictions on imports and the lowering of customs duties implied that Indian firms have to be as competitive as their international corporations in order to survive. This has accelerated the process of technological absorption. Several companies also pushed ahead in improving production and improving their products so as to be able to add value to their products and improve profitability. More recently, in the last decade, the emphasis has been shifting to innovation and product development. Several industries, particularly the automobile, IT and the pharmaceutical industries have of late been focusing on a high level of product innovation activity. The relationship between intellectual property protection and international trade has been one of the most controversial issues in global negotiations in recent years.

Kiran & Jain 
The debate has been largely about the implications of the agreement on the TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) for international trade in general, and for developing countries in particular. Most of the views expressed by developing countries on the TRIPS agreement arise from their interest in technological development. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) play an important role in protecting innovations from being imitated by others and organisations now have to formulate IPR strategies that complement their competitive strategies. Many of the views expressed by developing countries stem from their perception that the TRIPS agreement affects their ability to use technological knowledge to promote public interest goals such as health, nutrition and environmental conservation.
In order to unleash full innovative potential, there is a need to put in place a National Innovation policy, which encourages competition among enterprises, greater diffusion of knowledge and increased support to early stage technology development initiatives and grass root level innovators. There is a need to foster increased collaboration among R&D institutes, universities and private sector enterprises and leverage upon their cumulative strengths in designing and implementing various innovation programmes.
The present study has been undertaken with following broad objectives:
1. To study the impact of Technology Management Strategies on performance of Punjab Manufacturing.
2. To study the extent of Intellectual Property Rights of Punjab Manufacturing. 3. To recommend the factors for developing IPR Culture for Punjab manufacturing.
The present research will try to study the changes in Technology Management Strategies of Punjab Manufacturing in the Post-TRIPS period and suggest the steps for enhancing Global Competitiveness. The study will focus on the following research questions.
i. What is the impact of stronger patent protection on Overall performance of the firms?
ii. What is the effect of stronger patent protection on the IPRs?
The paper has been organised in five sections. Section1 is the introduction, Section 2 covers literature review. Section 3 highlights the research methodology used. Section 4 deals with research analysis with focus on the Technology Management strategies of Punjab Manufacturing firms. The strategies were considered to study the impact of innovation activity on Production quantity, quality and reduction in costs and impact on overall performance. Finally Section 5 highlights the conclusion of the study.

2. Review of Literature
The manufacturing sector is an important sector in the Indian economy comprising about 31 percent of the non-agricultural sector, which makes up 75 percent of the overall GDP in India (Kalirajan and Bhide 2005). Available evidence suggests that the share of manufacturing sector in GDP at constant prices has been around 17 percent in the 1990s. Productivity growth has long been recognized as an important driver of economic growth and a determinant of international competitiveness of a country in relative to others. According to Krugman (1994), a higher growth in output due to growth in total factor productivity (TFP) is preferred to an input driven growth as the inputs are subjected to diminishing returns. A study by Kiran et al. (2005) covering the period 1980-81 to 2002-03 depicts a deceleration in growth of value added and Total factor productivity in Post-reform period. In this changing environment of greater openness and competitiveness there is an urgent need for the industries to become more productive and then help the economy to achieve a higher growth. Hence higher investment in R&D and encouraging firms for IPRs can play a vital role in enhancing productivity of Indian Manufacturing.
Intellectual property is vital because it is a stimulus to innovation, a vehicle for technology transfers, and a magnet for financing. (Idris, 2002) A study by Haakon (2004) focussed the need of IPRs and benefits to the different concerns. Planning for implementing such strategy demands an engagement across the whole organization affecting projects, processes and culture of the company. R & D should focus on uniqueness and trigger creativity, Invention and Innovation. Kanwar et al. (2001) study the empirical relation between the protection of intellectual property rights and technological change (and hence between the former and economic growth). The researchers found evidence that the former encourages the latter, insofar as intellectual property protection was found to have a strong positive association with R&D investment. This relation continued to hold even when several pertinent control variables were allowed for. Researchers felt that the results may have been even more pronounced, if they had reliable, quantifiable evidence on the implementation aspect of intellectual protection across countries. Many developing countries may appear to have strong protection laws on their statutes but are rather remiss in their implementation. The study results imply that the lack of an incentive structure can be a significant mitigating factor for technological change even when other constraints such as internal funds, availability of skills and trade orientation may not be binding.
Maheswary et al. (2008) opine that small-scale industries have failed to cope up with the emerging challenges to keep abreast with the latest developments especially, in the field of IPRs. In India most of these industries are lagging far behind and facing technical obscurity, being unaware about management of their Knowledge based assets like IPRs. Each player in a given field would try to outpace its competitors by introducing new products through innovations. The authors highlight the reason for protecting Intellectual wealth, role of government in making the small enterprises viable and also what measures should be and are being taken. The study also deals with the steps taken for creating IPR culture and suggests the initiatives for smallscale industries. In order to be competitive in today's world of globalisation and liberalization Indian organizations have to use of advanced technology, technical manpower, and innovative research and development (Narain et al., 2004).

According to Hassan et al. (2006) Successful organizations in today's business environment are those who manage along with their technological resources their human resources also well. It includes effective manpower planning, recruitment and selection process, realistic performance plans and development oriented performance appraisal, effective learning system providing ample learning opportunities with the help of training, performance guidance and other mechanism such as mentoring. It also consists of mechanism to inculcate sense of pride in work, high degree of organization commitment, introducing such organizational development systems as personal growth labs, creativity workshops, quality circles, Kaizen team building exercises etc.
Organizations perform better when they are making investment in training their employees and broaden their skills (Hollbeche, 1998). Employee's creativity and innovation skills can increase only by giving them appropriate recognition and reward for their creative work. (Koning, 1998). Sheel (2002) states that for technological advances new infrastructures, mainly telecommunication, information technology, new strategic thinking practices are needed for hyper competitive environment. Smilor et al. (1988) opine that infrastructure (i.e. advanced equipments and resources) is one of the most important factors to be employed to support public and private projects regarding research and development, innovation and technology modernization.
Sethi et al. (2007) highlight that various factors may be quite important to manufacturing firms trying to compete with flexibility competence and technological capabilities. Human factor in term of their skills, technical expertise, training involvement, and attitude has been found to be the most significant for achieving flexibilities. The technology import process includes need assessment, selection, negotiation, acquisition, adoption and adaptation of Technology. For gaining competitive advantage and developing firm's internal capabilities, Technology adoption and adaptation are considered to be among the most critical elements for a firm (Khamba and Singh, 2001).
A study by Chaturvedi et al. (2006) highlights that Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) have raised for Indian firms a perceived need for R&D and technological strength. For firms that have given little attention to research and innovation in the past, this transition is very difficult. Indian firms have to respond to these changes in novel and complex ways. Employing firm-level case studies, this study examines the contemporary strategic approaches adopted by Indian leaders for integrating new knowledge and capabilities in order to develop innovation competencies for tomorrow.

5. Conclusion
In recent years, a lot of attention has been paid to technology and, increasingly, to innovation and its role in the creation of wealth and the increased well-being of nation's. The rising cost of scientific and technological development has increased the importance of IPR protection, as well as the incentive to engage in cooperative R&D. The results of the study highlight that firms in Punjab have to focus on improving the status of IPRs in Punjab manufacturing. The firms responded that the highest impact of innovation has been on: i) Improved quality of goods and services, ii) Improved Environmental impact or Health Safety aspects. Enhancing Global competitiveness and Improving Performance emerged reasons for protecting IPRs. The IPRs are low and the firm wise analysis depicted that Small firms reported low investment in R& D and no IPRs. So effort had to be focussed on improving the IPR culture. The firms responded that Govt. Assistance for facilitating Patent filing and Support for Entrepreneurial and Managerial Development for SMEs could help in improving the situation. In this period of intense competition, falling prices and waferthin margins, it is essential to attract and invest in creative minds. Focussing on Intellectual property, the organizations have to develop the ability to harness the creative energies of their own available workforce. The need of the times is to focus on creating and encouraging human capital. It is this pool of creative minds that will help in generating innovative ideas. Companies now have to formulate IPR strategies that complement their competitive strategies.
