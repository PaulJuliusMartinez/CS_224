Preface

As recently as the 1990s, studies showed that most people preferred getting information from other people rather than from information retrieval (IR) systems. Of course, in that time period, most people also used human travel agents to book their travel. However, during the last decade, relentless optimization of information retrieval effectiveness has driven web search engines to new quality levels at which most people are satisfied most of the time, and web search has become a standard and often preferred source of information finding. For example, the 2004 Pew Internet Survey (Fallows 2004) found that "92% of Internet users say the Internet is a good place to go for getting everyday information." To the surprise of many, the field of information retrieval has moved from being a primarily academic discipline to being the basis underlying most people's preferred means of information access. This book presents the scientific underpinnings of this field, at a level accessible to graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates.
Information retrieval did not begin with the Web. In response to various challenges of providing information access, the field of IR evolved to give principled approaches to searching various forms of content. The field began with scientific publications and library records but soon spread to other forms of content, particularly those of information professionals, such as journalists, lawyers, and doctors. Much of the scientific research on IR has occurred in these contexts, and much of the continued practice of IR deals with providing access to unstructured information in various corporate and governmental domains, and this work forms much of the foundation of our book.
Nevertheless, in recent years, a principal driver of innovation has been the World Wide Web, unleashing publication at the scale of tens of millions of content creators. This explosion of published information would be moot if the information could not be found, annotated, and analyzed so that each user can quickly find information that is both relevant and comprehensive for their needs. By the late 1990s, many people felt that continuing to index the whole Web would rapidly become impossible, due to the Web's

exponential growth in size. But major scientific innovations, superb engineering, the rapidly declining price of computer hardware, and the rise of a commercial underpinning for web search have all conspired to power today's major search engines, which are able to provide high-quality results within subsecond response times for hundreds of millions of searches a day over billions of web pages.
Book organization and course development
This book is the result of a series of courses we have taught at Stanford University and at the University of Stuttgart, in a range of durations including a single quarter, one semester, and two quarters. These courses were aimed at early stage graduate students in computer science, but we have also had enrollment from upper-class computer science undergraduates, as well as students from law, medical informatics, statistics, linguistics, and various engineering disciplines. The key design principle for this book, therefore, was to cover what we believe to be important in a one-term graduate course on IR. An additional principle is to build each chapter around material that we believe can be covered in a single lecture of 75 to 90 minutes.
The first eight chapters of the book are devoted to the basics of information retrieval and in particular the heart of search engines; we consider this material to be core to any course on information retrieval. Chapter 1 introduces inverted indexes and shows how simple Boolean queries can be processed using such indexes. Chapter 2 builds on this introduction by detailing the manner in which documents are preprocessed before indexing and by discussing how inverted indexes are augmented in various ways for functionality and speed. Chapter 3 discusses search structures for dictionaries and how to process queries that have spelling errors and other imprecise matches to the vocabulary in the document collection being searched. Chapter 4 describes a number of algorithms for constructing the inverted index from a text collection with particular attention to highly scalable and distributed algorithms that can be applied to very large collections. Chapter 5 covers techniques for compressing dictionaries and inverted indexes. These techniques are critical for achieving subsecond response times to user queries in large search engines. The indexes and queries considered in Chapters 1 through 5 only deal with Boolean retrieval, in which a document either matches a query or does not. A desire to measure the extent to which a document matches a query, or the score of a document for a query, motivates the development of term weighting and the computation of scores in Chapters 6 and 7, leading to the idea of a list of documents that are rank-ordered for a query. Chapter 8 focuses on the evaluation of an information retrieval system based on the relevance of the documents it retrieves, allowing us to compare the relative

performances of different systems on benchmark document collections and queries.
Chapters 9 through 21 build on the foundation of the first eight chapters to cover a variety of more advanced topics. Chapter 9 discusses methods by which retrieval can be enhanced through the use of techniques like relevance feedback and query expansion, which aim at increasing the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents. Chapter 10 considers IR from documents that are structured with markup languages like XML and HTML. We treat structured retrieval by reducing it to the vector space scoring methods developed in Chapter 6. Chapters 11 and 12 invoke probability theory to compute scores for documents on queries. Chapter 11 develops traditional probabilistic IR, which provides a framework for computing the probability of relevance of a document, given a set of query terms. This probability may then be used as a score in ranking. Chapter 12 illustrates an alternative, wherein, for each document in a collection, we build a language model from which one can estimate a probability that the language model generates a given query. This probability is another quantity with which we can rank-order documents.
Chapters 13 through 18 give a treatment of various forms of machine learning and numerical methods in information retrieval. Chapters 13 through 15 treat the problem of classifying documents into a set of known categories, given a set of documents along with the classes they belong to. Chapter 13 motivates statistical classification as one of the key technologies needed for a successful search engine; introduces Naive Bayes, a conceptually simple and efficient text classification method; and outlines the standard methodology for evaluating text classifiers. Chapter 14 employs the vector space model from Chapter 6 and introduces two classification methods, Rocchio and k nearest neighbor (kNN), that operate on document vectors. It also presents the bias-variance tradeoff as an important characterization of learning problems that provides criteria for selecting an appropriate method for a text classification problem. Chapter 15 introduces support vector machines, which many researchers currently view as the most effective text classification method. We also develop connections in this chapter between the problem of classification and seemingly disparate topics such as the induction of scoring functions from a set of training examples.
Chapters 16, 17, and 18 consider the problem of inducing clusters of related documents from a collection. In Chapter 16, we first give an overview of a number of important applications of clustering in IR. We then describe two flat clustering algorithms: the K -means algorithm, an efficient and widely used document clustering method, and the expectation-maximization algorithm, which is computationally more expensive, but also more flexible. Chapter 17 motivates the need for hierarchically structured clusterings (instead of flat clusterings) in many applications in IR and introduces a number of clustering algorithms that produce a hierarchy of clusters. The chapter

xviii Preface
also addresses the difficult problem of automatically computing labels for clusters. Chapter 18 develops methods from linear algebra that constitute an extension of clustering and also offer intriguing prospects for algebraic methods in IR, which have been pursued in the approach of latent semantic indexing.
Chapters 19 through 21 treat the problem of web search. We give in Chapter 19 a summary of the basic challenges in web search, together with a set of techniques that are pervasive in web information retrieval. Next, Chapter 20 describes the architecture and requirements of a basic web crawler. Finally, Chapter 21 considers the power of link analysis in web search, using in the process several methods from linear algebra and advanced probability theory.
This book is not comprehensive in covering all topics related to IR. We have put aside a number of topics, which we deemed outside the scope of what we wished to cover in an introduction to IR class. Nevertheless, for people interested in these topics, we provide the following pointers to mainly textbook coverage:

Preface

xix

Chapters 1 through 5 assume as prerequisite a basic course in algorithms and data structures. Chapters 6 and 7 require, in addition, a knowledge of basic linear algebra, including vectors and dot products. No additional prerequisites are assumed until Chapter 11, for which a basic course in probability theory is required; Section 11.1 gives a quick review of the concepts necessary in Chapters 11, 12, and 13. Chapter 15 assumes that the reader is familiar with the notion of nonlinear optimization, although the chapter may be read without detailed knowledge of algorithms for nonlinear optimization. Chapter 18 demands a first course in linear algebra, including familiarity with the notions of matrix rank and eigenvectors; a brief review is given in Section 18.1. The knowledge of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is also necessary in Chapter 21.

B., Jaap Kamps, Mounia Lalmas, Amy Langville, Nicholas Lester, Dave Lewis, Stephen Liu, Daniel Lowd, Yosi Mass, Jeff Michels, Alessandro Moschitti, Amir Najmi, Marc Najork, Giorgio Maria Di Nunzio, Paul Ogilvie, Priyank Patel, Jan Pedersen, Kathryn Pedings, Vassilis Plachouras, Daniel Ramage, Stefan Riezler, Michael Schiehlen, Helmut Schmid, Falk Nicolas Scholer, Sabine Schulte im Walde, Fabrizio Sebastiani, Sarabjeet Singh, Alexander Strehl, John Tait, Shivakumar Vaithyanathan, Ellen Voorhees, Gerhard Weikum, Dawid Weiss, Yiming Yang, Yisong Yue, Jian Zhang, and Justin Zobel.
And finally there were a few reviewers who absolutely stood out in terms of the quality and quantity of comments that they provided. We thank them for their significant impact on the content and structure of the book. We express our gratitude to Pavel Berkhin, Stefan Bu¨ ttcher, Jamie Callan, Byron Dom, Torsten Suel, and Andrew Trotman.
Parts of the initial drafts of Chapters 13, 14, and 15 were based on slides that were generously provided by Ray Mooney. Although the material has gone through extensive revisions, we gratefully acknowledge Ray's contribution to the three chapters in general and to the description of the time complexities of text classification algorithms in particular.
The above is unfortunately an incomplete list; we are still in the process of incorporating feedback we have received. And, like all opinionated authors, we did not always heed the advice that was so freely given. The published versions of the chapters remain solely the responsibility of the authors.
The authors thank Stanford University and the University of Stuttgart for providing a stimulating academic environment for discussing ideas and the opportunity to teach courses from which this book arose and in which its contents were refined. CM thanks his family for the many hours they've let him spend working on this book and hopes he'll have a bit more free time on weekends next year. PR thanks his family for their patient support through the writing of this book and is also grateful to Yahoo! Inc. for providing a fertile environment in which to work on this book. HS would like to thank his parents, family, and friends for their support while writing this book.
