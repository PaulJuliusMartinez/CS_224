Abstract
The urbanization process around water-bodies has caused damage to the environmental balance. The dumping of sewage and effluents into rivers and lakes is responsible for the increased organic matter that results in an overage of microorganism populations that cause diseases in humans and other animals. The application of chlorine, the main disinfectant used for water treatment, can result in formation of carcinogenic compounds, which justifies the search for natural disinfectants without environmental toxicity. This work reports the evaluation of M. oleifera flower protein preparations for the presence of phenolic compounds, alkaloids and trypsin inhibitor activity. In addition, we evaluated antibacterial activity from M. oleifera flower preparations against bacteria strains that may be present in contaminated water and their use for treatment of water

from Cavouco Lake, Recife, Brazil. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericide (MBC) protein concentrations were determined. Proteins were the main components in aqueous extract (MoE, 17.9 mg/mL of protein) and precipitated protein fraction (MoPF, containing 9.49 mg/mL) while phenolic compounds were detected in low concentration. Alkaloids were absent in both preparations and trypsin activity (425 mU/mL) was reduced to 125 and 212 mU/mL in the presence of MoE and MoPF, respectively. MoE and MoPF were active against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella enteritidis) and Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The preparations were most active against E. coli, the best indicator of water fecal contamination; MIC of 0.023 and 0.018 mg/mL as well as MBC of 0.366 and 0.297 mg/mL was obtained to MoE and MoPF, respectively. MoE was a potential disinfectant agent when added to lake water at ratios from 1:1 to 1:100. MoPF inhibit growth of bacteria from lake water only at 1:1 ratio. The results reveal that M. oleifera flowers contain biomolecules with antibacterial activity and potential for use in disinfection of contaminated water.

1. INTRODUCTION
Water is essential to emergence and development of life; despite of this, water is the most poorly managed resource in the world (Buchholz, 1998; Fakayode, 2005). The natural waters contain microorganisms and residues of substances, such as salts, particles in suspension as well as many constituents of organic matter from various origins (Silva et al., 1996).
Human settlements located in coastal regions are responsible for the discharge into rivers and lakes of organic matter, pathogenic microorganisms and toxic compounds such as metals, surfactants, dyes and pharmaceuticals (Ramaiah et al., 2002). Currently, about 50 % of the population from developing countries is exposed to polluted water sources due to discharge of approximately 95 % of their untreated urban sewage directly into surface waters (Pimentel et al., 2007). Waterborne infections account for 80 % of all infectious diseases worldwide and 90 % of all infectious diseases in developing countries (Epstein et al., 1994; Pimentel et al., 2007).
Conventional treatment of water comprises steps of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection; this last corresponds to the most important step in the inactivation or removal of pathogenic microorganisms from water (Lazarova et al., 1999; Alcântara et al., 2001). In disinfection step, chemical (halogens, potassium permanganate, ozone and hydrogen peroxide) or physical (radiation and heat) agents are used aiming to prevent diseases (Meyer, 1994; Water Environment Research Foundation, 1995).
Disinfection by chlorination has been successfully used for waterborne diseases control due to its microbicidal property (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004; Gopal et al., 2007). However, chlorine reacts with humic substances resulting from decomposition of organic matter present in water and produces several by-products with long term harmful effects; the main byproducts of chlorination in wastewater are the trihalomethanes (Figure 1) chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dichlorobromomethane, and bromoforms (Gopal et al., 2007).

Genotoxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity have been reported for the by-products resulting from chlorination process (Ashbolt, 2004; Lisha et al., 2007). Several epidemiological studies suggest an association between the ingestion of chlorinated drinking water and the risk of bladder, rectal and colon cancers (Gopal et al., 2007); in addition, stomach, brain, pancreas, lung and liver cancers were also reported and may be associated with the effect of chlorinated by-products (Keegar et al., 2001). In according to Gopal et al. (2004) trihalomethanes and haloacetic acid constitute the main by-products responsible to cancer development.

Figure 1. General formation reaction (A) and structure (B) of trihalomethanes.
There are thousands of other compounds formed by the reactions between substances present in environmental water and several xenobiotics dissolved in water, including disinfectants, drugs, steroids, insect repellents, detergent metabolites, fragrances, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and solvents (Kolpin et al., 2002; Snyder, 2003). These compounds may induce abnormal sexual development or endocrine disruption in fish (Jobling et al., 1998; Snyder, 2003).
Bacteria of faecal origin are indicator organisms used worldwide to monitor the quality of water and may be associated with infectious diseases (Goñi-Urriza et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2005). Coliforms and, more recently, faecal streptococci are the microorganisms most commonly used to verify the microbiological quality of water; E. coli is the indicator organism which meets all the requirements of an ideal indicator (Silva et al., 2000). Indicator and pathogenic bacteria (Table 1) present in natural waters can carry genes that confer resistance to several antimicrobial agents; this resistance has been observed with the disinfectants currently used (Esteves, 1998, Meirelles-Pereira et al., 2002, Borowsky et al.,

272 Maiara C. Moura, Emmanuel V. Pontual, Francis S. Gomes et al.

2006; Silveira, 2006). Despite of this, the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to disinfectant products are still poorly understood (Russel, 1998; McDonnell and Russel, 1999).

Moringa oleifera Lam. (Moringaceae family) is a tree native from northeastern India widely distributed in tropical regions (Bezerra et al. 2004; Karadi et al., 2006). M. oleifera has several industrial and medical applications (Ghebremichael et al. 2005; Suarez et al., 2003, 2005; Vieira et al. 2010). Its seeds are used for oil extraction and as natural coagulant for water purification in developing countries (Kalogo et al., 2000; Okuda et al., 2001; Abdulkarim et al., 2005; Anwar et al., 2007). The flowers have antioxidant property due to the presence of -and -tocopherol and are used for treatment of ascites, rheumatism and venomous bites as well as cardiac stimulant (Lizzy et al. 1968; Anwar et al., 2003, 2007; Sánchez-Machado et al. 2006).
Antibacterial activity has been described for M. oleifera tissues (Anwar et al., 2007). Antimicrobial peptides from M. oleifera seeds disrupt the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae and E. coli by inducing inhibition of enzymes or disruption of bacterial cell membrane (Silvestro et al., 2000; Suarez et al., 2003; Vieira et al., 2010). Antibacterial activity of M. oleifera flowers has been also reported and this effect has been attributed to the alkaloid pterigospermin (Ruckmani et al., 1998; Anwar et al., 2007; Falasca and Bernabé, 2008).
Antimicrobial proteins and peptides from bacteria, fungi, plants and animals have been evaluated as antibiotics and disinfection agents for water, surfaces and other materials (McDonnell and Pretzer, 2001; Suarez et al., 2003; Kamysz and Turecka, 2005; Desbois et al., 2010). The need to find natural and biodegradable compounds for appropriate water disinfection without generation of harmful by-products stimulated us to evaluate the effect of protein preparations from M. oleifera flowers (aqueous extract and precipitated protein fraction) on indicator and pathogenic bacteria; minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericide (MBC) concentrations were determined. In addition, we report their use in disinfection of environmental water. The presence of phenolic compounds, alkaloid and trypsin inhibitor in M. oleifera preparations was also evaluated.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Plant material
M. oleifera Lam. (Division Magnoliophyta, Class Magnoliopsida, Subclass Dilleniidae, Order Capparidales, and Family Moringaceae) has the vernacular names "moringa" in Portuguese, "árbol del ben" in Spanish and horseradish tree in English. Flowers were collected in Recife City, State of Pernambuco, and Northeastern Brazil. A voucher specimen is deposited under number 73,345 at the herbarium "Dárdano de Andrade Lima" (Empresa Pernambucana de Pesquisa Agropecuária, IPA, Recife, Brazil).

2.2. M. oleifera flower preparations
M. oleifera fresh flowers (10 g) were added to distilled water (20 ml) and homogenized in a blender (10 min at 27°C), followed by filtration through cotton/gauze and centrifugation (9,000 g, 15 min, 4 ºC); the clear supernatant obtained was called M. oleifera extract (MoE).

274 Maiara C. Moura, Emmanuel V. Pontual, Francis S. Gomes et al.
Soluble proteins in extract were precipitated by adding ammonium sulphate (0-60 %) as described by Green and Hughes (1955). The 0-60 % precipitated fraction from M. oleifera flowers (MoPF) was dissolved in distilled water and dialyzed against distilled water (4 h). MoE and MoPF were evaluated for protein concentration, total phenolic content, presence of alkaloids and trypsin inhibitor activity as well as antibacterial activity.
2.3. Protein content
The protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (1951) using bovine serum albumin (31.25 ­ 500 µg/ml) as standard.
2.4. Total phenol content
Total phenol content of MoE and MoPF was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method based on the reduction of phosphomolybdic­phosphotungstic acid reagent by phenols in alkaline solution (Morais et al., 1999). Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (1:10 solution in distilled water; 2.5 ml) and sodium carbonate (75 g/l solution in distilled water; 2 ml) were added to MoE or MoPF (0.5 ml) and the mixtures were kept at 50 ºC for 5 min. After cooling for 30 min, the absorbance was measured at 760 nm. Tannic acid was used as standard (calibration curve: 9.6 to 48 µg/ml solutions in distilled water).
2.5. Investigation of M. oleifera flower preparations for alkaloids
The presence of alkaloids in MoE (15 µl) and MoPF (15 µl) were evaluated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica sheet (Merck, Germany) using a mobile phase (100:11:11:26 [v/v] EtOAc/HCOOH/AcOH/H2O) and the Dragendorff's reagent as specific revealer (Wagner and Bladt, 1996).
2.6. Inhibition of bovine trypsin by M. oleifera flower preparations
Trypsin inhibitor activity was assayed using 0.1 mg/ml bovine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 0.02 M CaCl2. Bovine trypsin (5 µl) was incubated (5 min, 37 ºC) with MoE (50 µg of protein) or MoPF (50 µg of protein) in Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Following, the synthetic substrate N-benzoyl-DL-arginyl--nitroanilide (BApNA) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added (5 µl) and the mixture was incubated (30 min, 37 ºC). The substrate hydrolysis was followed by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm (A405nm) and the inhibitory activity was determined by remaining hydrolytic activity towards BApNA. One unit of trypsin activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 µmol of BApNA per minute under the established conditions.

2.7. Antibacterial activity of M. oleifera flower preparations
Antibacterial activity of MoE and MoPF was evaluated on Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis ATCC-6633, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC-6057 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC29665, Proteus mirabilis UFPEDA 767 - INCRS, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-27853 and Salmonella enteritidis UFPEDA 414- MM6247) bacteria. Bacterial strains were provided by Departamento de Antibióticos, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil. Stationary cultures were maintained on Nutrient Agar (NA) and stored at 4 ºC.
Bacteria were cultured in Nutrient Broth (NB) and incubated at 37 ºC for 3 h. The culture concentrations were adjusted turbidimetrically at a wavelength of 600 nm to 105-106 colony forming units (CFU)/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined. A 1/1000 dilution in NB of a 105-106 CFU overnight culture was prepared. Samples of flower extract (17.9 mg/ml of protein) and precipitated protein fraction (9.49 mg/ml of protein) were diluted 1:2 in NB and diluted further in a series of 10 double dilutions, to a final ratio of 1:2048. A 180 µl aliquot of each dilution was dispensed into each well of a microtiter plate. All the wells were inoculated with 20 µl of the 1/1000 bacterial inoculum and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 h. Assays for each concentration were made in triplicate. After incubation, the optical density at 490 nm (OD490) was measured using a microplate reader. MIC was determined as the lowest concentration at which there was 50% reduction in optical density relative to the control well OD495 (Amsterdam, 1996).
Minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) was determined from the MIC. Aliquots (10 µl) from each well of the treatments that were found to inhibit bacterial growth were transferred to a petri dish containing NA medium and incubated for 48 h at 28 ° C. MBC corresponded to the lowest concentration showing no bacterial growth.

2.8. Environmental water disinfection by M. oleifera flower preparations
Antibacterial activity of flower preparations was also evaluated using Cavouco lake water collected at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. Lake water was diluted 1:4 with MilliQ® water. Aliquots of MoE (9­900 µg of protein) and MoPF (4.7­470 µg of protein) were added to lake water (500 µl) to obtain ratios (sample/lake water) of 1:1, 1:2.5, 1:10, 1:50 and 1:100. Distilled water was used as negative control. The assays were incubated at 37 ºC. After 14 h, 50 µl of each mixture were placed in Petri plates containing Nutrient Agar (NA), and incubated at 37 ºC for 12 h; bacterial growth was then observed. The assay was performed five times.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Components of M. oleifera flower preparations
MoE and MoPF showed high protein concentration of 17.9 and 9.49 mg/mL, respectively. Low content of phenolic compounds was determined for MoE and MoPF (0.034

276 Maiara C. Moura, Emmanuel V. Pontual, Francis S. Gomes et al.
and 0.042 mg/mL, respectively). TLC revealed that MoE and MoPF did not contain alkaloids. These results reveal that proteins were the main components of these M. oleifera flower preparations.
The presence of trypsin inhibitor was revealed since the initial trypsin activity (425 mU/mL) was reduced for 125 and 212 mU/mL in presence of 50 µg of protein from MoE and MoPF, respectively. This data suggests that MoE contains different molecules capable to inhibit trypsin which were not all precipitated by ammonium sulfate since MoE caused higher decrease in trypsin activity than MoPF.

3.2. Antibacterial activity and environmental water disinfection by M. oleifera flower preparations

The consequences of sewage disposal into water-bodies as well as the emergence of resistant bacteria stimulated us to evaluate M. oleifera flower preparations for antibacterial activity against strains that may be present in contaminated water.
MoE and MoPF were able to impair the growth of bacterial strains (Table 2). MoE showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against B. subtilis and E. coli inhibiting S. aureus, S. enteritidis and P. mirabilis. MoPF was able to inhibit and kill B. subtilis, E. faecalis, S. enteritidis, P. mirabilis and E. coli; bacteriostatic effect was detected for S. aureus. Other plant extracts were active against the bacteria used in this work; a stem bark extracts of Tamarindus indica showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against B. subtilis, E. coli, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa (Doughari, 2006) and methanolic extracts of Otodtegia persica were active against E. faecalis (Asghari et al., 2006). Ethanolic leaf extract of Davilla elliptica inhibit Salmonella sp. (Soares et al., 2009).

According to MIC and MBC values, MoPF showed a higher activity against B. subtilis, E. coli, E. faecalis and S. aureus in comparison with MoE, suggesting that the active principle may be proteins that were concentrated by treatment with ammonium sulfate. However, MoE inhibited the growth of S. enteritidis and P. mirabilis with lower MIC than MoPF; interestingly, MoPF unlike MoE killed S. enteritidis and P. mirabilis strains. Together, these results indicate that M. oleifera preparations contain different antibacterial agents. Antibacterial preparations with nonspecific activity constitute the most efficient disinfectants acting on several microorganisms (De Souza et al., 2003).
MoE and MoPF were not active against P. aeruginosa or K. pneumoniae. Similar to our results, the extract from grapefruit seeds did not kill or inhibit strains of Pseudomonas sp. (Sundheim and Langsrud, 1995) and the extract from Croton urucurana showed no action against K. pneumoniae (Junior et al., 2009). P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae have developed resistance to antiseptics and disinfectants (Pires et al., 2009; Abreu et al., 2010; Dienstmann et al., 2010). The absence of activity of MoE and MoPF on P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae growth is in agreement with the known resistance of these bacterial strains. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified as hyper-expression of efflux pumps and loss or reduced expression of outer membrane proteins as well as increase in Mg2+ that strengthens the linkages between molecules of lipopolysaccharides (Masuda and Ohya, 1992; Li et al., 2000; Miyagi et al., 2000; Gales et al., 2001; Livermore, 2002; Pellegrini et al., 2007).
The presence of the antibacterial alkaloid pterigospermin in M. oleifera flowers (Falasca and Bernabé, 2008) stimulated us to evaluate the presence of alkaloids in M. oleifera flower preparations. The absence of these secondary metabolites rules out the involvement of pterigospermin in antibacterial activity of MoE and MoPF. This result, combined with the low phenolic content of preparations, may indicate that the antibacterial agents of MoE and MoPF are mainly proteins or peptides. Thus, MIC and MBC values are presented in protein concentration in Table 2.
Antibacterial activity of proteinaceous protease inhibitors has been reported (Silva and Filho, 2002; Ngai and Ng, 2004; Kim et al., 2005). In an attempt to identify compounds that may be responsible for antibacterial activity, we determined the effect of M. oleifera flower preparations on bovine trypsin. The presence of higher trypsin inhibitor activity in MoE than in MoPF may be related with the different spectral of activity of these preparations observed on antibacterial assay. Antibacterial activity of protease inhibitors may be due to inhibition of proteolytic enzymes involved in diverse physiological processes of bacteria or to interaction between inhibitors and membrane proteins of bacteria leading to changes in cell permeability and induction of microorganism death (Supuran et al., 2002; Chou and Cai, 2006; Li et al. 2007; Kim et al., 2009). Further researches are required to explain the antibacterial mechanism of M. oleifera flower preparations.
A comparison of MIC and MBC values reveals that both MoE and MoPF were most strongly active against E. coli, the best indicator of water faecal contamination. These results reveal the effectiveness of MoE and MoPF in treatment of contaminated water since this faecal indicator bacterium may be more resistant to disinfection procedures than other pathogenic bacteria (Cabelli et al., 1983). The high activity of MoE and MoPF on E. coli is evidenced by MIC values (23 and 18 µg/ml of protein, respectively) close to those determined for preparations of isolated peptides, for example Eugenia uniflora seed lectin ­ MIC of 16.5 µg/ml ­ and citropin ­ MIC of 128 µg/ml (Kamysz and Turecka, 2005; Oliveira et al., 2008).

278 Maiara C. Moura, Emmanuel V. Pontual, Francis S. Gomes et al. MoE was a potential disinfectant agent (Figure 2) since it was able to reduce bacterial
growth when added to lake water in ratios from 1:2.5 to 1:100; the growth of microorganism from lake water was abolished after water treatment with MoE in a 1:1 ratio. Unlike the extract, MoPF did not inhibit bacteria growth in ratios from 1:2.5 to1:100 (Figure 3). On the other hand no growth of microorganism from lake water was observed after water treatment with MoPF at 1:1. These results suggest that the molecules active against bacteria from lake water were more concentrated in flower extract; if these molecules were proteins, they were not precipitated or their biological property decreased after ammonium sulfate treatment, similar to the results found for trypsin inhibitor activity in this work.
Figure 2. Assay of disinfection of water from Cavouco lake (Recife, Brazil) using M. oleifera flower extract (MoE). Treatments showed were distilled water (control) and MoE at different ratios.
Recombinant and synthetic forms of a M. oleifera seed polypeptide mediated efficient sedimentation of mineral particles; bacteria and this polypeptide were also capable of disinfecting heavily contaminated water (Suarez et al., 2003) similar to M. oleifera flower preparations. Lemon juice consists in a natural disinfectant for drinking water under laboratory conditions preventing survival of Vibrio cholerae at ratio greater than 1:100 (Aquino and Teves, 2004).

4. CONCLUSION
Aqueous extract and precipitated protein fraction from M. oleifera flowers were active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and impair the growth of microorganisms from environmental lake water. Different specificity of MoE and MoPF on bacteria strains suggests that M. oleifera flowers contain different antibacterial agents. Alkaloids are not involved in antibacterial mechanism of M. oleifera flower preparations which contain low content of phenolic compounds and inhibit trypsin activity. M. oleifera flower preparations are potential sources of disinfection agents to treat contaminated water.
