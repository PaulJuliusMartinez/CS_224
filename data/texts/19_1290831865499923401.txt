Abstract
This paper proposes a practical palmprint recognition algorithm using two-dimensional (2D) phase information. The proposed algorithm (i) reduces the registered data size by registering quantized phase information and (ii) deals with nonlinear distortion between palmprint images by local block matching. Experimental evaluation using palmprint image databases clearly demonstrates efficient recognition performance of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional palmprint recognition algorithms.
1 Introduction
A palmprint, the large inner surface of a hand, contains many features such as principle lines, ridges, minutiae points, singular points and texture, and is expected to be more distinctive than a fingerprint [9]. Conventional algorithms for palmprint recognition are to extract feature vectors corresponding to individual palmprint images and to perform palmprint matching based on some distance metrics [9, 1, 10]. We have proposed a palmprint recognition algorithm using PhaseOnly Correlation (POC) which is an image matching technique using the phase components in 2D Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of given images [2]. The recognition performance of these algorithms is degraded for palmprint images having nonlinear distortion due to movement of a hand and fingers, since these algorithms consider only the rigid body transformation between palmprint images.
In this paper, we propose a practical palmprint recognition algorithm using 2D phase information. The proposed algorithm (i) reduces the registered data size by registering quantized phase information and (ii) deals with nonlinear distortion between palmprint images by local block matching using Phase-Only Correla-

tion. Experimental evaluation using the PolyU Palmprint Database [5] demonstrates efficient recognition performance of the proposed algorithm compared with conventional algorithms.

2 Phase-Only Correlation

We introduce the principle of a Phase-Only Corre-
lation (POC) function (which is sometimes called the
"phase-correlation function") [4, 7, 8].
Consider two N1×N2 images, f (n1, n2) and g(n1, n2), where we assume that the index ranges are n1 = -M1, · · · , M1 (M1 > 0) and n2 = -M2, · · · , M2 (M2 > 0) for mathematical simplicity, and hence N1 = 2M1 + 1 and N2 = 2M2 + 1. The discussion could be easily generalized to non-
negative index ranges with power-of-two image size. Let F (k1, k2) and G(k1, k2) denote the 2D DFTs of the two images. F (k1, k2) is given by

F (k1, k2) =

and

AF (k1, k2) is amplitude and

F (k1, k2) is phase. G(k1, k2) is defined in the same

way. The cross-phase spectrum RF G(k1, k2) is given

by

RF G(k1, k2)

where G(k1, k2) is the complex conjugate of G(k1, k2) and (k1, k2) denotes the phase difference F (k1, k2)- G(k1, k2). The POC function rfg(n1, n2) is the 2D Inverse DFT (2D IDFT) of RF G(k1, k2) and is given

When

two images are similar, their POC function gives a dis-

tinct sharp peak. When two images are not similar, the

peak drops significantly. The height of the peak gives a

good similarity measure for image matching, and the lo-

cation of the peak shows the translational displacement

between the images.

We have proposed a BLPOC (Band-Limited Phase-

Only Correlation) function [3] dedicated to biometric

authentication tasks. The idea to improve the match-

ing performance is to eliminate meaningless high fre-

quency components in the calculation of cross-phase

spectrum RF G depending on the inherent frequency components of palmprint images. Assume that the

ranges of the inherent frequency band are given by

k1 = -K1, · · · , K1 and k2 = -K2, · · · , K2, where 0K1M1 and 0K2M2. Thus, the effective size of frequency spectrum is given by L1 = 2K1 + 1 and L2 = 2K2 + 1. The BLPOC function is given by

where n1 = -K1, · · · , K1, n2 = -K2, · · · , K2, and

k1,k2 denotes

K1 k1 =-K1

.K2
k2 =-K2

Note that the

maximum value of the correlation peak of the BLPOC

function is always normalized to 1 and does not depend

on L1 and L2. In this paper, we employ K1/M1 = K2/M2 = 0.5.

3 Enrollment Stage

The proposed palmprint recognition algorithm consists of the enrollment and matching stages. This section describes the enrollment stage which consists of (i) preprocessing and (ii) feature extraction.
(i) Preprocessing
This step is to extract the palmprint region from an input image. In order to extract the center part of a palmprint for accurate matching, we employ the method described in Ref. [10]. This method uses gaps between fingers as reference points to define the palmprint region as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Figure 1 (b) shows the extracted palmprint region f (n1, n2), where the size of palmprint region is 128 × 128 pixels in this paper. (ii) Feature extraction

In local blocks of palmprint regions, the nonlinear distortion is approximately represented by the translational displacement between local blocks. According to this fact, the palmprint features registered in the database is generated as follows: (i) partition the palmprint region f (n1, n2) into local blocks (Fig. 1 (c)), where the block size is 32 × 32 pixels and the number of local blocks is 16 in this paper, (ii) compute the phase spectrum of local blocks by 2D DFT (Fig. 1 (d)) and (iii) eliminate the meaningless high frequency components and reduce the size of phase information based on the symmetry property of DFT and quantization. The upper half of the phase components is eliminated, since the parameter of the BLPOC function is K1/M1 = K2/M2 = 0.5. The size of local phase features is 130 pixels in this paper. The palmprint features registered in the database is the combined phase features as shown in Fig. 1 (e).

4 Matching Stage

The matching stage consists of two steps: (i) preprocessing and (ii) matching. The preprocessing of the matching stage is almost the same process as that of the enrollment stage. The matching is performed by local block matching using POC. (i) Preprocessing
In order to align the local blocks, the palmprint region g(n1, n2) extracted from the input image is larger

than that of the registered palmprint region f (n 1, n2). In this paper, the size of g(n1, n2) is 160 × 160 pixels

as shown in Fig. 2 (a). Note that the 128 × 128-pixel palmprint region g^(n1, n2) extracted from g(n1, n2) is used in the next step.
(ii) Matching
This step is to evaluate the similarity between two
palmprint regions taking account of nonlinear distor-
tion as follows. The palmprint region g^(n1, n2) is separated into 32 × 32-pixel blocks as shown in Fig. 2 (c). Each block is indicated by g^i(n1, n2) (i = 1, · · · , Nblock). The translational displacement (1, 2) between g^i(n1, n2) and Fi (k1, k2) is estimated using the BLPOC function. The 32 × 32-pixel blocks gi(n1, n2) are extracted from the palmprint region g(n1, n2) as

gi(n1, n2) = g(n1 - 1, n2 - 2).

Figure 2 (e) shows an example of PNR (Peak-to-Noise

5 Experiments and Discussion

This section describes a set of experiments using 1st version and 2nd version of the PolyU palmprint database [5] for evaluating palmprint recognition performance of the proposed algorithm. The 1st version consists of 600 images (384 × 284 pixels) with 100 subjects and 6 different images of each palmprint. On the other hand, the 2nd version consists of 7,752 images (384 × 284 pixels) with 386 subjects and about 20 different images of each palmprint.
The performance of the biometrics-based verification system is evaluated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which illustrates the False Non-Match Rate (FNMR) against the False Match Rate (FMR) at different thresholds on the matching score. We first evaluate the FNMR for all the possible combinations of genuine attempts; the number of attempts is 6C2 × 100 = 1, 500 for 1st version and 74,068 for 2nd version. Next, we evaluate the FMR for all the possible combinations of impostor attempts; the number of attempts is 600C2 - 1, 500 = 178, 200 for 1st version

and 7,752C2 - 74, 068 = 29, 968, 808 for 2nd version. The performance is also evaluated by the Equal Error Rate (EER), which is defined as the error rate where the FNMR and the FMR are equal. The computation time of the algorithm is evaluated by using MATLAB 7.2.0 on Intel Core2 Duo E6850 (3.00GHz×2).
For the 1st version of the PolyU Palmprint database, we compare three different matching algorithms: (A) Zhang's algorithm [10], (B) our conventional algorithm [2] and (C) the proposed algorithm. The experimental results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The proposed algorithm (C) exhibits significantly efficient performance, since the EER is low, the registered data size is small and the computation time is fast compared with the conventional algorithms (A) and (B).
For the 2nd version of the PolyU Palmprint database, we compare the proposed algorithm (C) with the conventional algorithm (A) in Ref. [10]. In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm using the same data set of Ref. [10]. Table 3 shows the experimental results. The reported value of EER in Ref. [10] is 0.6%, while the EERs of the proposed algorithm are below 0.37%. As is observed in the above experiments, the proposed algorithm is particularly useful for recognizing palmprint images.
