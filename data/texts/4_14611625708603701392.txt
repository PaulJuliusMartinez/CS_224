What is OS?

 Unix, Linux, Mac OS X,Windows, iOS, Android...

 Software that manages computer hardware resources and provide common services for

application software

 Tasks: - scheduling of multiple programs

- memory management

- access to hardware

- etc.

Unix Philosophy
 Make each program do one thing well  The output of every program become the
input of another program to combine simple tools to perform complex tasks
 Everything is seen as a file

Shell
 When you log in, your shell (a process) starts in order to allow you to communicate with OS
 Shell provides you with a bunch of commands that let you access the computer system - ls : list file names - pwd : print working directory name - cd : change working directory - top : display sorted information about processes - man : print manual on a command (eg., man ls)

File System
 "Files have places and processes have life" - Kaare Christian  All files are flat ( just a sequence of bytes), but file system is hierarchical  Organized as a tree, each node is a directory where each directory can
contain other files or another directories or both.
 Root directory :"/"  Case sensitive  Files can be referenced either by relative reference or by absolute
reference. ex) > cd /usr/jusub <= change directory to /usr/jusub
> cd jusub <= change directory to jusub ( jusub directory has to be under current directory)
 Shortcuts: "." : current directory, ".." : parent directory, "~" : home directory ex) > cd .. <= move to the parent directory
6

Shell
 A Shell is a Command Interpreter (a program) that turns text to actions - a shell reads a line that you type in, finds the program, and runs it ex) > ls => the shell reads the line `ls', finds the `ls' program, and runs it.
 Popular shells: - sh : Bourne Shell - csh : C Shell - bash : Bourne-Again Shell

8

ls command
 display the names of files  options
> ls -l : list in a long format with more info > ls -a : list also hidden files (ones of which filename starting with ".") > ls -t : list files sorted by modification time > ls -r : list files in a reverse order
9
cp commands
 Copy files (make clones) usage: cp [options] source dest - source: the name of the file you want to copy - dest: the name of the new file Examples) cp /usr/jusub/my.pdf /usr/tiara/my.pdf cp /usr/jusub/my.pdf /usr/tiara/mm.pdf cp /usr/jusub/my.pdf ./mm.pdf (copy to current directory) cp /usr/jusub/my.pdf ../mm.pdf (copy to parent directory) cp /usr/jusub/my.pdf /usr/tiara/ (copy with the same name) cp my.pdf ../ (copy to parent directory with the same name) cp -r /usr/jusub/* /usr/tiara/ ( recursively copy everything under jusub directory into /usr/tiara/, r: recursively, *: all)
11

cd command

 change the current working directory

 ex) > cd /usr/jusub (absolute path)

> cd jusub

(relative path)

> cd ..

( move to parent directory)

> cd ( move to home directory)

10
rm command
 delete files ex) >rm my.pdf >rm -r /usr/jusub ( recursively remove everything under jusub directory)

12

mv command
 move files ex) > mv /usr/jusub/my.pdf /usr/tiara (original one is moved to a new place) > mv /usr/jusub/my.pdf ./ (move to the current working directory) > mv my.pdf your.pdf (rename it if same directory)

File attributes
 Each file has some attributes - permissions, owners, size, access time

13

 Permission bits (user, group, others) :
rwx rwx rwx (r: read, w:write, x: execute) ex) rw- : possible to read and write
r-- : possible to read only rwx : possible to read, write, and execute rw-r--r-- : user can read and write, a member of group can only read, others can only read
15

 mkdir : make directory  rmdir : remove directory  touch : change file timestamp  sort : sort the input file  cat : display the contents of files  wc : count the number of lines, words, letters
* wildcards : matches anything ex) > ls tiara* => it will print all files of which names start with tiara

14

Input/Output Redirection

standard input (STDIN) ex) keyboard

a file or the output of another program

Program

=> Or you can redirect them to
a file or another program

Program

standard output (STDOUT) ex) screen

standard error (STDERR) ex) screen

a file or the input of another program

16

Redirection to a file
 `>` : redirect output to a file ex) ls > f (store the output of `ls' into a file `f ')
 `<` : redirect input to a file ex) sort < f (feed the file `f' to the `sort' program)
17
Shell variables
 ex) HOME : home directory of user PATH : list of places to look for commands
 echo $VAR : displaying shell variables  export PATH=/usr/bin:/usr/jusub/bin/
(if your shell is bash) or setenv PATH /usr/bin/:/usr/jusub/bin/ (if your shell is csh)
 You can set the variables in the startup file ( ~/.bashrc (in bash) or ~/.cshrc (in csh) ) so that you don't have to do it every time you log in.
19

Redirection to another program

 `|' redirect output to another program ex) cat f.txt | wc (redirect the output of the program `cat' to another program `wc') cat f.txt | grep "snsd" > out ( redirect the output of `grep` to a file `out')
 A Pipe `|` is a holder for a stream of data and can be used to hold the output of one program and feed it to the input of another

Program
stdout

stdinProgram

18

Job Control
 kill : Kill a job Ctrl-C : kill the foreground job ex) kill 1876 (1876: process id)
 Ctrl-Z : suspend the foreground job (stop the job, not kill it) fg : resume the suspended foreground jobs
 `&' : run the job in the background ( don't need to wait for the job to complete, also can run multiple jobs in the background) `jobs' program shows background processes ex) sort my.txt & (run sorting in background so that you can do other things at the same time)
 ps or top : check the status of current processes
20

Editor
 vi : text editor created for Unix - still most widely used editor in Unix world - vim : improved version of vi
 emacs : another text editor created for Unix - more extensible

Vi

 Has three modes i, o

Command

mode

ESC

: Return

Last-line mode

Input mode

21 23

Vi editor
 Text editor: enter and modify text cf) Word processor: enter, modify, and format text
 Text Editor Features - Open a file (new or existing) - Enter text - Search & Replace - Copy, Cut, and Paste - Undo and Redo - Save text
22

Vi
 Lastline mode (`:') - used for file-level commands (open, save, quit, help, execute other program, etc)
ex) :q =>quit :w <filename> => write to a file :wq => write and quit :e => open :help <command> :12 => go to the line number 12

24

Vi
 Command mode - Used for editing commands such as insertion, deletion, copy, paste, undo, etc - Essential commands i : convert to insert mode o : open line below cursor and convert to insert mode dd : delete a line 3dd : delete 3 lines u : undo a command Ctrl-r : redo a command v : start visual mode y : copy (yank) to the clipboard p : paste in the clipboard (deleted or copied ones) gg : go to the first line of file shift-g : go to the last line of file 25
Homework #1
 Install Linux  Make a new directory  Run vim  Type in page 1 of the textbook  Copy the first paragraph and Paste it back to the bottom  Replace ` C ' with `Awesome-C'  Save it and Send it to TA by email attachment (use
firefox)
27

Vi
 Search & Replace - Search (command mode) /snsd : search snsd n : repeat search N : repeat search in the other direction % : search for matching parenthesis on `()`,`[]`,or `{}` - Search & Replace (lastline mode) :%s/jusub/taeyeon => change only first occurrence in the file :%s/jusub/taeyeon/g => change all occurrences in the file :%s/jusub/taeyeon/gc => change all occurrences in the file with confirmation
