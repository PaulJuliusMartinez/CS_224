Path-integral Monte Carlo simulations of the 3 vibrational band origin frequency shifts of CO2 in Hen clusters for n = 1 ­ 40 show that although only the asymmetric-stretch mode of CO2 is being excited, the effect of the associated change in the average value of Q1 cannot be ignored. When this fourth degree of freedom is taken into account, the resulting predicted vibrational frequency shifts are in excellent agreement with experiment across this whole range of cluster size. It is also shown that the quality of predictions obtained from simulations on a given potential energy surface can depend significantly on the choice of the analytic function used to represent it. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

I. INTRODUCTION

A remarkable series of recent studies in Refs. 1­7 re-

ported discrete spectra, inertial rotational constants, and vi-

brational frequency shifts for complexes formed by a small

chromophore molecule OCS, N2O, CO, or CO2 with from one to many He atoms. Those results stimulated theoretical

work on determining accurate chromophore-He interaction

potentials, and on simulating the properties of these

chromophore-Hen species. However, all existing studies of such atom-triatom Van der Waals interactions have in-

volved one of two approximations: i the triatomic is treated

as being rigid, or ii one of its internal coordinate was al-

lowed to vary while the others were fixed at either their

equilibrium values or their ground-state average values. This

seemed justified because the available experimental data in-

volve at most the excitation of a single internal mode of the

triatomic molecule, and the various normal modes are nor-

mally expected to be orthogonal to and independent of one

another at low energies.

Two recent studies of He­ CO2 have reported new highquality three-dimensional 3D potential energy surfaces

which explicitly took account of the 3 asymmetric-stretch vibrational motion of rigidly linear CO2.8,9 In both cases, the

O­O = rC1O

distance which defines the symmetric-stretch
+ rC2O  / 2, normal-mode coordinate was held fixed

Q1 at a

value defined by the experimental ground-state inertial rota-

tional constant B0.10 However, the results of the quantum

Monte Carlo simulations of CO2Hen clusters presented

herein show that the Q1 coordinate may not be ignored when

simulating the 3 band origin shifts for CO2 in these clusters.

This result has significant implications for all reduced-

dimension treatments of interactions of triatomic or larger

molecules with atoms or other molecules. In very recent, work Li et al.11 reported the use of path-

integral Monte Carlo PIMC simulations based on the po-

tential energy surface of Ref. 8 to predict the infrared IR vibrational frequency shifts and other properties of CO2Hen clusters for n = 1 ­ 17. As with all earlier work of this type including Ref. 9, their effective two-dimensional 2D potential energy surfaces for He interacting with ground state or vibrationally excited v3 = 1 CO2 were based on ab initio calculations in which the Q1 normal-mode coordinate was held fixed at its ground-state value. The present work shows that this is a poor approximation, at least for this system. Moreover, the long-range parts of the analytic functions used to represent their 2D surfaces were based on free fits to the ab initio points, and not on known theoretical values of the long-range potential coefficients and their anisotropies, a fact which gives rise to unphysical angular oscillations in the resulting difference potential, and hence to incorrect predicted shifts for the larger clusters. Finally, the CO23 vibrational frequency shifts of Li et al. were defined as the differences between the ground-state energies on their two 2D surfaces calculated using quantum Monte Carlo methods. We show here that it takes extremely long simulations for this approach to yield reliable converged results, while a perturbation theory approach can yield reliable results in orders of magnitude smaller simulation times.
II. POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES
The initial He­ CO2 potential energy surfaces used in this work were based on very recent high-quality ab initio calculations which had been fitted to compact analytic 3D and vibrationally averaged 2D Morse/Long-Range MLR functional forms,12 which explicitly incorporate the theoretically known13­16 inverse-power long-range behavior and its anisotropy and dependence on the Q3 asymmetric-stretch coordinate.9 The one-dimensional 1D wave functions v3Q3 used to produce the vibrationally averaged potential surfaces for v3 = 0, and 1 were generated from effective 1D CO2 potentials for the Q3 normal-mode motion in an isolated CO2 molecule which took account of the different average

C­O bond lengths in the ground and first excited 3 levels of CO2.9,10 As indicated in Fig. 1, this definition of the effective 1D eigenstates corresponds to a 3 fundamental transition energy which is quite close to experiment.10 However, the
ab initio points defining our 3D surface, and hence also the
2D surfaces obtained from it, were all calculated with the sum of the C­O bond lengths i.e., the fixed value of Q1 defined by the experimental ground-state CO2 inertial rotational constant.10 In the following, these potentials are identified as the "unmorphed MLRv3¯r0" surfaces for v3 = 0, and 1, where ¯r0 ¯rv3=0 reminds us that the fixed value of Q1 in the ab initio calculation was defined by the experimentally determined10 ground-state v1 , v2 , v3 = 0 , 0 , 0 average C­O bond length.
In addition to purely theoretical 2D and 3D surfaces fitted to analytic generalized MLR functions,12 Ref. 9 determined a radial morphing parameter fRe = 0.995 77 whose application improved the agreement with the experimental microwave data1 for the CO2 ­ He complex by two orders of magnitude, yielding a final rms discrepancy of only 0.000 039 cm-1. An analogous energy scaling of the vibrationally averaged 2D MLR1¯r0, surface was determined by minimizing the discrepancies between calculated transition energies and the 49 published IR data for this complex.17
This second scaling reduced the rms deviation from experiment by an order of magnitude, to 0.0037 cm-1. The 2D
surfaces resulting from these scalings are referred to below as the "morphed MLRv3¯r0" surfaces.
Virtually all reduced-dimension treatments of multidi-
mensional systems make the assumption that to a first ap-
proximation, the average of a property over a neglected co-
ordinate is approximately equal to the value of that property
with that coordinate fixed at its average value. In the present
context, this implies that if we also take account of the de-
pendence of our potential function on the symmetric stretch
coordinate Q1, our effective 3D potential would be defined as
v1Q1VR,,Q3,Q1v1Q1  VR,,Q3;Q¯ 1, 1
where Q¯ 1 = v1 , v2 , v3Q1v1 , v2 , v3 is the average value of Q1 for the given level of CO2. In other words, the actual 3D and 2D potentials for He­ CO20 , 0 , v3 should be based

J. Chem. Phys. 130, 144305 2009

on the average values of the symmetric-stretch coordinate Q1 and the bending coordinate Q2 for CO20 , 0 , v3. The experi-
mental inertial rotation constants of Ref. 10 define average

C­O bond lengths in CO20 , 0 , 0 and CO20 , 0 , 1 of ¯r0 = 1.162 086, and ¯r1 = 1.166 695 Å, respectively. These geometries had been used to calculate the two slightly different effective 1D potentials VCQ¯O1v23Q3 whose wave functions were used to obtain effective 2D potentials from the 3D

ab initio potential of Ref. 9 see Fig. 1. However, the basic

ab initio 3D potential had been determined with the sum of

the C­O bond lengths fixed at twice the average ground-state

value of ¯r0. We have therefore repeated the entire

As a test of our new 2D MLR1¯r1 potential for He­ CO2v3 = 1, we generated predictions of the band origin shift and of the 49 IR transitions of He­ 12C16O2 reported by Weida et al.17 by adding differences between the appropriate
level energies on our current MLR1¯r1 surface for He­ CO2v3 = 1 and our previous9 unmorphed MLR0¯r0 surface for He­ CO2v3 = 0 to the vibrational band origin energy for a free CO2 molecule.10 Table III compares these predictions model C, last row with experiment and with the
analogous predictions generated in Ref. 9 using our earlier
2D surfaces for this system models A and B. As seen here,

obtained with our new model C is much closer to experiment than those associated with either of the models proposed in Ref. 9. Moreover, as will be seen below, the type of energy scaling used to give the degree of agreement seen in the last column for model B seems to have modified the potential energy surface in an unrealistic manner. Thus, no attempt was made to further improve agreement with experiment by morphing our new 2D MLR1¯r1 potential. Predictions of frequency shifts based on the three models of Table III are presented in Sec. IV. Our simulations for clusters containing two or more He atoms used the He­He pair potential of Aziz et al.20

III. SIMULATION METHODOLOGY
A. Finite-temperature path-integral Monte Carlo calculations
Application of PIMC methods to the treatment of doped helium clusters has been discussed extensively in literature.21­38 The present work is based on a finitetemperature PIMC code developed by Blinov and co-workers,30,31,39,40 which takes account of both He-atom exchange and rotation of the chromophore solute molecule. The main features of the method as applied to CO2Hen clusters are summarized below.

fact, in all our calculations the rotational density matrix was calculated using a closed form for a linear rotor,42 while the
translational density matrix was evaluated using the primitive approximation.21 The standard Metropolis algorithm was used in simulating the rotational degrees of freedom,42 while a multilevel Metropolis algorithm21 was used for the transla-
tional degrees of freedom. Bosonic exchange effects were
incorporated into the PIMC algorithm using the worm algorithm.43,44 Details of the implementation of the worm
algorithm and its adoption to rigid molecular systems will be presented in the near future.45

B. Calculating chromophore vibrational frequency shift
When a chromophore molecule is embedded in a molecular cluster, its energy levels and level spacings are shifted from the values for the free molecule. For the 3 vibrational mode of CO2, this is illustrated schematically in Fig. 2. As is customary in treatments of atom-molecule Van der Waals systems, we make the assumption that because the vibrational motion within the CO2 monomer is orders of magnitude faster than the relative motions of the solvent particles here, the He atoms, one can assume an adiabatic separation between these degrees of freedom. As a result, the 3 fundamental transition of CO2 in the helium cluster can then be written as

The band origin vibrational frequency shifts of the 3 fundamental of CO2 can then be obtained from separate calculations of the ground-state energy on the adiabatic surfaces for
clusters formed around CO2v3 = 0 and CO2v3 = 1,

Preliminary frequency shift calculations for CO2 ­ He1 were done in precisely this way. However, because of the small size of the frequency shift, it is very difficult to obtain a reliable value in this manner, since the simulation runs must be extremely long if the statistical uncertainties in the energy are to be small enough for the resulting 0 ¯En values to be well defined.46 This point is illustrated by Fig. 3, which shows that even after simulation runs of about 40 CPU days, the uncertainty in the predicted vibrational frequency shift of CO2 ­ He1 is still 20%! Since the computational effort will increase substantially with the number of He atoms in the cluster, this is clearly not a very practical way of obtaining accurate results for larger clusters.
Fortunately, a massive reduction in the computational effort required to obtain reliable frequency shifts is attained if one uses the perturbation approach of Refs. 47­52. In particular, the Hamiltonians for clusters formed from ground state and vibrationally excited CO2 may be written as

H^ v3=0 = T^ He + T^ cm,CO2 + T^ rvo3t=,C0O2 + V^ Htoet­He + V^ Htoet,­vC3=O02, 16

value which would be independent of cluster size. Thus, to a
good approximation

In this approach, the quantity being averaged does not include the system kinetic energy, so the statistical fluctuations along the path of the simulation are greatly reduced, and a converged result may be obtained relatively rapidly.
Figure 4 shows the convergence of and uncertainties in vibrational frequency shifts for CO2 ­ He1 calculated in this way using the same potential energy surfaces used to generate the results in Fig. 3. The results in the upper segment were obtained when the simulation was promulgated on the 2D He­ CO2v3 = 1 potential surface, while those in the lower segment were obtained using the He­ CO2v3 = 0 surface. The difference between these two results is an indication of the magnitude of the errors introduced by the approximations of Eqs. 18 and 19, and is an order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties associated with the ¯E simulation of Fig. 3. Moreover, further tests showed that this difference depends little on the number of attached He atoms, n.

On comparing Figs. 3 and 4, we see that in roughly 1/20th of the CPU time, the V approach yields predicted
frequency shifts with statistical uncertainties 200 times smaller than does the ¯E method. Hence, the vibrational frequency shifts of CO2 in Hen clusters for n = 1 ­ 40, reported below were performed using the "V" method of Eq. 19. In particular, the frequency shifts were calculated as expectation values of the difference between the vibrationally averaged He­ CO2 pair potentials ¯Vv3R ,  = v3Q3VR ,  , Q3v3Q3, for v3 = 1, and 0, where

C. Convergence study

The "primitive approximation" used for the He­ CO2 density matrix is the main source of systematic error associ-
ated with use of a finite number of time slices in the PIMC
simulation. Table IV presents illustrative results of a conver-
gence study performed to examine the errors in this approximation to the density matrix. They show that V frequency shifts obtained by running the simulation on the
vibrationally averaged v3 = 0 and 1 surfaces converge to very similar values as the number of time slices for translation
and rotation are increased. Theory indicates that "exact" re-
sults can be obtained by quadratic extrapolation of PIMC results for small  values to the limit   0.41 Blinov at al.41 used a quadratic 1D extrapolation based only on the transla-
tional imaginary time step, with a fixed number of rotational
time slices Mrot. An alternate approach is to extrapolate simultaneously with respect to both translational and rotational
imaginary time steps using the expression

Vv3 = a + btrans2 + crot2,

where trans =  / Mtrans, rot =  / Mrot, and Mtrans and Mrot are the numbers of translational and rotational PIMC time slices,
respectively. Both of these extrapolation methods are applied
to the PIMC data for a He­ CO2 complex at 0.37 K. As seen in Fig. 5, when the number of rotational time
slices was fixed at Mrot= 128, the fitted curves dashed curves, red online show clear asymptotic convergence of the PIMC results to limiting trans= 0 values of 0.10544 and 0.10223 cm-1 for propagation on the ground v3 = 0 and excited v3 = 1 vibrationally averaged surfaces, respectively. If the extrapolation is based on both translational and rota-
tional imaginary time steps, a fit to Eq. 20 yields slightly

These 2D fits yield the solid curves blue online in Fig. 5, which clearly show essentially the same asymptotic convergence behavior. Note that data for trans 0.0020 Mtrans 128 were not used in these fits since as seen in Fig. 5, such time steps are too large for the limiting quadratic behavior of Eq. 20 to apply.41 However, the calculated band origin shifts obtained with 256 translational and 128 rotational time slices are only 0.0091 cm-1 8.7% and 0.0088 cm-1 8.7% higher than the asymptotic values of 0.10493 and 0.10162 cm-1 obtained using the ground v3 = 0 and excited v3 = 1 state surfaces, respectively. Hence, to obtain the results reported below, 256 time slices are used for translation and 128 for rotation when estimating the band origin shifts for CO2 ­ Hen clusters with n = 1 ­ 40.
IV. RESULTS: CO2,,3... FREQUENCY SHIFTS IN CO2 ­ ,,He...n CLUSTERS
Our initial frequency shift simulations were performed using both the unmorphed and morphed versions of the vibrationally averaged He­ CO2 surfaces of Ref. 9. The two sets of open triangular points on Fig. 6 show how the band origin frequency shifts calculated for these cases depend on the number of He atoms in the complex. The unmorphed MLR1¯r0 green online "gradient-symbol" results were obtained using the unmorphed vibrationally averaged potentials defined by model A of Table III. While the presence of an abrupt change in slope from blue to red shifts at n = 5, agrees with experiment solid square points, black online, the rate of change with n is clearly distinctly too small, both before and after the turnover.
The Re morphing of Ref. 9 had almost no discernable effect on the calculated frequency shifts, but the effect of the De morphing of the vibrationally averaged v3 = 1 surface MLR1¯r0 led to the distinctly different results shown as triangular blue online "delta" symbols in Fig. 6. Use of the energy-scaled MLR1¯r0 upper-state surface of Ref. 9 clearly brings the rate of growth of the blueshift at small n into

much closer agreement with experiment. This is to be ex-

pected, since the energy scaling factor was determined by

minimizing the RMS discrepancies with the experimental IR

data for CO2 ­ He1, and the next four attached He atoms also occupy roughly the same position with respect to the

CO2 molecule. However, although the band origin shifts still show an abrupt change of slope at n = 5, for n  5 the shifts

predicted using this morphed-potential model continue to

move to the blue, a result in marked disagreement with ex-

periment.

A shortcoming of our initial unmorphed MLRv3¯r0 model A of Table III is its neglect of the fact that although

the average C­O bond length for CO20 , 0 , 1 differs from that for CO20 , 0 , 0, the same average Q1 value was used when computing the ab initio points defining both the v3 = 0 and 1 surfaces.9 The new potentials of the present Tables

atoms form a ring around the CO2 at a Jacobi angle of  = 90° and an average radius of R  3.3 Å, as had been deduced from experiment.5,6 They also show that the next few He atoms form rings at R  4.0­ 4.5 Å with   35° and 145°, while for n  10, those "outer rings" of He atoms are
spread out to larger radial distances, and shift to slightly "tighter" Jacobi angles closer to   45° and 135°. On the lowest segment of Fig. 8, we see that for R  4.0­ 4.5 Å and   35° or 145°, the approximate location of atoms n = 6 ­ 15, the difference potential has negative values ranging from approximately 0.002 to -0.02 cm-1. In contrast, in
the uppermost segment of Fig. 8 the values of the difference potential at those geometries are closer to -0.1 cm-1. This
explains the sharply steeper negative slope of the line joining the round red online points for n = 6 ­ 15, in Fig. 6, compared to that joining the gradient-shaped green online
points. Moreover, in the middle segment of Fig. 6, which is associated with use of the energy-scaled MLR1¯r0 potential of Ref. 9 model B of Table III, the difference potential at
the geometries where He atoms n = 6 ­ 15, would be located
are still weakly positive. This explains the positive slope of the delta-shaped blue online points for n  5, in Fig. 6.
The remarkably good agreement of the open round points in Fig. 6 with experiment solid square points pro-
vides strong confirmation that our new difference potential model, MLR1¯r1 - MLR0¯r0, provides the current best description of the Q3-dependence of the He­ CO2 potential energy surface. It is reassuring to note that the contour pattern

144305-9 Vibrational shifts for CO2 in Hen clusters
3D ab initio calculations were performed with the sum of the C­O bond lengths and hence Q1 held fixed at the average ground-state value of 2¯r0. Numerical values of all of the calculated frequency shifts seen in Fig. 6 may be found in the journal's supplementary data archive.19
V. COMPARISONS WITH OTHER WORK
In very recent work, Li et al.11 reported PIMC calculation of properties of CO2 ­ Hen clusters based on the potential energy surfaces and difference potential of Ref. 8. The properties of their 2D surface for CO20 , 0 , 0 are very similar to those of the MLR0¯r0 surface of Ref. 9 used herein, so we expect little disagreement with their calculations of ground-state properties such as cluster structures and effective rotational constants. However, Fig. 9 shows that their difference potential, the change in the effective 2D surface on vibrationally exciting the CO2, is completely different than any of the difference potentials of Fig. 8. In particular, while the latter are all "redshifting" negative at large R for all angles, the difference potential of Fig. 9 becomes "blueshifting" positive at large R for almost all angles. This is physically incorrect, as Haskopoulos and Maroulis16 showed that the polarizability of CO2, and hence the strength of its attractive dispersion coefficients, increases with Q3 stretching at all angles. Moreover, the implausible sharp oscillatory red-/blue-shifting behavior of their difference potential at small distances, with positive/negative extrema at approximately 15° intervals, differs markedly with the smoothly regular angle dependence of the present recommended difference potential shown in the uppermost segment of Fig. 8.
The open square points on Fig. 6 purple online are vibrational frequency shifts calculated from Eq. 19 using the same ground-state and difference potential surfaces8 used by Li et al.11 As mentioned above, the frequency shifts for n = 1 ­ 5, are determined by the nature of the difference potential in a region centered near R = 3.3 Å and  = 90°, and in a narrow interval near that location, their difference potential see Fig. 9 is quite similar to our recommended surface uppermost segment of Fig. 8. However, the additional He atoms lying near 90-    45° are found at larger radial distances with increasing n, and for n  15, they lie mainly in a region where the difference potential of Ref. 8 is positive blueshifting. This explains the second reversal of slope for the open square points in Fig. 6.
The frequency shift results obtained here using the potential energy surfaces of Ran and Xie8 open square points in Fig. 6 are 0V values generated by directly averaging over their difference potential as per Eq. 19, and the n-dependence of those shifts is clearly explained by the nature of the He-atom density distributions of Fig. 7 and the difference potential of Fig. 9. However, these results differ markedly from those reported by Li et al.11 for those same surfaces, which seemed to show good agreement with experiment for n = 1 ­ 17. This discrepancy is explained by the fact that their frequency shifts were obtained as the quantities 0 En of Eq. 15, differences between the directly calculated ground-state energies on the upper and lower 3 = 1, and 0 2D surfaces. As shown by Figs. 3 and 4 and the

J. Chem. Phys. 130, 144305 2009

associated discussion, it is very difficult to attain reliable

converged results by that approach, especially for larger clus-

ters. Tests performed here show that if the simulation runs

are sufficiently long, one can indeed reasonable agreement with 0V

obtain values.

0En values For example,

in a

100 CPU day calculation for n = 15, using our recommended

the Ran and Xie surfaces also yield values close to the cor-

responding open square point on Fig. 6. Thus, it appears that

the apparently good agreement with experiment of the vibra-

tional frequency shifts in Ref. 11 was a deceptive artifact of incomplete PIMC convergence,55 and that the open square

points on our Fig. 6 are the actual frequency shifts implied

by the potential energy and difference potential surfaces of

Ref. 8.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The present results show that a systematic treatment
which takes account of the different values of the "frozen" symmetric stretch Q1 coordinate in the v1 , v2 , v3 = 0 , 0 , 0, and 0,0,1 states of CO2 provides remarkably good predictions of the vibrational frequency shifts of the 3 fundamental band CO2 in CO2 ­ Hen clusters for n = 1 ­ 40. Precisely analogous calculations based on otherwise equivalent
He­ CO2 potential energy surfaces which neglected the stretching of the average C­O bond length associated with the v3 = 1  0, excitation yielded much poorer agreement. Thus, it appears that an accurate understanding of the effect of excitation of the 3 mode of CO2 on the He­ CO2 interaction potential is obtained only if we also take account of
the associated change in the average value of Q1, which occurs because of anharmonic intermode coupling. On the
other hand, it appears satisfactory to continue to ignore the
bending degree of freedom, since the average value of the bending angle is  = 0 in both of the states of CO2 considered here. In general, our results imply that any attempt to per-
form a reduced-dimension treatment of interactions involving a triatomic or larger molecule should take account of degrees of freedom other than those of direct interest, if the
average values of those coordinates change significantly on
excitation of the mode of interest. An analogous study of the shifts of the 3 vibrational
band origin of OCS in OCS­ Hen complexes found reasonable agreement with experiment up the experimental limit at that time56 of n = 8, in spite of neglect of changes in Q1 on excitation of the 3 mode.54 However, because of the different masses of the O and S atoms and different force constants for the C­O and C­S bonds, the 3 mode of OCS is mainly a local C­O vibration, and very little C­S stretching is associated with 3 excitation. In contrast, for a molecule such as H2O, excitation of one IR active mode will tend to give rise to changes in the average values of other normal-
mode coordinates which would have to be considered when
attempting to determine the interaction potential between
that excited species and other partners.

J. Chem. Phys. 130, 144305 2009

It is important to note that although the ab initio points defining both the He­ CO2 potential energy surface of Ran and Xie8 and those in Ref. 9 and the present work are of similar quality, part of the reason that the frequency shifts calculated from the former are in much worse agreement with experiment open square points and open round points versus solid square points is because of the different analytic functions used to represent those points. In Ref. 9 and the present work, the 2D potential energy surfaces are represented by generalized MLR radial functions based on Eqs. 2 and 3.9,12 It is the fact that the attractive outer branch of this potential is constrained to have the long-range behavior defined by Eq. 3 and its independent theoretically determined coefficients which is responsible for the difference between the large-R segments of the difference potentials shown in Figs. 8 and 9. In contrast, while the attractive portion of the potential form used in Ref. 8 also consisted of a sum of inverse-power terms with angle-dependent coefficients, those coefficients were determined from fits of the ab initio points to their overall potential function form, and the precision of those points was not sufficient to define the correct long-range behavior adequately.
Similarly, the contrast between the compact form of the MLR function, as indicated by the modest numbers of expansion parameters required see Tables I and II versus the somewhat open-ended expansions used in Ref. 8 to represent the short-range part of their interactions, probably explains the spurious oscillatory behavior of the short-range part of the difference potential shown in Fig. 9. This raises the cautionary point that the quality of predictions obtained from simulations using a given ab initio potential energy surface can depend on the quality of the analytic function used to represent it.
An additional warning lesson from the present work is provided by the large discrepancies from experiment at n  5, for frequency shifts calculated using the difference potential based on the "energy-morphed" MLR1¯r0 upper-state potential in Ref. 9 open triangular points in Fig. 6 from model B of Table III. For n = 1 ­ 5, that morphing did indeed improve the calculated shifts relative to the unmorphed gradient-shaped points; model A. However, while that simple one-parameter energy scaling did improve the difference potential at geometries near R = 3.3 Å and  = 90° where the first five He atoms are located, it incorrectly extended the blueshifting domain almost to R = 5 Å over a wide range of angles, which led to the incorrect increasingly blue shifts for n = 6 ­ 14 shown as triangular points blue online in Fig. 6. This shows that a potential energy surface morphing which gives good results for a simple dimer may be incorrect overall, since a single attached atom may only sample a small fraction of the configuration space.
The present work also reaffirms the fact that a "perturbation theory" approach to the calculation of vibrational frequency shifts in clusters47­52 can be orders of magnitude more efficient and reliable than taking differences between independently calculated ground-state energies on the upper and lower state surfaces.
