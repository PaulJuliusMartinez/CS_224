Abstract -- In this retrospective study, a 6-drug (prednisone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and actinomycin-D) chemotherapy protocol with extended maintenance for the treatment of lymphoma was evaluated for efficacy and toxicity in 39 dogs. The complete remission rate was 97%, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 331 d. The median overall survival (OS) was 461 d. Of the variables evaluated for prognostic significance, only immunophenotype and sex were found to be prognostic. Dogs with T-cell lymphoma had shorter PFS and OS than dogs with B-cell lymphoma. Castrated male dogs had a shorter PFS and OS than spayed female dogs. Although the majority of dogs experienced one or more episodes of chemotherapy associated toxicity, the majority of these episodes were mild and self-limiting. The results of this study warrant further investigation into the value of extended maintenance therapy and inclusion of actinomycin-D in combination chemotherapy protocols for canine lymphoma.

Résumé -- Évaluation d'un protocole de chimiothérapie d'association comprenant de l'actinomycine-D pour le traitement d'entretien prolongé du lymphome canin. Dans cette étude rétrospective, un protocole de chimiothérapie d'association de 6 drogues (prednisone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine et actinomycine-D) pour l'entretien prolongé dans le traitement du lymphome a été évalué sur 39 chiens pour son efficacité et sa toxicité. Le taux de rémission complète était de 97 %, avec une médiane de survie sans évolution (SSE) de 331 jours. La médiane globale de survie (GS) était de 461 jours. Des diverses variables évaluées pour la justesse du pronostic, seules l'immunophénotype et le sexe étaient significatives. Les chiens atteints de lymphome des lymphocytes-T avaient une SSE et une GS plus courtes que les chiens atteints de lymphome des lymphocytes B. Les chiens mâles castrés avaient une SSE et une GS plus courtes que celles des femelles stérilisées. Bien que la majorité des chiens ait vécu un ou plusieurs épisodes de toxicité associés à la chimiothérapie, la majorité de ces épisodes étaient légers et se résolvaient d'eux-mêmes. Les résultats de cette étude justifie de plus amples recherches sur la valeur des traitements d'entretien prolongé et l'inclusion de l'actinomycine-D dans les protocoles de chimiothérapie d'association dans le lymphome canin.

varying degrees of involvement of the lymphoreticular system, which includes lymph nodes, liver, spleen, blood, and bone marrow (2). Other reported sites include alimentary tract, lungs, central nervous system, and skin (2,3). Many studies cite the most common presentation as involvement limited to the peripheral lymph nodes (World Health Organization [WHO] stage III) (4­13). Other studies have indicated a higher percentage of cases involving additional organs such as liver, spleen, blood, and bone marrow (WHO stages IV and V) (3,14­18). Untreated dogs usually die within 60 d (19,20). A number of chemotherapy protocols have been reported that result in remission rates of 69% (21) to 96.7% (19), with median progression-free survivals (PFS) of 140 (14) to 282 (18) d and median overall survivals (OS) of 219 (19) to 397 (18) d. The longest remission durations and

survival times have been reported with combination chemotherapy protocols that include doxorubicin (4,7,9,18). Most of these protocols include an induction period, followed by an extended maintenance period (7,9). Recent studies have reported similar results with shorter term protocols (4,18). The value of extended maintenance versus shorter term protocols remains unclear. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the efficacy and toxicity of an actinomycinD-containing sequential combination chemotherapy protocol with extended maintenance for the treatment of canine lymphoma.
Materials and methods
Criteria for selection of cases Medical records of all dogs newly diagnosed with lymphoma and treated with an identical combination chemotherapy protocol at the University of California, Davis, Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital between January 2000 and August 2001 were reviewed. Dogs were not included if they had received prior treatment, other than corticosteroids. All clients were offered the same protocol. Thirty-nine dogs with a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma were eligible for entry into the study.
Data collection The diagnosis of lymphoma was based on histological examination of tissue biopsies or fine-needle aspirate cytologic examinations. All dogs were clinically staged at diagnosis by using the WHO 5-stage criteria for canine lymphoma (Table 1). Dogs presenting with a cranial mediastinal mass as the sole anatomic site of involvement were not placed into a WHO stage category. Pretreatment evaluation included a complete blood (cell) count (CBC); serum chemical profile; urinalysis, with culture if indicated; thoracic radiographs; abdominal ultrasonographs; and, if possible, bone marrow aspirate cytologic examination. Hypercalcemia was defined as a serum calcium concentration  2.85 mmol/L (reference range, 2.48 to 2.85 mmol/L). When immunophenotyping was available, dogs were further classified as having B- or T-cell lymphomas. Immunophenotyping for determining B lymphocytes (CD79a clone HM57; Dako Corporation, Carpenteria, California, USA) versus T lymphocytes (CD3 episolon clone CD3-12; Serotec, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA) was performed by using routine streptavidin biotin horseradish peroxidase immunohistochemical staining on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections or fresh cytologic preparations (15).
Chemotherapy protocol and assessment of toxicity Chemotherapy was administered according to the schedule in Table 2. This protocol is a modification of a previously reported extended maintenance protocol (7). A CBC was performed prior to each chemotherapy treatment. Week 1 treatment drugs, L-asparaginase and vincristine, were separated by 2 to 7 d if dogs were cytopenic, clinically ill (substage b) (Table 1), or had evidence of high WHO stage (IV or V) at time of 1st treatment.
Chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity were graded as outlined in Table 3.

Scheduled treatments were delayed if the pretreatment neutrophil count was less than 2500 cells/L or if gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 2 or higher was observed upon presentation for treatment. If administration of a chemotherapeutic drug resulted in a neutropenia or gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 3 or higher, subsequent treatments with that drug were administered at a 20% reduced dose. Antibiotics were administered if there was a neutropenia of grade 3 or higher, or if fever or other signs of infection were evident. Dogs that developed evidence of ileus or other gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 3 or higher, secondary to vincristine administration, were subsequently given vinblastine (Vinblastine

Dogs that developed sterile hemorrhagic cystitis, secondary to cyclophosphamide administration, were subsequently given chlorambucil (Leukeran; GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA) at 40 mg/m2, PO. Diagnosis of sterile hemorrhagic cystitis was based on 1 or more of the following criteria: clinical evidence of gross hematuria or stranguria, urinalysis that revealed hematuria (red blood cells [rbc]  100/high power field [hpf] 400) without evidence of bacterial cystitis or ultrasonographic demonstration of a thickened urinary bladder wall.
Assessment of response Dogs were examined prior to each chemotherapy treatment and their response assessed by lymph node measurement, physical examination, and, if applicable, assessment of organomegaly. In WHO stage V dogs, blood smears were routinely examined for the presence of circulating lymphoblasts. Bone marrow cytologic examination was not routinely repeated. Tumor mass was defined as the sum of the products of representative lesions. Response was categorized as follows: complete response (CR), defined as no evidence of gross disease; partial response (PR), defined as an equal to or greater than 50% decrease in tumor mass; no response, defined as less than 50% reduction in tumor mass or progression of disease. Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as time of onset of treatment to loss of first remission. Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from treatment onset until death.
Evaluation of prognostic factors Multiple factors were evaluated as to their prognostic significance for PFS and OS. The following factors were evaluated: body weight, age, sex, serum calcium level, WHO stage, clinical substage, immunophenotype, separation of week 1 treatment with vincristine and L-asparaginase, substitution of vincristine with vinblastine, substitution of cyclophosphamide with chlorambucil, immunophenotype, and number of treatment delays or dose reductions due to chemotherapy-associated toxicity.
Statistical methods Median PFS and OS were generated by using the product-limit method of survival function estimation (22). Hazard ratio rates (HRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (23). Assumptions of proportionality and linearity were verified for all appropriate variables. Statistical significance was defined as a P-value  0.05.
Results
Population characteristics The median age of the 39 dogs studied was 8.7 y (mean 9.3 y; range, 2.3 to 14.6 y). Twenty-six dogs were female (2 intact, 24 spayed) and 13 dogs were male (2 intact, 11 castrated). The median weight was 27.3 kg (mean 27.7 kg; range, 5.6 to 53.6 kg).

Labrador retrievers (6 dogs, 15%), mixed (6 dogs, 15%), rottweiler (3 dogs, 8%), and American cocker spaniels (3 dogs, 8%).
The diagnosis of lymphoma was based on histological examination of tissue biopsies in 25 dogs and by cytologic examination in 14 dogs. No dogs were classified as WHO stage I, 1 (3%) dog as stage II, 8 (21%) dogs as stage III, 13 (33%) dogs as stage IV, and 15 (38%) dogs as stage V. An additional 2 (5%) dogs had a cranial mediastinal mass as the solitary site of lymphoma. A 3rd dog that presented with multicentric lymphoma (WHO stage IV) also had cranial mediastinal involvement. Bone marrow aspirates were drawn on 38 dogs. Fourteen (36%) of the 38 dogs showed evidence of lymphoma involvement on bone marrow cytologic examination. Of the 15 dogs with stage V lymphoma, 8 (53%) had blood and bone marrow involvement, 6 (40%) had bone marrow involvement without evidence of peripheral blood involvement, and 1 (7%) had blood involvement without evidence of bone marrow involvement.
Nineteen (49%) dogs were classified as substage a (Table 1) and 20 (51%) dogs as substage b. Clinical signs of illness at diagnosis included lethargy and gastroenteritis, exhibited by inappetance, vomiting, or diarrhea. Duration of clinical signs prior to treatment ranged from 1 to 90 d with a median duration of 8.5 d. Duration of clinical signs could not be determined in 3 dogs due to chronicity of signs. Two (5%) dogs received prednisone therapy for 2 wk or less prior to starting the protocol.
Immunophenotyping was performed on 30 tumors. In 23 dogs, immunophenotyping was performed on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. In the other 7 dogs, immunophenotyping was performed on cytologic

preparations. Twenty-five dogs (83%) had B-cell lymphoma. Five (17%) dogs had T-cell lymphoma.
Three dogs (7.7%) were hypercalcemic on presentation. Two of these dogs presented with a cranial mediastinal mass. Both of these dogs had T-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotype was not determined in the 3rd dog.
Response to therapy Thirty-eight (97%) of 39 dogs obtained a CR. The remaining dog obtained a PR, resulting in overall response rate of 100%. The median PFS was 331 d. The median OS was 461 d. At the time of analysis, 23 dogs had lost the 1st remission, 19 were still alive. Of the 20 dogs that had died, 17 had died or were euthanized due to lymphoma. Three dogs died or were euthanized while in CR due to causes other than lymphoma: 1 dog died of thyroid carcinoma with metastasis to the liver at 357 d; another was euthanized at day 266 upon diagnosis of an oral squamous cell carcinoma; and the 3rd dog was euthanized at 490 d due to progressive orthopedic disease.
Prognostic factors Of the factors evaluated for prognostic significance, only immunophenotype and sex were found to have statistically significant prognostic value (Table 4). Immunophenotype was prognostic for both PFS and OS. Dogs with B-cell lymphoma had a significantly longer median PFS (354 d) than dogs with T-cell lymphoma (median PFS = 94 d). Dogs with B-cell lymphoma had a signifi-

cantly longer median OS (559 d) than dogs with T-cell lymphoma (median OS = 239 d).
Sex was also found to have statistically significant prognostic value for both PFS and OS. Castrated male dogs had a significantly shorter PFS (126 d) than female spayed dogs (420 d). Male castrated dogs had a significantly shorter median OS (239 d) than female spayed dogs (median OS  601 d).
Whether a dog experienced a treatment delay or a reduction in dose did not affect PFS or OS. Substitution of vincristine with vinblastine and substitution of cyclophosphamide with chlorambucil did not significantly affect treatment response. Although there was some evidence for an increased PFS and OS for dogs that received vinblastine, the study had insufficient power to find this evidence convincing.
Toxicity Thirty-seven (95%) dogs experienced neutropenic episodes or gastrointestinal toxicity during therapy. These dogs had 94 episodes of gastrointestinal toxicity and 53 episodes of neutropenia. Neutropenia was reported as follows: grade 1, 30 (57%) episodes; grade 2, 14 (26%) episodes; grade 3, 6 (11%) episodes; and grade 4, 3 (6%) episodes. Gastrointestinal toxicity episodes were reported as follows: grade 1, 35 (37%) episodes; grade 2, 38 (41%) episodes; grade 3, 16 (17%) episodes; and grade 4, 5 (5%) episodes. Three dogs were hospitalized for gastrointestinal toxicity. No dog died or was euthanized as a result of drug toxicity.

Twenty-five (64%) dogs required 1 or more delays in treatment or dose reductions at some point in the protocol. These dogs had a total of 37 treatment delays and 16 dose reductions. The majority of treatment delays occurred during the induction period (34 treatment delays, 10 dose reductions). During the maintenance phase, there were 3 treatment delays and 6 dose reductions. Fourteen dogs (36%) had no delays in treatment or dose reductions.
Vincristine administration was associated with the highest number of treatment delays and dose reductions (18 and 5, respectively). Neutropenia following vincristine administration was the cause of 16 treatment delays and 5 dose reductions. The median grade of neutropenia was 1 (range 1 to 3) Table 3. There were 2 treatment delays due to gastrointestinal toxicity following vincristine administration. Vincristine was also associated with the highest number of episodes of neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity. There were 29 episodes of neutropenia: 15 (52%) grade 1, 9 (31%) grade 2, 3 (10%) grade 3, and 2 (7%) grade 4. There were 37 episodes of gastrointestinal toxicity: 16 (43%) grade 1, 11 (30%) grade 2, 6 (16%) grade 3, and 4 (11%) grade 4. Three dogs were hospitalized due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Thirteen (33%) dogs had vinblastine substituted for vincristine due to clinical signs of ileus or other gastrointestinal toxicity. Vinblastine administration was associated with 1 treatment delay due to neutropenia of grade 3.
Twenty-f ive (64%) dogs received concurrent L-asparaginase and vincristine at week 1. Concurrent administration of L-asparaginase and vincristine resulted in 6 treatment delays due to neutropenia of grade 1 or higher. Rather than delaying treatment at week 2, 3 dogs with grade 1 neutropenia received cyclophosphamide at a 20% reduced dose. In 14 (36%) dogs, week 1 L-asparaginase and vincristine were separated by up to 2 to 7 d. The reasons for separation of L-asparaginase and vincristine administration were as follows: high tumor burden (stage IV or V) in 12 dogs; clinical signs of illness at first treatment in 13 dogs; and thrombocytopenia (5000 cells/L) in 1 dog. Four dogs had week 2 treatment delayed due to neutropenia of grade 1 or higher in spite of having L-asparaginase and vincristine administration separated by up to 7 d.
Doxorubicin administration resulted in 1 treatment delay due a neutropenia of grade 1 and 7 dose reductions (1 due to gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 2; 6 due to neutropenia of grade 1 or higher).
No dog experienced a treatment delay or dose reduction following actinomycin-D administration.
Cyclophosphamide administration resulted in 7 treatment delays (1 due to gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 2; 6 due to neutropenia of grade 1 or higher) and 1 dose reduction due to gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 3. Six dogs developed evidence of sterile hemorrhagic cystitis following a median of 2.5 treatments with cyclophosphamide (range 1 to 3 treatments). Dogs were diagnosed as follows: Clinical evidence of gross hematuria or stranguria 6 dogs; hematuria with no evidence of infection on urinalysis 3 dogs; and ultrasonographic demonstration of a thickened urinary bladder 3 dogs. All 6 dogs subsequently received chlorambucil in place of cyclophos-

phamide. No dog experienced a treatment delay or dose reduction following chlorambucil administration.
Discussion
A higher prevalence of lymphoma in female dogs has been reported previously (24). However, other studies found that intact female dogs were at decreased risk for lymphoma (3,7,25). A number of previous studies have not identified sex as a risk factor for canine lymphoma (26­28). In the current study, the female to male ratio was 2:1. Only 2 (7.7%) of the 26 female dogs were intact. Whether or not this represents a true difference in risk based on sex is undetermined, as a comparison with the hospital population was not made.
The higher proportion of advanced staged dogs in this report may not be due to an actual difference in the populations studied but, instead, to the use of more sensitive staging techniques compared with some previous studies. Abdominal ultrasonographs and bone marrow aspirates were not routinely performed in some studies in which lower numbers of dogs with stage IV and stage V disease were reported (11­13). Other studies that routinely utilized diagnostic methods such as abdominal ultrasonography and bone marrow examination have indicated a higher percentage of stage IV and stage V dogs (15,17). Abdominal ultrasonographs have been shown to be more sensitive in the identification of splenic involvement than have physical examinations or abdominal radiographs (29). Previous studies have demonstrated increased sensitivity of bone marrow examination over blood smear examination alone in identifying WHO stage V dogs (15,17). The current study gives further evidence that studies not utilizing bone marrow examination are likely to underestimate the percentage of WHO stage V dogs.
The complete response rate was higher with this study's protocol than with other previously reported protocols (4,7,9). The median PFS survival and OS were also more favorable compared with previous studies. The current study results occurred in a population with a relatively higher percentage of dogs with advanced WHO stage (stage IV or V) and clinical substage b than in previous reports (7,9). Although not found to be prognostic in the current study, stage and substage have been identified as prognostic factors in some previous studies (7,19,30,31).
The current chemotherapy protocol varied from previous studies by including actinomycin-D as part of the maintenance therapy. Actinomycin-D is an antitumor antibiotic with a mechanism of action similar to that of doxorubicin (32). Unlike doxorubicin, actinomycin-D is relatively inexpensive and has not been associated with cardiac toxicoses (32). In a study comparing doxorubicin with actinomycin-D in a multiagent protocol for the treatment of dogs with lymphoma, dogs receiving doxorubicin had significantly longer remission and survival times than did dogs receiving actinomycin-D (33). The efficacy of actinomycin-D as a single agent in the treatment of dogs with lymphoma has received limited evaluation. One study utilizing actinomycin-D as a single agent has shown efficacy in treating canine lymphoma (34). In that study, dogs obtaining a PR or CR included

56 Can Vet J Volume 47, January 2006

previously untreated dogs (3 of 3 dogs) and dogs that had relapsed after prior chemotherapy with various agents, including doxorubicin (7 of 9 dogs), for an overall response rate of 83%. In another study utilizing actinomycin-D as a rescue agent for 25 dogs with relapsed lymphoma, no dog showed a response (35). In that study, 24 of the 25 dogs had received previous doxorubicin. To our knowledge the value of including actinomycin-D in a doxorubicin containing combination protocol has not previously been evaluated.
Several studies have examined the importance of extended maintenance chemotherapy in achieving durable PFS and OS. Chun et al (4) investigated a 25-week high-dose chemotherapy protocol. The reported median remission duration of 300 d and median survival of 270 d were similar to those reported with doxorubicinbased multidrug protocols with a less intensive induction followed by an extended maintenance period (9). This latter protocol was, however, associated with frequent and often severe toxicity. Garrett et al (18) also investigated a 25-week combination chemotherapy protocol for canine lymphoma where the reported median remission duration of 282 d and median survival of 397 d were similar to those reported with a similar doxorubicin containing combination chemotherapy protocol that included a prolonged maintenance phase (9). The value of extended maintenance remains unclear. In human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, maintenance therapy with non-cross-resistant chemotherapy agents to achieve longterm disease-free survival rates has been unsuccessful; thus, most chemotherapy protocols for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in humans do not include a maintenance phase (36). However, while the cure rate for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in humans is relatively high, it remains low in dogs. This key difference in treatment response may make maintenance therapy more valuable in the treatment of canine lymphoma. Considering the cost and time involved with long-term protocols, prospective studies comparing extended maintenance protocols verses shorter-term protocols should be instigated.
Numerous studies have reported prognostic factors relating to response rate, and PFS and OS time. Results from these studies have been variable and conflicting. Factors identified to be prognostic in previous reports include age, sex, weight, hypercalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, clinical stage, clinical substage, histologic classification, proliferation indices, and immunophenotype (20).
The prognostic value of clinical stage remains controversial. One study found that dogs with less extensive disease (WHO stage I to III) were more likely to achieve a complete remission (37). In other studies, there were no differences in remission rate, but the remission and survival duration were higher for dogs with WHO stage I-III lymphoma (19,30,38). While many studies have found stage to be prognostic for both disease-free interval and survival (11,30,37,39), others have failed to demonstrate prognostic significance regarding stage (6,14). The determination of prognostic significance of stage, as in determining the prevalence of each stage, is complicated by the fact that diagnostic tests to determine stage have varied across different studies (11,14,30).The current study gives further evidence that treatment of

dogs with higher stages of lymphoma should not be discouraged.
Substage has been reported as a "strongly accepted" prognostic factor for dogs with lymphoma (40). Dogs presenting with substage b disease have been reported to have a lower response rate (11,37), PFS, and OS (5,7,9,31). The current study was similar to other studies that have failed to show a correlation between substage and response to therapy (21,41).
Hypercalcemia has been identified as a negative prognostic factor for survival (5,42). A number of studies, including the current study, found no prognostic significance associated with hypercalcemia (6,7,10,39). Hypercalcemia has been associated with T-cell phenotype (16,31), presence of a cranial mediastinal mass (41,43,44), substage b, and a higher probability of concurrent renal failure (43­45). These concurrent factors may account for the shorter survival times associated with hypercalcemia. The percentage of hypercalcemic dogs was lower than reported in previous studies and may have affected our ability to assess its prognostic significance (2,7).
Prednisone administration prior to initiation of combination chemotherapy has been identified as a negative prognostic factor (39). In the current study, prior prednisone administration could not be evaluated for prognostic value, because of the small number of prednisonetreated dogs. The small number of dogs receiving prior prednisone therapy may have favorably impacted the current study results.
The distribution of dogs with T-cell versus B-cell lymphoma was similar to that in previously reported studies (16,46). All previous studies found T-cell type to be associated with shorter remission duration and survival times (3,16,31,47). The current study further supports immunophenotype as one of the most consistently identified prognostic factors for canine lymphoma.
There have been conflicting reports concerning sex as a prognostic variable. In the current study, castrated males showed a shorter PFS survival and OS than did spayed female dogs. This contrasts with a previous report in which castrated males had the longer remission duration (48). Other studies have shown female dogs to have increased remission duration (14) and survival times (3,7,14,49,50). A number of studies have reported no prognostic significance with regards to sex (6,16,19,21, 30,31,41,51).
Although previously reported to be less efficacious than vincristine in the treatment of canine lymphoma, vinblastine has received limited evaluation as a single agent or as part of a combination chemotherapy protocol (38,52). Based on the current study results, further evaluation into the efficacy of vinblastine, whether as a substitute for vincristine or as a first line agent, in the treatment of canine lymphoma should be considered.
Although most dogs experienced 1 or more episodes of neutropenia or gastrointestinal toxicity, the majority of these toxicities were mild (neutropenia of grade 1; gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 1 or 2) and self-limiting. Although toxicity associated with the simultaneous administration of vincristine and L-asparaginase has been well documented (53), vincristine as a single agent is not considered a highly toxic drug and has been reported to

result in minimal myelosuppresion (54). Alleman et al (55) found no evidence of myeloid cell destruction on examination of bone marrow of clinically normal dogs given a therapeutic dose of vincristine. Other studies have demonstrated a high prevalence and severity of toxicity associated with vincristine administration (4,18). Chun et al (4) reported a high prevalence of toxicity associated with vincristine administration in dogs that received single agent vincristine at a dose of 0.7 mg/m2 as part of a combination chemotherapy protocol. In that study, 10 of 49 (20%) dogs treated required a treatment delay and 5 dogs died after receiving single agent vincristine. The reason for the high prevalence and severity of neutropenia following vincristine administration in this and other studies remains unclear. These findings warrant further investigation into the cause of vincristine-induced neutropenia and concern when administering vincristine as part of a combination chemotherapy protocol.
Although actinomycin-D has been reported to have minimal hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity (56), some studies have reported dose-limiting episodes of neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity when actinomycin-D was used as a single agent or as part of a sequential combination chemotherapy protocol (33,34). In the current study, no dogs experienced a treatment delay or dose reduction following actinomycin-D administration.
Considering the time and financial requirement associated in treating dogs with lymphoma, it is important to provide clinicians and owners with the best information possible regarding prognostic factors and the risks and benefits of various chemotherapy protocols. The sequential combination chemotherapy protocol used in this study was highly effective for the treatment of canine lymphoma. While these results are promising, this was a retrospective study and a limited number of dogs were evaluated. Comparisons to previous studies (use of historical controls) were limited by such factors as differences in diagnostic and staging procedures, secondary treatments, methods of evaluation, and follow-up. In regards to providing owners with information regarding prognostic factors, results remain conflicting. Possible reasons for discrepancy between studies evaluating prognostic factors include the relatively small number of dogs in each study, variations in treatment protocols, difference in staging diagnostic tests, insufficient data, and the use of univariate instead of multivariate statistical methods. The value of long-term maintenance remains unclear and its use is one of the most pressing questions faced by clinicians treating dogs with lymphoma. Clinical trials comparing long-term maintenance protocols with shorter-term protocols, in addition to the inclusion of various agents, including actinomycin-D, should be conducted in a prospective, randomized manner in order to determine their value in treating dogs with lymphoma. Although overall toxicity was found to be acceptable, the prevalence and severity of vincristine-associated toxicity gives warning to clinicians who have traditionally considered this drug to be of minimum risk to patients.
