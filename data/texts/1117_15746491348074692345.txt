What is GenBank? 
•  GenBank is the NIH genetic sequence 

database of all publicly available DNA and 
derived protein sequences, with 
annotations describing the biological 
information these records contain.

Scoring Matrices 
•  Empirical weighting scheme to represent biology 

comparison 

–  Implicitly represent a particular theory of evolution 
–  Choice of matrix can strongly influence outcomes 

–  Cys/Pro important for structure and function  
–  Trp has bulky side chain 
–  Lys/Arg have positively-charged side chains  

•  Importance of understanding scoring matrices 

–  Appear in all analyses involving sequence 

Matrix Structure 

4/16/12 

11 

PAM Matrices 
•  Margaret Dayhoff, 1978 
•  Point Accepted Mutation (PAM) 

–  Look at patterns of substitutions in related proteins 
–  The new side chain must function the same way as 

the old one (“acceptance”) 

–  On average, 1 PAM corresponds to 1 amino acid 

change per 100 residues 
–  1 PAM ~ 1% divergence 
–  Extrapolate to predict patterns at longer distances 

PAM Matrices 
•  Assumptions 

–  Replacement is independent of surrounding residues 
–  Sequences being compared are of average 

composition 

–  All sites are equally mutable 

•  Sources of error 

–  Small, globular proteins used to derive matrices 

(departure from average composition)  

–  Errors in PAM 1 are magnified up to PAM 250 
–  Does not account for conserved blocks or motifs 

4/16/12 

12 

–  Look only for differences in conserved, ungapped 

regions of a protein family  

BLOSUM Matrices 
•  Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992 
•  Blocks Substitution Matrix (BLOSUM)  

–  More sensitive to structural or functional substitutions 
–  BLOSUM n 

•  Contribution of sequences > n% identical weighted to 1  
•  Substitution frequencies are more heavily-influenced by 

sequences that are more divergent than this cutoff 

•  Clustering reduces contribution of closely-related sequences 
•  Reducing n yields more distantly-related sequences 

So many matrices... 
•  Triple-PAM strategy (Altschul, 1991) 
–  PAM 40 Short alignments, highly similar 
–  PAM 120 
–  PAM 250 Longer, weaker local alignments 

•  BLOSUM (Henikoff, 1993) 

–  BLOSUM 90 Short alignments, highly similar  
–  BLOSUM 62 Most effective in detecting known 
–  BLOSUM 30 Longer, weaker local alignments  

members of a protein family  

•  No single matrix is the complete answer for all 

sequence comparisons

Some lessons learned by bioinformaticians – 

sometimes, the hard way 

4/16/12 

30 

(cid:108)Short Motif Pitfall(cid:122) 
•  The level of sequence identity required for 

significant homology is much higher for smaller 
regions 

•  Two proteins may share a common domain 

while still being dissimilar elsewhere 

•  For very short motifs, homology cannot be 

inferred by sequence identity  

 
short motifs may not be helpful in describing what a 
protein does

Does structural similarity imply common function?  

 

It depends.  

Predicting Function: Considerations 

•  Assure that the database hits and predictive 

methods based on sequence yield information 
that make biological sense 
–  Predicted motifs or features biologically correct 
–  Consistency with findings at the bench 

•  Even if one is able to predict function, the 

prediction can indeed turn out to be incorrect 
– experimental proof is absolutely essential!
