HS Joshi 1, MC Joshi 2, Arun Singh3, Preeti Joshi 4, Nadeem Israr Khan5
ABSTRACT
Background: Nutritional status of children is an indicator of nutritional profile of entire community. It is a major public health problem and accounts for about half of all child deaths worldwide. Objectives: To study the prevalence of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and its various determinants in children 0 -6 years in rural community. Method: A cross-sectional study done by conducting house to house survey, 449 children (0-6 years) covered from the sub centre villages of additional Primary Health Center (PHC) of Rithora, District Bareilly. Result: The overall occurrence of PEM in under 6 years children was observed to be 49.44%, however it was found to be significantly higher (64.87%) in the age group of 3-6 years as compare to other age group. The proportion of grade I, II, III and IV of under nutrition observed was 45.49%, 38.30%, 14.86 and 1.35% respectively. Prevalence of underweight was significantly higher in children belonging to nuclear families and in children of illiterate mothers. . There was direct association of underweight in relation to caste, poor housing and environmental sanitations and low standard of living index. Conclusion: The occurrence of PEM is more in children of 3-6 age group specially in females, which may be due to lack of attention to this age group in rural areas.
Key Words: Under nutrition, malnutrition, nutritional correlates, nutritional status, PEM.
INTRODUCTION
Malnutrition continues to be a primary cause of ill health and mortality among children in developing countries. It is a major public health problem and accounts for about half of all child deaths worldwide1. About 150 million children in developing countries are still malnourished and more than half of underweight children live in South East Asia Region (SEAR) 1. The high levels of under nutrition in children in South Asia pose a major challenge for child survival and development. Besides poverty, there are other factors that directly or indirectly affect the nutritional status of children. Several studies showed that maternal education emerges as a key element of an overall strategy to address malnutrition 3 .The best global indicator of children's well being is growth. Poor growth is attributable to a range of factors closely linked to overall standards of living and the ability of populations to meet their basic needs, such as access to food, housing and health care. Assessment of growth is the single measurement that best defines the nutritional and health status of children, and provides an indirect measurement of the quality of life of the entire population. __________________________ 1.

Determinants of protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in 0-6 years children in rural community

Despite improvements in some measures, poor nutrition is still a serious problem, especially in Uttar Pradesh, among children from low socioeconomic groups. The present study was conducted with the objectives of : -
1. To find out the PEM prevalence among 0-6 years age group 2. To identify the different factors which affect the prevalence of PEM among rural population of Bareilly district.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The present study was conducted among children (0-6 year) in all the six sub center villages of randomly selected additional primary health center of Rithora, district Bareilly, India, during the period of August 2007 to July 2008, which is the Rural Field Practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, Rohilkhand Medical College and Hospital, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used for selection of villages. An optimum sample size for study was obtained by an estimated PEM prevalence of 50% in children 0 -6 years age group with 10% relative precision and 95% confidence interval, the minimum sample size calculated out was 384 children. A total of 449 children (0-6 years) were covered by house to house visit. Detailed information was collected on a predesigned and pretested questionnaire and supplemented by physical and anthropometric examination of child. The grading of PEM was done as per the recommendations of Nutrition Sub-Committee of Paediatrics (ICMR 1972).

Statistical Analysis: Data were entered and analyzed using statistical software SPSS 10.0 for windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Chi-square test was used for testing the significance of association between the socioeconomic characteristics and malnutrition.

RESULTS

The overall prevalence of PEM was 222 (49.44%) out of total 449 children of age group 0-6 years surveyed. The prevalence of underweight in children 3-6 years (64.87%) was significantly higher than other age group, followed by 21.62% in age group of 1-3 years. Out of total 449 children 248 (55.23%) were males and 201(44.77%) were females and prevalence of under nutrition was observed 39.92 %( 99 out of 248) in males and 61.19% (123 out of 201) in females. Significant difference observed between prevalence of PEM and sex - Table-1.

Determinants of protein energy malnutrition (PEM) in 0-6 years children in rural community

Significant association was observed between prevalence of underweight and different factors like type of family, caste, Standard of Living Index (SLI), Housing, environmental sanitation and literacy with 2 value and p value 2 =29.52, p=0.000001, 2 =48.68, p=0.000001, 2 =62.85 p=0.0000001, 2 =48.46, p=0.000001 and 2 =11.06, p=0.00088 respectively
(Table-3).

DISCUSSION

In present study prevalence of PEM and its relation to various epidemiological factors was assessed in 449 children on the basis of weight for age. Out of total 449, 21.4% of children were in 0-1 year's age group, 20.94% were in 1-3 years age group and 57.68% were in 3-6 years age group. 55.23% were males and 44.77% were females.

The overall prevalence of underweight was 49.44%. The difference in prevalence of underweight in relation to age and sex was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Chakraborty et al (2006) in rural Jhansi reported overall prevalence of underweight in 0-6 years age group as 67% and reported same significant difference in prevalence of underweight in relation to age and sex, as present study other studies including NFHS II (1998-99) reported PEM more prevalent in female as compare to males specially in rural areas, this may be due to more concern for male child1, 3, 7. But Dwivedi et al4 in their study in urban slum found more males affected with lower grades of under nutrition than females.

Early malnutrition among rural children as compared to urban children may be attributed to the better parental care given to the urban children. A comparatively higher prevalence of underweight (60.0%) was reported by Vijayaraghavan et al (1998)5 . In present study prevalence of PEM observed more in 3-6 years age group (64.87%) as compare to other studies Chakraborty et al (2006)3 and Swami et al (2001)6 who observed malnutrition was more prevalent in the younger age group, i.e. 3 years(80.9% and 71% respectively). In NFHS III (2005-06)2 done in children <3 years of age prevalence of underweight
was 43.7% in rural population of Uttar Pradesh. The prevalence of PEM being significantly higher (p < 0.00001) in the nuclear family (50.9%) in comparison to joint family (49.1%), may be due to the reason that children in the joint family are nutritionally better cared as there is tendency to share the food with the children by all the family members.

In the present study, the proportion of children with grade I, II, III and IV PEM were 45.49%, 38.30%, 14.86% and 1.35% respectively, where as 29.0%, 25.5%, 9% and 3.5% reported by Chakraborty et al3. Mild, moderate and severe grades of malnutrition reported by other workers are as follows: Srivastav et al (1979)8 29.5%, 10.6% and 2.9%; Kakkar et al (1987)9 38%, 31% and 9%. In National Family Health Survey II (NFHS II) (1998-99)1 value for, moderate and severe grades of
malnutrition according to underweight were 47.0% and 18.0% respectively with corresponding figures for U.P. being 51.7%
and 21.9% respectively. In present study severe grades (III and IV) observed more in females (54.55% and 66.67%) as compare to males which were higher than as observed by Chakraborty et al3 who observed only 7.3% and 2.7% respectively.

In present study PEM was reported significantly higher (p<0.0001) in lower caste (70.72%) as compare to upper caste (29.28%), similar findings were given by NFHS II (1998-99).1 In the present study PEM was inversely associated with standard of living index with prevalence of 45.94% in children of low standard of living index (p<0.00001) as also observed in NFHS II (1998-99)1 both at national level and Uttar Pradesh level. A similar finding of malnutrition being more prevalent in children belonging to lower socioeconomic groups was also found by , Rao et al (1990)10 and Jayaseelan et al (1997)11. The reason for malnutrition being more prevalent among lower socioeconomic groups may be due to their lower purchasable capacity for food and unavailability of hygienic and healthy living environment among them.

The prevalence of underweight in the present study was higher in children of illiterate mother's (65.32%) as

compared to children of literate mother's (34.68%). Similar results that prevalence of malnutrition decreased with increasing

parental literacy was found by NFHS II (1998-99)1, Chakraborty et al3, Arya et al (1991)12, Harishanker et al (2004)13 and

Bishnoi et al (2004)14 . In the present study it was found that prevalence of PEM higher (39.19% and 56.76%) when housing and environmental sanitation conditions were poor and satisfactory while only 04.05% when environmental and sanitary conditions were good (p<0.0001) which is comparable with finding Bishnoi et al (2004)14.
CONCLUSION
The present study shows that the prevalence of underweight was significantly higher in children of 3-6 years of age, sex, caste, nuclear family, low standard of living index, mother's illiteracy and poor housing and environmental sanitation. Female child had a higher occurrence of overall and grade III and IV PEM. This may be because of the lack of attention that a girl child receives. The PEM is higher in illiterate mothers because of lack of awareness among them. The extent of malnutrition can be countered by educating the parents with respect to basic nutritional requirements of their children and encouraging them to consume locally available low cost foods.
The study suggests intensification of ICDS with multi sectorial strengthing will also help a they help in taking care of the child and educating the child along with providing meals which compliment the child's diet, thus improving their nutritional status.
