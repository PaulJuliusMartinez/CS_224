Background: In male rodents, anogenital distance (AGD) provides a sensitive and continuous correlate of androgen exposure in the intrauterine environment and predicts later reproductive success. Some endocrine-disrupting chemicals can alter male reproductive tract development, including shortening AGD, in both rodents and humans. Whether AGD is related to semen quality in human is unknown. Objective: We examined associations between AGD and semen parameters in adult males. Methods: We used multiple regression analyses to model the relationships between sperm parameters and two alternative measures of AGD [from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (AGDAS) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (AGDAP)] in 126 volunteers in Rochester, New York. Results: AGDAS, but not AGDAP, was associated with sperm concentration, motility, morphology, total sperm count, and total motile count (p-values, 0.002­0.048). Men with AGDAS below (vs. above) the median were 7.3 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 2.5­21.6) to have a low sperm concentration (< 20 × 106/mL). For a typical study participant, sperm concentrations were 34.7 × 106/mL and 51.6 × 106/mL at the 25th and 75th percentiles of (adjusted) AGDAS. Conclusions: In our population, AGDAS was a strong correlate of all semen parameters and a predictor of low sperm concentration. In animals, male AGD at birth reflects androgen levels during the masculinization programming window and predicts adult AGD and reproductive function. Our results suggest, therefore, that the androgenic environment during early fetal life exerts a fundamental influence on both AGD and adult sperm counts in humans, as demonstrated in rodents. Key words: anogenital distance, antia ndrogens, endocrine disruption, semen quality, testicular dysgenesis. Environ Health Perspect 119:958­963 (2011). doi:10.1289/ehp.1103421 [Online 4 March 2011]

A wide range of environmental chemicals can interfere with androgen production and signaling and have been shown to alter the development of the male reproductive tract in experimental animals (Foster 2006; Gray et al. 2006). Establishing links between anti androgenic exposure in utero and similar outcomes in humans is challenging, however, in part because the genital anomalies traditionally examined in humans (e.g., hypospadias) occur with such a low incidence that studying them requires very large populations. Thus, a more sensitive (and continuous) measu re of the developmental androgenic milieu is desirable.
Anogenital distance (AGD; distance from anus to genitals) may serve as such a measu re. AGD is routinely used in animal toxicology studies and is the developmental end point most sensitive to antiandrogenic exposure. In rodents and other mammals, AGD has been shown to reflect the amount of androgen to which a male fetus is exposed in early development; higher in utero androgen exposure results in longer and more masculine AGD. Recent interest in reproductive effects of anti androgens has focused on the phthalates, particularly diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), whose anti androgenic effects have been directly demon

strated in rodent models (Gray et al. 2006; Scott et al. 2008). We previously reported strong inverse associations between prenatal phthalate exposure (particularly DEHP and DBP) and shorter male AGD in human infants (Swan 2008; Swan et al. 2005).
In many rodent studies, shortened AGD is seen in conjunction with frank defects such as hypospadias and cryptorchidism, and shorter AGD has been seen in conjunction with hypospadias in human males (Hsieh et al. 2008). Moreover, in male rodents, shortened (weight-adjusted) AGD persists into adulthood (Hotchkiss et al. 2004) and predicts compromised reproductive function in the mature male (Macleod et al. 2010; Scott et al. 2008). However, to our knowledge, no study has examined associations between AGD in adults and sperm number or quality.
Definitively demonstrating that AGD provides a link between prenatal antia ndrogen exposure and adult reproductive function in humans would require the availability of biological samples reflecting prenatal exposure and subsequent follow-up across the many years between exposure and sexual maturation. However, associations between AGD and adult reproductive function in humans would provide indirect evidence.

In this study, we explored the hypothesis that AGD may be a predictor of semen quality in adult humans. If confirmed, this biomarker may provide information about the androgenic hormonal milieu during fetal development and may be useful in studies of reproductive development and function in adulthood.
Materials and Methods
Study population. Subjects were participants in the Rochester Young Men's Study (RYMS), a cross-sectional study of young men conducted in 2009­2010 at the University of Rochester (Rochester, NY). RYMS is part of an international study funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Program (Environment), "Developmental Effects of Environment on Reproductive Health" (DEER). Men were recruited into RYMS through flyers and newspapers at college and university campuses in the Rochester area. Subjects were eligible if they were born in the United States after 31 December 1987, able to read and speak English, and able to contact their mother and ask her to complete a questionnaire. In response to advertisements placed at local colleges, a total of 389 potential participants contacted our study coordinator between spring 2009 and spring 2010. Of these, 305 (78.4%) met all eligibility criteria, and 222 men participated in the study. AGD measurements were obtained only for men who enrolled September 2009 and later. One man with a history of testicular cancer was azospermic (sperm count of 0) and was not included in analysis. Motility data were excluded for one man whose time to semen analysis exceeded 30 min.

Anogenital distance and semen quality

126 men with complete data on all study outcomes and covariates, including both meas ures of AGD, except sperm morphology data, which was available for only 124 men.
The study included a physical examination; blood, urine, and semen samples; and completion of a brief questionnaire. Subjects received $75 upon completion of all study components. Data from the mother's questionnaire were not considered in this analysis. The University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before their participation.
Semen collection and analysis. Men collected semen samples by masturbation at the clinic and were asked to report the time of their previous ejaculation. Although they were asked to abstain from ejaculation for at least 48 hr before sample collection, they were not excluded if they had not. Abstinence times reported to be > 240 hr (n = 3) were truncated at 240 hr. Sample processing was initiated within 30 min of collection. Ejaculate volumes were estimated by specimen weight, assuming a semen density of 1.0 g/mL. Sperm concentration was evaluated by hemocytometer (Improved Neubauer; Hauser Scientific Inc., Horsham, PA, USA). Two chambers of the hemocytometer were counted, and the average was used in this analysis. Motility was analyzed using World Health Organization (WHO 1999) criteria; the percentage of all sperm that were classified as forward motile ("A + B," where highly or moderately progressive sperm are scored as "A" and slow or sluggish progressive sperm are scored as "B") were used in all analyses and considered motile in this analysis. We also calculated the total sperm count (volume × sperm concentration) and the total motile count (volume × sperm concentration × percent motile). Smears for morphology were made, air-dried, fixed, and shipped to the University Department of Growth and Reproduction at the Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark). The slides were Papanicolaou stained and assessed using strict criteria (Menkveld et al. 1990). To increase consistency and comparability of methods over the course of the study, six sets of duplicate semen samples were sent during the study from the University of Copenhagen's Department of Growth and Reproduction to the Andrology Laboratory (University of Rochester), which is Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified.
Physical examination. A physical examination of each participant was performed, and weight and height assessed, on the same day as semen, urine, and blood sampling. The presence of varicocele or other abnormalities were noted, and testicular size was estimated using Prader's orchidometer (Andrology Australia, Clayton, Victoria, Australia).

In this study we measured two variants

of AGD: The first was measured from the

and made while the man was in the lithotomy

position, with his thighs at a 45° angle to the

examination table. To improve precision, the

examiner made each of these measurements

twice, and the mean of the two measurements

(within-observer mean) was used as the esti-

mate. (More detailed instructions for con-

ducting this exam and an anatomically correct

figure demonstrating landmarks are available

upon request.)

A single examiner (J.M.) conducted most

of the exams (94%), and a second (J. Stevens)

examined the remaining seven men. Both

examiners independently examined eight

of these men in three sessions conducted

throughout the collection period. Neither the

examiners nor the support staff had knowl-

edge of the men's semen quality.

Statistical analyses. Sperm concentration,

total sperm count, and total motile count

were logarithmically transformed to normalize

their distributions. We examined possible drift

in measurements by including exam date in

multivariate analyses both as a continuous and

as a categorical variable. We assessed within-

observer variability in the AGD measurements

by calculating the mean absolute difference

in measurements. We used multiple regres-

sion analyses to identify predictors of each of

the two AGD measurements. We then deter-

mined the relative importance of these pre-

dictors by examining the partial correlations

between the measurement and the predictor,

controlling for other variables in the model.

We also used multiple regression analyses to

examine associations between AGD measure-

ments and each semen parameter. Covariates

initially examined, both as predictors of AGD

measurements and as predictors of semen

parameters, were ethnicity, height, body mass

index (BMI), examiner, smoking status (cur-

rent smoker vs. not current smoker), exam

date, testicular volume, and presence of tes-

ticular abnormalities (varicocele and hydro

cele). We also initially included a variable

reflecting the number of stressful life events

(Dohrenwend et al. 1978), previously shown

to be significantly related to sperm count

and motility (Gollenberg et al. 2010). When

inclusion of a potential covariate resulted in

a change in the coefficient of < 10%, the

variable was not retained in final models. The

exception was recruitment period, which was

retained even though it had little effect on the

regression coefficients for all sperm parameters. In addition, abstinence time was entered into all models predicting sperm concentration, volume, total sperm count, and total motile count, and time from sample collection to sample analysis was included in models predicting sperm motility and total motile count, because these variables are commonly controlled in andrology research. In addition, we examined AGD in relation to the likelihood that a man's sperm concentration fell below 20 × 106/mL (WHO 1999) using logistic regression and controlling for the same covariates. Final models are described in "Results." Level of statistical significance was set at 0.05. Once models were determined, two analysts (J.M. and F.L.) conducted these analyses independently using SAS (version 8; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SPSS (version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
The RYMS study population was quite homogeneous. Participants were 18­22 years of age (median age, 19.4 years), predominantly Caucasian (81%), nonsmokers (73%), with a median BMI of 24.2. Median sperm concentration was 53.5 × 106/mL, and median total sperm count was 157 × 106. Demographic and reproductive parameters are summarized in Table 1. Although this was a population of apparently healthy young men, 24.6% of them had a sperm count < 20 × 106/mL, a commonly used cutoff for subfertility (WHO 1999).

that is 40.2% of the median, based on the best-fitting model. Similar increases are seen for other sperm parameters, although a smaller increase is seen for percent morphologically normal sperm.
Height, BMI, and time period were all associated with AGD and included in the final models, although none of these variables was associated with any semen parameter in this population. All sperm parameters were significantly lower in the small subgroup (n = 7) of African-American men compared with other men in this population (pvalues for sperm parameters, < 0.001 to 0.016).

Discussion

This is the first study to measure AGD in adult

men and examine the relationships between

AGD measures and sperm parameters. We

observed significant positive associations

between AGDAS and sperm concentration, motility, morphology, total sperm count,

and total motile count. The associations we

observed between these sperm parameters

and AGD were stronger than those for most

covariates known to be associated with semen

quality. For example, the increase in sperm

concentration associated with an interquartile

increase expected

as to

large as that be associated

with an interquartile increase in abstinence

time (8.4 × 106/mL), a known strong pre-

dictor of sperm concentration. Moreover, a

man with an AGDAS below the median was 7.3 times as likely to have a sperm concentra-

tion in the subfertile range (< 20 × 106/mL) as

aunmdaenrswcoitrhesanthAeGcDlinAiScaabl oimveptlhiceamtieodnisano.fTthhies

associations that we are reporting.

AGD measurements were well tolerated by

all subjects and quick to perform, with accept-

able intrae xaminer reliability. Unlike ste-

roid hormones and semen parameters, AGD

measurements are not likely to be sensitive

to physiological and lifestyle factors (stress,

abstinence time, fever, smoking, etc.) and so

may need to be controlled only for body size,

as was the case in our study. Therefore, if our

results are confirmed, AGD may provide a

useful adjunct to these traditional measures of

male reproductive function.

Alternative measures of AGD. AGD has

long been measured in animal studies, but the

difference between readily apparent in

AneGwDboASrnanpdupAsG, aDlthAPouisghnoitt

is clear in humans (Figure 1). AGD has only

recently been measured in epidemiological

studies, and methods for its reliable meas-

urement are still being developed. Several

alternative measurements have been used

in examining AGD in human male infants.

Thankamony et  al. (2009) and Salazar-

Martinez et al. (2004) used AGDAS, whereas Sathyanarayana et  al. (2010) m easu red

et al. (2007) used base of the penis to

new measure (the distance from the tip of the

coccyx to the center of the anus).

In our previous analyses we measured

human infants metabolites in

maternal prenatal urine (Swan 2008; Swan

et al. 2005). We found inverse associations

that were, for most phthalate metabolites,

stronger with AGDAP than with AGDAS. The

distance covered by AGDAP is influenced by

penile width and scrotal (Figure 1). Penile width

as well as testicular

were themselves inversely associated with

some phthalate concentrations in infants

(Swan 2008), as they are in rodents (Barlow

et al. 2004; Gray et al. 2006). Therefore, it is

possible that the associations between infant

AGD and phthalate metabolite concentrations

are stronger for AGDAP than for AGDAS. Because AGD varies with body size, this

must be controlled in analysis. Methods for

doing this have varied. The anogenital index

(AGI; AGD divided by weight) was proposed

by Vandenbergh and Huggett (1995) as a

way to adjust AGD for body size in newborn

mice. Since then, various functions of weight

have been proposed in the calculation of this

index, including cube root of weight (Gallavan et al. 1999) and weight at weaning (Hotchkiss et al. 2004). Swan et al. (2005) used AGI (AGD/weight at exam) at the mean age of 12.8 months, but this method did not completely remove the effect of weight. Therefore, subsequent analysis (Swan 2008) used weight percentile for age (see Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010), a quantity that is largely independent of weight and age and that eliminates confounding by weight. Huang et al. (2009) used AGD, AGD ÷ birth weight, and AGD ÷ birth length.

adults, it should be possible to identify the most androgen-sensitive measure (or measures) and determine which are most strongly related to adult sexual function in adults. Until then, we suggest that future studies continue to collect data on multiple measures.
Limitations. Our population was small and limited in age and ethnicity and thus cannot provide normative values for AGD measurements. We saw some differences in AGD and semen quality by race, but numbers were too small to study this adequately. Further, we obtained independent measurements by two examiners on only eight men, too few to adequately estimate inter-rater reliability. Additionally, we noted a small but systematic change in AGD measurem ents between fall 2009 and spring 2010. Although semen parameters in this population did not vary by study period and period did not confound our primary associations, these data suggest possible measurem ent drift and the need for ongoing quality control, including frequent replicate measurements by independent examiners throughout the course of any future study.
This is the first study in the United States to report on semen quality in young, unselected men. We therefore cannot assess the representativeness of our study population. There are, however, several studies in Europe that evaluated semen quality in men at the time of screening for military service (Jørgensen et al. 2002). Median sperm concentration in our population was 53.5 × 106/mL, comparable to that seen in young men in these European countries (44­62 × 106/mL).
We measured testicular volume with a Prader orchidometer. We saw significant associations between testicular volume and all semen parameters except motility, but not between testicular volume and either meas ure of AGD (data not shown). We could not determine whether this is a result of the relatively coarse measurements available with the orchidometer or whether AGD is not correlated with testicular volume. The distribution of our testicular volume measurements appeared to suggest a tendency to report volume in whole numbers (digit preference) and was clearly not normally distributed. Possibly an ultrasound measurement of testicular volume would answer this question.
Our study participants provided only a single semen sample. However, an earlier study of semen quality in 697 men, most of whom provided two samples, determined that after adjusting for important covariates, it made little difference in epidemiological studies whether the analysis includes men who give one semen sample or two (Stokes-Riner et al. 2007).
Finally, we plan to assess reproductive hormones in a future study. A finding of

higher follicle-stimulating hormone and/or low inhibinB or free testosterone in men with shorter AGD would lend support to the association between AGD and semen variables we report here.
Conclusions
Here we report data showing that one meas ure of AGD is strongly associated with multiple semen parameters, suggesting AGD's potential use as a biomarker of developmental antia ndrogen exposure. As animal studies (Welsh et al. 2008) have clearly shown, AGD is determined within a discrete masculinization programming window that is determined by androgen action. Thus, the confirmation we present here is highly plausible, because, to date, all key relationships shown for AGD in the rat have also been shown in humans.
If AGD (adjusted for body size) is determined prenatally in humans as in rodents, a shorter AGD in adulthood should reflect a shorter AGD at birth, which in turn reflects decreased androgen exposure in utero. Thus, both poorer semen quality and shorter AGD in adulthood may reflect a common origin, including a disruption of testicular development in utero, as suggested by the testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) hypothesis (Skakkebaek et al. 2001). As hypothesized, this syndrome, although potentially multi factorial, may be caused by exposure to endocrine-d isrupting chemicals during the masculinization programming window (Scott et al. 2008). The increasing incidence of male reproductive diso rders (Sharpe and Skakkebaek 2008; Skakkebaek et al. 2001; Toppari et al. 1996) and decreasing sperm counts and testosterone levels (Andersson et al. 2007; Carlsen et al. 1992; Swan et al. 1997; Travison et al. 2007) in many Western countries lend support to this hypothesis. Whether shorter AGD in RYMS men reflects such dysgenesis and whether this is a consequence of fetal antiandrogen exposure are speculative. However, the data we present here, together with our prior study relating shorter AGD to antia ndrogenic phthalate exposure in infants, support that interpretation.
We suggest that a shortened male AGD may be an important marker of human TDS. An extended follow-up of a large cohort in which AGD is measured in infancy would be definitive, but logistically challenging. However, confirmation in larger and more diverse populations and in studies of AGD in men with clinical manifestations of TDS (infertile men, those born with cryptorchidism or hypospadias, or men with testicular cancer) would provide persuasive evidence that androgen action during early fetal life exerts a fundamental influence on adult sperm counts in humans, as has been demonstrated in rodents.
