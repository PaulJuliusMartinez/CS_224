I n spite of advances

in neonatal

ventilatory

care, respiratory

distress syndrome

(RDS) secondary

to surfactant

defi-

ciency'2 continues

to contribute

to an unacceptably

high

mortality

and morbidity

in infants of very low birth weight.

Among survivors of neonatal RDS, 5-38%#{176} sustain long-

lasting lung injury termed bronchopulmonary

dysplasia

(BPD)'8 associated

with oxygen exposure and barotrauma

associated with mechanical

ventilation"

necessary to treat

RDS. Lung injury to the developing respiratory bronchioles,

alveolar spaces, and lung interstitium'4"5

contribute

to the

substantial

morbidity

found in infants with BPD.

We have previously defined a pattern of exfoliative cytol-

ogy with bronchial cells in sheets or clusters with atypical

epithelial

regeneration

associated

with metaplastic

changes'8'7 and have observed, as have others,'8 the promi-

nent finding of inflammatory

cells in the pulmonary effluent

of infants developing

BPD. We reasoned

that any new

therapy for RDS, such as exogenous surfactant supplementa-

tion, must not only improve immediate

clinical indices of

ventilatory

failure found in RDS, but also lessen lung injury

associated with ventilatory

therapy, thereby preventing

or

ameloriating

the occurrence of bronchopulmonary

dysplasia.

Although earlier reports utilizing aerosolized

dipalmitoyl

phosphatidylcholine

for replacement

of deficient surfactant

in neonates were unimpressive,'

recent reports utilizing a

combination

of extracts of bovine lung lavage phospholipids

and protein with an added mixture of desaturated

phos-

phatidylcholine

and phosphatidylglycerol24'

have docu-

mented that surface stability at end-expiration

can be main-

tained in neonatal

animals and human neonates

after

intratracheal

administration

of these agents. However, con-

cerns regarding potential immunologic

reactions in human

infants''

have prevented

the widespread

use of these

heterologous

protein-containing

surface active materials

in

the treatment of RDS.

To circumvent

the potential immunologic

reactions attend-

ant with heterologous

surfactant, we report the use of human

amniotic fluid derived surfactant in a group of infants with

severe respiratory distress syndrome and document both the

clinical response to this therapy and the lessening of lung

injury associated with this mode of treatment.

mg/kg of human surfactant

instilled into the endotracheal

tube

accompanied

by mechanical

ventilation.

Clinical, radiographic

and

pulmonary

effluent data were tabulated prospectively.

Eight infants

without intrinsic lung disease, but requiring endotracheal

tube

intubation and mechanical

ventilation,

were used as a comparison

group for subsequent

analysis of pulmonary

effluent data. Three

infants with clinical and radiographic evidence of severe RDS with

ventilatory

failure with identical criteria as the surfactant

group

received intermittent

mandatory

ventilation

according

to routine

practice in our intensive care unit. Both clinical response and

pulmonary

effluent biochemical

indices of lung injury were com-

pared in the 2 groups with severe RDS.

In all infants, periodic aspiration of pulmonary effluent was

required for pulmonary toilet to ensure endotracheal tube patency.

Using a standardized procedure 1.0-1.5 ml of 0. 9% NaCI was injected

into the endotracheal

tube and mechanical

ventilation

continued

for

15-30 seconds. A suction catheter was inserted through the endo-

tracheal and extended beyond the distal orifice approximately 1cm.

Aspiration of pulmonary effluent was performed with the head

turned to the right and left lateral positions and in the midline. To

clear secretions within the suction catheter, 3.0 ml of saline was

aspirated

through

the catheter into Lukens traps. Pulmonary

effluent in these infants was obtained solely for clinical indications.

We have previously demonstrated that instillation of 1.0 ml of [3H]

saline solution into the tracheostomized

rabbit reaches the distal

respiratory bronchioles within 10-15 seconds of instillation and

analysis of albumin and phospholipid content of pulmonary effluent

collected every 2 hours in the rabbit and every 4 hours in infants

demonstrate similar compositions. Pulmonary effluent samples were

(St. Louis). Human anti a, antitrypsin

antibody and anti-human

albumin antibody were obtained from Cappel (Cochraneville,

PA).

Methoxysuccinyl

(Ala,) Pro-Val paranitroanilide

was obtained from

Vega (Tuscon, AZ). Normal saline solution for intratracheal instilla-

tion was hospital stock.

Pulmonary effluent samples were initially centrifuged at 950 g fur

10 minutes to remove cellular material. Cells were resuspended in

0.9% NaCI and counted after dilution and trypan blue staining.

Cytologic preparations

were stained for subsequent cytologic analy-

sis.

Pulmonary

effluent elastase was measured using the methoxysuc-

cmnyl (Ala,) Pro-Val paranitroanilide

peptide substrate, according to

the technique of Yasutake and Powers.3' Quantification of pulmonary

effluent and serum albumin and a, protease inhibitor was performed

using "rocket" immunoelectrophoresis."

a, protease inhibitor "activity" in lung effluent was measured

using 20 l of 10 gfml porcine elastase incubated with succinyl

(Ala,) paranitroanilide

at 410 nm.

Elastase inhibitory

capacity was determined

by measuring

the

amount of elastase activity retained when pulmonary effluent was

added to 100 il of a 1 p.g/ml solution of porcine pancreatic elastase

that was then reacted with succinyl (Ala,) paranitroanilide

for

residual elastase activity. An aliquot of pulmonary

effluent was

incubated with diisopropylfluoridate

(DFP) or 1, 10 phenanthro-

lmne' prior to incubation

with succmnyl (Ala3) paranitroanilide.

Immunoprecipitation

of pulmonary effluent elastase to mono-

specific antineutrophilic

elastase (provided by Dr. Charles Coch-

rane) were performed by Mr. Ben BohI in Dr. Charles Cochrane's

laboratory.

The antibody was obtained by immunization

of rabbits

with purified human neutrophil elastase.

Elastase activity to particulate elastin in agar (Elastin Products, St.

Louis) was determined

by incubating

pulmonary

effluent in agar

wells and comparing the zones of elastolysis with those of elastase

standards.

RESULTS

Seven infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome by

chest radiograph

were evaluated. All infants required an Flo,

of 1.0 to maintain

a PaO, >50 mm Hg and mean airway

pressures were comparable

during the first 6 hours of life in

both groups. Three infants (birthweight

1,005±155

g) re-

ceived conventional

ventilatory therapy using the Baby Bird

(Bird Corporation,

Palm Springs, CA) designed to maintain a

PaO, between 50-70 mm Hg and the PaCO, <50. Four

infants (birthweight

980 ± 180 g) received 60 mg/kg of human

surfactant in 3.0 ml of 0.6% NaCI instilled into their endo-

tracheal tube with manual ventilation

for 1 minute post-

surfactant administration.

Both groups of infants had contin-

uous transcutaneous

monitoring of PaO,. Eight infants (mean

birthweight

1,840 ± 680 g) without intrinsic lung disease

required mechanical

ventilation with Flo, <.4 for up to 6

days of life. These infants required ventilation

because of

surgery for gastroschesis,

omphalocele,

or because they had

neurologic disease with lack of ventilatory control.

In all the surfactant-treated

infants, there was a dramatic

increase in PaO, (to an average of 162mm Hg) within 5 mm of

surfactant administration.

This rapid and sustained increase

in PaO, permitted

the weaning of Flo, levels and a lowering

of mean airway pressure required for mechanical

ventilation

during the first hour after surfactant administration.

The

conventionally-managed

infants with respiratory

distress

syndrome

required

sustained

mechanical

ventilation

and

higher mean airway pressures for treatment.

`fracheal

effluent analysis in the conventionally

RDS infants demonstrated

a rise in elastase levels over the

first 7 days of life. Peak elastase levels ranged from 32 to 63

p.g/mg during the first week. By comparison,

elastase levels

in the surfactant-treated

infants were modestly elevated

during the first week of life, but were consistently

4-6 fold

less than the conventionally

managed group (Fig 1), yet were

elevated above the levels in infants without intrinsic lung

disease. Eight
intrinsic

infants (mean birthweight

1,840 ± 680 g) without

lung disease required mechanical

ventilation

with

Flo, <.4 for up to 6 days of life. Pulmonary elastase levels in

these infants was 3.7±1.8

days of life. Lung effluent elastase levels remained low and

relatively (Fig 2).

Fujiwara et al'4 noted that 2 of 10 infants treated with

heterologous

surfactant developed

evidence of BPD, and

incidence that approximates

the rate currently experienced

at many centers suggesting

that lung injury sufficient to

result in chronic lung disease still accompanied

heterologous

surfactant therapy.

Based upon our preliminary

studies of infants with severe

RDS treated with human surfactant, we conclude that their

course of RDS is moderated

in terms of required ventilation

and duration of oxygen exposure when compared to conven-

tionally ventilated infants. Furthermore,

analysis of pulmo-

nary effluent of surfactant treated infants reveals evidence of

a reduction in lung injury.

The lung effluent

elastase

has as its origin poly-

morphonuclear

leukocytes

or monocytes

and was charac-

terized as a serine protease by 70% inhibition with DFP and

only slightly by chelation. These inflammatory

cells in the

lung were stimulated

by fictors, including high oxygen

exposure, resulting from surfactant deficiency. Surfactant has

been shown to inhibit macrophage

stimulation

and ex-

ogenous surfactant treatment in infants may result in inhibi-

tion of macrophage

stimulation.

The finding that "active" a, protease

inhibitor

levels

declined to near zero during RDS suggests that a, protease

was either oxidized to the 47,000 Dalton fragment

by

oxidation

of methionyl

residues or by complexing

with

elastase resulting from stimulated leukocytes from Flo,. That

a, protease inactivation

in the surfactant treated infants was

less suggests less elastase concentration,

lower Flo, and

possibly less oxidant generation

in leukocytes

or both. The

moderation

of lung injury probably results from reduced

oxygen exposure with maintenance

of a, protease activity

and reduced free radical oxidant elaboration

into the lung by

neutrophils

or other inflammatory

cells.

Because of the initial encouraging

response to human

surfactant treatment in infants with severe RDS, prospective

randomized

studies are warranted using homologous

surfac-

tant to ameloriate

the known pathophysiologic

effects of

surfactant deficiency and the subsequent

ill effects of BPD

owing to its current therapy.

delivered through the ventilator, and deep endotracheal suctioning

is performed using a 6 Fr catheter. This procedure is repeated 5 times over the space of less than 15 minutes such that a total of 5.0 ml

is instilled per lavage. Three to 4 ml of lavage fluid is routinely recovered and collected in a sputum trap. Lavage total white cell

counts were performed using a hemacytometer.

A cytocentrifuge

preparation

stained using a modified Wright-Giemsa

procedure was

made for differential cell counts. Lavage fluids were centrifuged and

cell-free supernatants were frozen at - 70#{176}fCor later assays. Normal

newborns were lavaged only once at <24 hours; RDS and BPD

infants were lavaged at <24 hours, 48 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, and
