background
It remains controversial whether exposure to combination antiretroviral treatment in-
creases the risk of myocardial infarction.

methods
In this prospective observational study, we enrolled 23,468 patients from 11 previously
established cohorts from December 1999 to April 2001 and collected follow-up data
until February 2002. Data were collected on infection with the human immunodefi-
ciency virus and on risk factors for and the incidence of myocardial infarction. Relative
rates were calculated with Poisson regression models. Combination antiretroviral
therapy was defined as any combination regimen of antiretroviral drugs that included
a protease inhibitor or a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.

results
Over a period of 36,199 person-years, 126 patients had a myocardial infarction. The
incidence of myocardial infarction increased with longer exposure to combination
antiretroviral therapy (adjusted relative rate per year of exposure, 1.26 [95 percent con-
fidence interval, 1.12 to 1.41]; P<0.001). Other factors significantly associated with
myocardial infarction were older age, current or former smoking, previous cardiovascu-
lar disease, and male sex, but not a family history of coronary heart disease. A higher to-
tal serum cholesterol level, a higher triglyceride level, and the presence of diabetes were
also associated with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction.

conclusions
Combination antiretroviral therapy was independently associated with a 26 percent rel-
ative increase in the rate of myocardial infarction per year of exposure during the first
four to six years of use. However, the absolute risk of myocardial infarction was low and
must be balanced against the marked benefits from antiretroviral treatment.

lthough the benefits of combi-
nation  antiretroviral  therapy  have  revo-
lutionized the care of patients with human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection,
increasingly severe treatment-associated metabol-
ic side effects have been observed, among them
dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and overt diabetes
mellitus, which are well-known risk factors for car-
diovascular disease.
 These side effects may in-
crease the risk of premature myocardial infarction,
although direct evidence of such an association is
7-19
inconsistently reported in the existing literature.

To address this concern, and as part of an initia-
tive by the European Agency for the Evaluation of
Medicinal Products, the Data Collection on Adverse
Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (DAD) Study was initiated
in 1999. The primary objective of the study was to
determine whether exposure to combination anti-
retroviral therapy is independently associated with
the risk of myocardial infarction.

methods

design
The study methods have been described previous-
5
ly.
 In brief, we conducted a collaborative, observa-
tional study of 11 previously established cohorts
comprising  23,468  HIV-1–infected  patients  fol-
lowed at 188 clinics in 21 countries in Europe, the
United States, and Australia.

The primary study end point was myocardial in-
farction. The study was designed to permit the de-
tection of a twofold difference in the incidence of
myocardial infarction between two equal groups ac-
cording to their exposure to combination antiretro-
viral therapy. A total of at least 100 new cases of my-
ocardial infarction were required to give the study
sufficient power to detect such an increase in risk
(two-sided type I error, 5 percent; power, 90 per-
cent).  On  the  basis  of  preliminary  data  from  the
EuroSIDA study, the incidence of myocardial infarc-
tion in these HIV-1–infected persons was assumed
to be 3.3 per 1000 person-years (Kirk O: personal
communication), and hence the study had to collect
at least 30,000 person-years of follow-up data be-
fore the primary objective could be examined.

collection of data
Patients  were  followed  prospectively  during  their
regular visits to outpatient clinics. Eligible patients
were all under active follow-up in their individual
cohorts at the time of enrollment in the study, irre-
spective of their antiretroviral-treatment status. Pa-

tients were consecutively enrolled in the study from
clinics in each of the participating cohorts begin-
ning in December 1999; enrollment was complete
by April 2001. At enrollment and at least every eight
months  thereafter,  standardized  data-collection
forms were completed at the sites to provide infor-
mation about the patients’ family history of coronary
heart disease, their history of cardiovascular disease
or diabetes, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, ther-
apy for diabetes mellitus, lipid-lowering and anti-
hypertensive therapy, clinical signs of lipodystrophy,
and serum lipid levels (levels of total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, and tri-
glycerides). Dyslipidemia was defined according to
the U.S. National Cholesterol Education Program
cutoff values for high-risk levels.

ascertainment of outcomes
All new cases of myocardial infarction were report-
ed to the study coordinating office for central vali-
dation  and  for  coding  according  to  procedures
applied in the World Health Organization Multina-
tional Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in
Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA) Project.
 All
events had to satisfy the criteria for a definite, possi-
ble, or unclassifiable myocardial infarction and were
categorized as nonfatal (when the patient survived
to 28 days after onset) or fatal. The diagnosis was
based on an established algorithm
 adapted from
standardized criteria that included cardiac pain, car-
diac enzyme or troponin levels, electrocardiograph-
ic readings, and in cases of death, autopsy results if
available. Nonfatal myocardial infarctions not asso-
ciated with clinical symptoms were not included.

antiretroviral therapy and risk of myocardial infarction

ducted annually and included a review of source doc-
uments for all the reported end points and all cases
of death and an audit of the case notes for a random
sample of 10 percent of the remaining patients. 

The study was supervised by a steering commit-
tee with scientific and organizational independence
from the financial sponsor of the study, a consor-
tium of pharmaceutical companies that market li-
censed antiretroviral agents in Europe and the Unit-
ed States. Until the study reached the predetermined
number  of  person-years  of  follow-up,  members
of the steering committee remained blinded to the
number of end points that had occurred. An exter-
nal expert from the MONICA project evaluated the
documentation of primary end points, and before
the event data base and main study data base were
merged, an end-point committee reviewed the clas-
sification of the primary events.

statistical analysis
All analyses were based on calculations of the in-
cidence rate, with base line being the time of en-
rollment. Only follow-up and events that occurred
prospectively, after enrollment, were counted in the
analyses. Follow-up ceased on the earliest of the fol-
lowing: the date of a primary end-point event, the
date of death (if applicable), February 1, 2002, and
the date six months after the patient’s last contact
for  HIV-1–related care (defined as the most recent
CD4+ cell count or HIV-1 RNA measurement, ini-
tiation of a new antiretroviral regimen, or diagno-
sis of a new acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
[AIDS]–defining illness).

To describe the relation between the incidence
of myocardial infarction and exposure to combina-
tion antiretroviral therapy, each person’s follow-up
was divided into a series of consecutive one-month
periods. A patient’s cumulative exposure to therapy
at the start of each period was calculated (includ-
ing the duration of treatment before enrollment
in this study and during follow-up), and the result
was used to assign the patient-month (and any end-
point events that occurred during that month) to the
appropriate exposure category. The exposure cat-
egories were as follows: no exposure or less than
one year, one to two years, two to three years, three
to four years, and more than four years of exposure.
Follow-up data from patients with more than five
years of exposure were limited. The incidence rate in
each of these categories was calculated as the num-
ber of events occurring divided by the total number
of patient-years in that category.

If a person discontinued therapy, his or her ex-

posure category remained what it had been at the
time of discontinuation; cumulative exposure sub-
sequently increased only if a patient restarted ther-
apy.  No  distinction  was  made  among  treatment
regimens, including regimens based on protease
inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors.

Poisson regression models (GENMOD Proce-
dure, SAS software, version 6.12) were used to quan-
tify the relation between exposure to therapy and
the risk of myocardial infarction, after adjustment
for possible differences in the cardiovascular risk
profile of patients in each exposure category. Visu-
al assessment of the incidence rates in each catego-
ry confirmed that a linear relation between exposure
and incidence was a reasonable assumption. Thus,
exposure was incorporated as a continuous varia-
ble in these analyses.

The  primary  model  was  adjusted  for  demo-
graphic factors (age, body-mass index [the weight
in kilograms divided by the square of the height in
meters], race, presence or absence of a family his-
tory of coronary heart disease, smoking status, and
sex), mode of HIV-1 transmission, cohort, and pres-
ence or absence of preexisting cardiovascular dis-
ease before enrollment. Age was considered a time-
updated, continuous variable and was recalculated
at the start of each patient-month. All the other var-
iables were treated as fixed categorical variables and
took the same value for a given patient at the start
of each month. Data were complete for exposure to
combination antiretroviral treatment and age; how-
ever, for all the other variables, specific categories
were generated for missing data to ensure that all
patients were included in the analyses.

In additional exploratory analyses we assessed
the influence of base-line markers of HIV-1 infec-
tion (CD4+ cell count and HIV-1 RNA level at the
time of enrollment; nadir CD4+ cell count and peak
HIV-1 RNA level before enrollment; and known du-
ration of HIV-1 infection [defined according to the
dates of the earliest CD4+ cell count, HIV-1 RNA lev-
el, AIDS-defining event, or treatment episode]), the
presence or absence of a prior AIDS-defining event,
and the presence or absence of lipodystrophy. Also
analyzed was the influence of established risk fac-
tors for myocardial infarction that may potentially be
influenced  by  combination  antiretroviral  therapy,
including the levels of plasma lipids (total cholester-
-trans-
ol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides [log
2
formed]), the presence of hypertension (defined by
a systolic blood pressure of 150 mm Hg or above, a
diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or above, or

(e.g., lipid levels and hypertension-related variables)
were fitted separately both as fixed covariates (base-
line values only) and as time-updated variables.

sensitivity analysis
In the primary analyses, five myocardial infarctions
that occurred after the censoring date were exclud-

ed. Analyses were repeated with follow-up data cen-
sored on February 1, 2002, or on the date of a myo-
cardial infarction or death. In additional sensitivity
analyses, we considered the incidence of all end
points (including eight recurrent myocardial infarc-
tions, which occurred more than 28 days after a first
primary end-point event); excluded data from pa-
tients with a prior cardiovascular event; excluded
unclassifiable or possible events; and adjusted for

results

base-line characteristics
The study cohort included 23,468 HIV-1–infected
patients; 24.1 percent were women, and the median
age of the patients was 39 years. The median known
duration of HIV-1 infection was 3.5 years, and 26.2
percent of the patients had previously been found
to have AIDS (Table 1). At base line, 80.8 percent of
the study population had been exposed to at least
one antiretroviral drug and 74.5 percent to combi-

nation antiretroviral therapy. Overall, the median
cumulative exposure to combination antiretroviral
therapy was 1.9 years. Because of differences in the
dates when various drug classes were first marketed,
the rate of exposure to protease inhibitors was sub-
stantially higher and the duration substantially long-
er than the rate and duration of exposure to nonnu-
cleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

In this relatively young population, the preva-
lence of previous cardiovascular disease was only
1.5 percent (Table 2). However, many of the subjects
had cardiovascular risk factors: 56.2 percent were
current or previous smokers and 2.8 percent had di-
abetes, 7.2 percent hypertension, and 45.9 percent
dyslipidemia.

follow-up
The median time between clinic visits (according
to assessments of CD4+ cells) during the prospec-
tive follow-up period was three months, without
consistent differences according to the duration of
exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy. The
total number of person-years of prospective follow-
up until the first new myocardial infarction or until
the censoring date for those who remained free of
myocardial infarction was 36,199 (median individ-
ual follow-up time, 1.6 years [interquartile range,
1.3 to 1.9]). A total of 1909 participants (8.1 percent)
had no reported clinic visits during the 12 months
before February 1, 2002. During the follow-up pe-
riod, 566 patients (2.4 percent) were known to have
died; 36 of the deaths (6.4 percent) were due to my-
ocardial infarction, and 26 (4.6 percent) were due
to other cardiovascular events, such as stroke.

Figure 1. Incidence of Myocardial Infarction According to the Duration 
of Exposure to Combination Antiretroviral Therapy.
The incidence of primary events was assessed beginning at base line accord-
ing to the cumulative duration of combination antiretroviral therapy since the 
initiation of therapy, stratified in one-year intervals from the initiation of ther-
apy to four years, more than four years of exposure, and no exposure. The rate 
of myocardial infarction was generally lower among the patients not exposed 
to combination antiretroviral therapy than in any of the treated groups. The 
untreated patients had, a priori, a lower risk of myocardial infarction than the

the patients treated for less than one year, the univariable relative rate among 
the patients with no exposure to therapy was 0.24 (95 percent confidence in-
terval, 0.07 to 0.89); among those with one to less than two years of exposure, 
1.34 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.58 to 3.10); among those with two to 
less than three years of exposure, 1.73 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.80 
to 3.76); among those with three to four years of exposure, 1.98 (95 percent 
confidence interval, 0.94 to 4.15); and among those with more than four years 
of exposure, 2.55 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.25 to 5.20) (P for trend 
<0.001). The vertical bars represent the 95 percent confidence intervals.

incidence of myocardial infarction
A total of 126 patients had a myocardial infarction
during follow-up (incidence, 3.5 events per 1000
person-years). Fifty-five percent of the myocardial
infarctions were categorized as definite and 29 per-
cent  as  possible;  16  percent  were  considered  un-
classifiable. One hundred fourteen of the infarc-
tions (90 percent) occurred in men. Thirty-six of the
events (29 percent) were fatal; 16 of the deaths were
considered to have been caused by an unclassifiable
coronary event (such as sudden death).

The incidence of myocardial infarction increased
with increasing exposure to combination antiret-
roviral therapy (P for trend, <0.001) (Fig. 1). The pa-
tients with no exposure to therapy had a lower in-
cidence of myocardial infarction than for any of the
treated groups. Because the incidence increased
gradually with more extended exposure, exposure
time was fitted as a continuous variable in subse-
quent models. Fitted this way, the relative rate was
1.22 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.38)
per additional year of exposure to combination anti-
retroviral therapy; it was 1.26 (95 percent confidence
interval, 1.12 to 1.41) after adjustment for demo-
graphic risk factors, including age, which increased
with increasing duration of therapy (Table 3).

Other factors that also independently predicted
myocardial infarction were increased age, current
or past smoking, previous cardiovascular disease,

heart disease (Table 3). The primary model also in-
cluded the cohort, race, body-mass index, and mode
of HIV-1 transmission, but in adjusted analyses none
of these variables were independently associated
with the occurrence of myocardial infarction. Inten-
tionally, the model did not include variables such as
plasma lipid concentrations, which could potential-
ly be on the causal pathway from drug exposure to
myocardial infarction.

Individual models were developed for each of the
variables listed in Table 4, which also included all
the variables in the primary model. At base line and
during the prospective follow-up period, the follow-
ing numbers of metabolic measurements were avail-
able for analysis: 82,619 for total cholesterol, 82,341
for triglycerides, and 50,241 for blood pressure. Hy-
pertension was present or developed in 2574 pa-

and the presence of diabetes were all associated with
an increased risk of myocardial infarction (Table 4).
The presence of hypertension at base line was not
significantly associated with the risk of myocardial
infarction, whereas the analysis of time-updated
values did reveal an increased risk. The presence

of lipodystrophy at any time was not significantly
associated with the risk of myocardial infarction.

The association between combination antiretro-
viral therapy and the risk of myocardial infarction
tended to decrease in the models that included to-
tal cholesterol or triglyceride levels, but not in those

* The variables included are metabolic and physiological variables that can be induced or influenced by combination anti-
retroviral therapy and thus may be on the causal pathway. Estimates of the relative rate were obtained from multivariable 
Poisson regression models. In each row, the relative rates for the given variable and for exposure to combination antiret-
roviral therapy are also adjusted for the variables shown in Table 3 (one model per row). CI denotes confidence interval, 
HIV-1 human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and AIDS acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

† Univariable results were in the same direction as the adjusted results for all the variables tested, except for lipodystrophy

that included diabetes, hypertension, or lipodystro-
phy (Table 4). In addition, when total cholesterol
and triglyceride levels were included in the same
model, the association with therapy was not further
affected (relative rate, 1.16 [95 percent confidence
interval, 1.02 to 1.33]).

None of the markers of HIV-1 disease were as-
sociated with myocardial infarction in the adjusted
model. Including these variables in the model did
not modify the association between duration of ex-
posure to combination antiretroviral therapy and
myocardial infarction.

discussion

Although the absolute event rate was low, combi-
nation antiretroviral therapy was associated with a
26 percent relative increase in the rate of myocar-
dial infarction per year of exposure during the first
four to six years of use. This finding is plausible be-
cause combination antiretroviral therapy can cause
adverse metabolic changes that are known risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular disease. However, only ran-
domized trials might be able to prove whether the
observed association reflects a causal relation. In

Previous studies have reached conflicting con-
clusions on this issue, some supporting our find-
ings
 Most studies have
been retrospective in nature and, to varying degrees,
have had other limitations, including short expo-
sure times, a small number of end points, the use of
composite end points, changes in hospital admis-
sion policies over time, and lack of source verifica-
tion for the end points. Two of the largest three stud-
ies failed to detect a relation,
 whereas the third
did.
 Both of the studies that did not detect a re-
lation were based on retrospective extraction of hos-
pital  admission  codes  from  administrative  data

changes in admission policies as well as selection

receiving protease inhibitors and those who were

 suggested that the
rate of admission increased over time and with long-
er periods of exposure to protease inhibitors, al-
though the analysis was based on few events and
was not tested statistically for significance.

Our method has several advantages over those
applied in prior studies. First and most important,
it was a prospective study, and thus it was possible
to implement extensive quality-assurance measures
at the outset to ensure that all myocardial infarctions
were documented according to predefined stan-
 Second, myocardial infarction was inten-

tionally chosen as the primary end point, since the
ascertainment of other cardiovascular events was
considered to be less precise. Third, a diverse study
population was achieved by enrolling patients from
a variety of geographic areas, including substan-
tial numbers of women and members of minority
groups. Thus, our cohort reflects the diverse make-
up of the HIV-1–infected population in industrial-
ized countries.

Our method does have some limitations, how-
ever. We were unable to identify an appropriate co-
hort of HIV-1–negative persons with a similar back-
ground risk of myocardial infarction. Hence, our key
objective was to assess changes in risk according
to the duration of exposure to combination antiret-
roviral therapy. Since the median prospective fol-
low-up time in this study was less than two years,
a comparison based on the duration of exposure to
combination antiretroviral therapy is essentially

a comparison of patients who start therapy in dif-
ferent calendar years. Although adjustment for cal-
endar time did not influence the findings, patients
who started therapy in different years may have had
different profiles of risk for myocardial infarction,
and if so, we may not have been able to adjust for all
those differences. However, we found no evidence
to suggest that the duration of HIV-1 infection, the
level of prior immunodeficiency, or the degree of
HIV-1 RNA replication affected the association be-
tween exposure to therapy and the risk of myocar-
dial infarction. Moreover, none of these variables
had any independent effect on the risk of myocar-
dial infarction. Finally, because of insufficient pow-
er, we are unable at the present time to examine the
risk associated with individual drugs or drug class-
es. As the study continues, our ability to address
these issues will improve.

In an attempt to elucidate a possible mechanism
of the relation between combination antiretroviral
therapy and myocardial infarction, we carried out
preliminary analyses to examine whether the asso-
ciation  was  modified  by  adjusting  for  metabolic
and physiological variables previously noted to have
been influenced by antiretroviral therapy. The re-
sults suggest that the total cholesterol and triglyc-
eride levels have a possible role. Conversely, signif-
icant contributions from diabetes, hypertension,
and lipodystrophy were not identified. Further fol-
low-up, with additional data on myocardial infarc-
tions, will be necessary before firmer conclusions
can be drawn.

27

Combination antiretroviral therapy substantial-
ly improves the prognosis of HIV-1–infected pa-
tients at risk for AIDS. Before the availability of such
therapy, the annual mortality rate among patients
with HIV-1 infection exceeded 20 percent,
 as com-
pared with less than 2 percent in the current study.
Furthermore, among the patients who died, only 6.4
percent died from myocardial infarction; progres-
sion of HIV-1–related disease was the leading cause
of death. Finally, the annual rate of myocardial in-
farction, even among those exposed to therapy for
four to six years, was less than 0.6 percent, and only
a portion of the apparent excess risk could be attrib-
uted to combination antiretroviral therapy. Other
known risk factors for myocardial infarction prob-
26
ably contributed to the occurrence of these events.
Hence, the substantial benefits of combination an-
tiretroviral therapy continue clearly to outweigh the
increased risk of myocardial infarction associated
with this therapy. However, atherosclerosis may take
decades to progress to a clinically detectable de-
