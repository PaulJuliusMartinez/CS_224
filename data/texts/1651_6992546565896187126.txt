15 Bibliographic Databases

Bibliographic Database is a database where all the useful bibliographic entries can be stored. The information about the various publications is stored in one or more files with the extension .bib. For each publication there is a key that identifies it, and which may be used in the text document to refer to it. And this is available for all documents with a list of reference in the field. This database is useful for the authors/researchers who are constantly referring to the same publications in most of their works. This database system is possible with the BIBTEX program supplied with the LATEX package.

15.1. The BIBTEX program
BIBTEX is an auxiliary program to LATEX that automatically constructs a bibliography for LATEX document form one or more databases. To use BIBTEX, you must include in your LATEX input file a \bibliography command whose argument specifies one or more files that contain the database. For example
\bibliography{database1,database2}
The above command specifies that the bibliographic entries are obtained from database1.bib and database2.bib. To use BIBTEX, your LATEX input file must contain a \bibliographystyle

command. This command specifies the bibliography style, which determines the format of the source list. For example, the command
\bibliographystyle{plain}
specifies that entries should be formatted as specified by the plain bibliography style (plain.bst). We can put \bibliographystyle command anywhere in the document after the \begin{document} command.

15.2. BIBTEX Style files

plain unsrt alpha abbrv acm

Standard BIBTEX style. Entries sorted alphabetically with numeric labels. Standard BIBTEX style. Similar to plain, but entries are printed in order of citation, rather than sorted. Numeric labels are used. Standard BIBTEX style. Similar to plain, but the labels of the entries are formed from the author's name and the year of publication.
Standard BIBTEX style. Similar to plain, but entries are more compact, since first names, month, and journal names are abbreviated.
Alternative BIBTEX style, used for the journals of the Association for Computing Machinery. It has the author name (surname and first name) in small caps, and numbers as labels.

apalike

Alternative BIBTEX style, used by the journals of the American Psychology Association. It should be used together with the LATEX apalike package. The bibliography entries are formatted alphabetically, last name first, each entry
having a hanging indentation and no label.

Examples of some other style files are:
abbrv.bst, abstract.bst, acm.bst, kluwer.bst, named.bst, named.sty, agsm.bst, alpha.bst, amsalpha.bst, natbib.sty, natbib.bst, nature.sty, authordatei.bst, authordate1-4.sty, nature.bst, phcpc.bst, phiaea.bst, bbs.bst, cbe.bst, cell.bst, dcu.bst, phjcp.bst, phrmp.bst plainyr.bst, harvard.sty, ieeetr.bst, jtb.bst, siam.bst

Various organisations or individuals have developed style files that correspond to the house style of particular journals or editing houses. We can also customise a bibliography style, by making small changes to any of the .bst file, or else generate our own using the makebst program.

15.2.1.

Steps for running BIBTEX with LATEX
(1) Run LATEX, which generates a list of \cite references in its auxiliary file, .aux. (2) Run BIBTEX, which reads the auxiliary file, looks up the references in a database (one or
more .bib files, and then writes a file (the .bbl file) containing the formatted references according to the format specified in the style file (the .bst file). Warning and error messages are written to the log file (the .blg file). It should be noted that BIBTEX never reads the original LATEX source file. (3) Run LATEX again, which now reads the .bbl reference file. (4) Run LATEX a third time, resolving all references
Occasionally the bibliography is to include publications that were not referenced in the text. These may be added with the command

\nocite{key}
given anywhere within the main document. It produces no text at all but simply informs BIBTEX that this reference is also to be put into the bibliography. With \nocite{*}, every entry in all the databases will be included, something that is useful when producing a list of all entries and their keys.
After running BIBTEX to make up the .bbl file, it is necessary to process LATEX at least twice to establish both the bibliography and the in-text reference labels. The bibliography will be printed where the \bibliography command is issued; it in ifact inputs the .bbl file.

15.3. Creating a bibliographic database
Though bibliographic database creation demands more work than typing up a list of references with the thebibliography environment; it has a great advantage that, the entries need to be included in the database only once and are then available for all future publications even if a different bibliography style is demanded in later works, all the information is already on hand in the database for BIBTEX to write a new thebibliography environment in another format. Given below is a specimen of an entry in bibliographic database:

@BOOK{knuth:86a, AUTHOR TITLE EDITION PUBLISHER ADDRESS YEAR

="Donald E. Knuth", ={The \TeX{}book}, ="third" ="Addison-Wesley", ={Reading, MA}, =1986 }

The BIBTEX program BIBTEX Style files Creating a biblio . . .

The first word, prefixed @, determines the entry type. The entry type is followed by the reference information for that entry enclosed in curly braces { }. The very first entry is the key for the whole reference by which it is referred to in the \cite command. In the above example it is knuth:86a. The actual reference information is then entered in various fields, separated from one another by commas. Each field consists of a field name, an = sign, with optional spaces on either side, and the field text. The field names shows above are AUTHOR, TITLE, PUBLISHER, ADDRESS, and YEAR. The field text must be enclosed either in curly braces or in double quotation marks. However, if the text consists solely of a number, as for YEAR above, the braces or quotation marks may be left off.
For each entry type, certain fields are required, others are optional, and the rest are ignored. These are listed with the description of the various entry types below. If a required field is omitted, an error message will occur during the BIBTEX run. Optional fields will have their information included in the bibliography if they are present, but they need not be there. Ignored fields are useful for including extra information in the database that will not be output, such as comment or an abstract of the paper. Ignored fields might also be ones that are used by other database programs.
The general syntax for entries in the bibliographic database reads
@entry_type{key, field_name = {field text}, .... field_name = {field text} }
The names of the entry types as well as the field names may be written in capitals or lower case letters, or in a combination of both. Thus @BOOK, @book, and @bOOk are all acceptable variations.
The outermost pair of braces for the entire entry may be either curly braces { }, as illustrated, or parentheses ( ). In the latter case, the general syntax reads
@entry_type(key, ... ..)

However, the field text may only be enclosed within curly braces {...} or double quotation marks "..." as shown in the example above.
The following is a list of the standard entry types in alphabetical order, with a brief description of the types of works for which they are applicable, together with the required and optional fields that they take.
@article Entry for an article from a journal or magazine required fields author, title, journal year. optional fields volume, number, pages, month, note
