A Chronic Need for IL-21

tumor treatments (another scenario in which the immune system is subject to chronic antigen exposure) (6, 10), and its therapeutic potential is appealing. At the same time, the capacity of IL-21 to enhance the CD8+ T cell response may come at a cost: Treating chronic LCMV-infected CD4+-deficient animals with IL-21 led to severe sickness (4). Hence, prospective therapeutic use of IL-21 will need to be finely tuned.
CD4+ T cell help is also important for the CD8+ T cell response to various acute infections (2). In such responses, lack of CD4+ help (or lack of IL-2 sensitivity) typically has minimal impact on CD8+ T cell priming, but leads to a failure of memory CD8+ T cells to mount a response to subsequent infection by the same pathogen (2). The current reports find no effect of IL-21 or IL-21R deficiency on the primary CD8+ T cell responses to various acute infections (3­5), and in one study,

memory CD8+ T cell responses to LCMV
were intact (5). Such data strongly suggest that IL-21 is a key element of CD4+ T cell help in CD8+ T cell responses to chronic but
not acute infections. Furthermore, the ele-
vated and sustained production of IL-21 (but not IL-2) in CD4+ T cells from chronically
infected animals contrasts with the sustained
capacity for IL-2 (but not IL-21) synthesis by CD4+ T cells following acute infection (3). Thus, the basis by which CD4+ T cells help the CD8+ T cell responses may change de-
pending on the nature of the infection. IL-21
appears to induce a unique differentiation pathway in activated CD8+ T cells (6, 10, 11),
potentially equipping them to better clear
virus during a chronic infection. Whether the IL-21­producing CD4+ T cells also function
as follicular helper T cells or TH17 cells during chronic viral infection is unclear [al-
though Fröhlich et al. argue against TH17

involvement (5)]. Regardless, these studies suggest a key role for IL-21 in mediating CD4+ help when it's needed most.

CHEMISTRY
Extracting Potentials from Spectra
Peter F. Bernath

An analysis of the spectra of the elusive beryllium dimer, aided by ab initio calculations, characterizes the molecule near its dissociation limit.

For most elements, we know whether they can form a diatomic molecule, especially for light atoms that have few electrons and can be treated readily by theory. But for one such light element, surprises are still in store. For most of the 20th century, experimental and theoretical studies agreed that the beryllium dimer (Be2) did not exist. The Be atom has filled electron shells and-- like the inert gases such as helium--was expected to form at most a weak van der Waals dimer at very large internuclear distances.Yet, as shown experimentally by Merritt et al. on page 1548 of this issue (1), Be2 does exist and has a relatively short bond (2.45 Å), relative to the anticipated van der Waals complex with a bond length of about 5 Å. Its unusually flat potential curve limits the number of vibrational levels and provides the rare opportunity to study the highest vibrational state of a molecule just at its dissociation limit.
Experiments with beryllium are difficult because the metal is refractory (it has a low vapor pressure even at very high temperatures) and because beryllium-containing compounds are generally extremely toxic. However, Be vapor can be created through laser ablation of a Be metal target. Rapid cool-
