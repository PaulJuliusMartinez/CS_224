ABSTRACT
To investigate the importance of the reciprocal effect in a series of Australia-wide radiata pine 6 x 6 half-diallel matings, one diallel mating set was deliberately mated to include reciprocal crosses. At age ten and a half, five traits (DBH, stem straightness, branch angle, branch size and cluster whorl number) were assessed at four sites, and the reciprocal effects were estimated and partitioned into the maternal and non-maternal components.
General combined ability was significant ( P < 0.001) for DBH, stem straightness, branch angle, and branch size while specific combined ability was significant (P < 0.039) for stem straightness, branch angle, and cluster number. The overall reciprocal effect was significant for branch angle only; however, there were reciprocal effects in individual pair-crosses for DBH, branch size and cluster number. A partitioning of these significant reciprocal effects suggests either maternal (e.g. cytoplasmic DNA effect) and non-maternal effects (e.g. interaction effect between nuclear and cytoplasmic DNA) or purely non-maternal interaction may be the causes of the reciprocal effects. The observed overall weak reciprocal effect in this experiment indicates that (1) reciprocal mating could be used if it is easier or cheaper to use a particular parent as female for commercial production in radiata pine, and (2) half-diallel mating is suitable for the mating design to estimate genetic parameters and variance components, and pooling reciprocal crosses into a half-diallel mating structure should be acceptable for the standard half-diallel genetic analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Mating designs are an integral factor of any tree breeding program. As such, they constrain, and are constrained by the choice of breeding strategy and the management of co-ancestry. Crucial to designing a tree breeding strategy is to choose mating designs to accomplish the estimates of parental breeding values and genetic parameters (BRIDGWATER1992). Half-diallel and balanced factorial mating designs are two popular mating designs in tree breeding programs, because they can provide for excellent estimates of general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects and good management of coancestry (VAN BUIJTENEN1976; STONECYPHEeRt al. 1996). Since there can be two mating arrangements for each paircross in monoecious species in the factorial and halfdiallel mating designs (parents can serve as either males and females), one important concern in using factorial and half-diallel mating designs is the possibility of reciprocal effects. The reciprocal effect, if significant, may create operational difficulty in arranging controlled pollination for seed production (i.e. male and female are not inter-changeable in the mating) and in genetic analysis if it was not accounted for.

Trees do not always have equal ability to produce similar amounts of male or female flowers, and they vary in their production of viable seeds. For example, in the plus trees in the Australia radiata pine breeding program, one clone with excellent growth (clone registration 12038) produces very little or no seeds if it is mated as female at early ages. Therefore, this clone is preferred as a male in practical mating designs and in controlled pollination for producing commercial seeds. If there are reciprocal (or rather, favourable maternal) effects for crosses involving this particular clone, these effects cannot be readily used because the clone is best used as a male. Also, in some large factorial or disconnected half-diallel experiments, there are always some prescribed crosses that cannot be made or are very difficult to make owing to unavailability of mature ramets, insufficient flowers, poor pollen viability or poor mating success. To overcome these problems, it is not uncommon for the reciprocals to be used for the most desirable crosses to complete the mating design. This is the case in 21 sets of a 6 x 6 half-diallel mating scheme for radiata pine Australia-wide in the early 1980s. All 21 sets involved reciprocal crosses in order to make up the desired half-diallel design. If reciprocal effects were considerable in such a design, it would

design is most suitable for the diallel mating design

because it needs relatively few crosses (BRIDGWATER

1992). On the other hand, if there are considerable

reciprocal effects, the number of crosses may need to

be substantially increased in order to partition recipro-

cal effects from GCA and SCA effects.

According to COCKERHAMand WEIR (1977),

reciprocal effects can be further partitioned into mater-

nal (general reciprocal) and non-maternal (specific

reciprocal) effects. This further partition may allow the

genetic causes of the reciprocal effects to be inferred:

CLUST had normal distributions, therefore only analyses for these five traits are presented in this report. The following three linear models were used for the analysts. The first model is a family effect model as
where Yl,,il, is the individual observation, C] is the grand mean, I, is the 1'" site, r,,,, is the mthreplicate at the Ith
site, A, is the ijthfamily effect, If,ijis the interaction
between the Ith site and the ijth family, r$mij(,, is the interaction between the mthreplicate at the Ilh site and the ijthfamily, and el,,ilkis the residual. The second model partitions the family effect into GCA (gior g,), SCA (sJ and reciprocal (recij)effects and the family by site interaction effects into the interactions of GCA by
site (lgli+ lg,,.),SCA by site (Islij)and reciprocal by site
(1reclij):
The third model partitions the reciprocal effect into maternal (mi) and non-maternal (nnzij)effects, and the reciprocal by site interaction effects (lreclij)into maternal by site (lmIi+lnzU) and non-maternal by site (lnm,,-) interactions:
+ lg,,+ lg,, + Isl,-+ lm,, + hlj+ 1nmlij+ elm,, [3]
Family x within-site replicate effects were not further partitioned into GCA, SCA, and reciprocal by replicate effects because the complexity of the model and less interest for these effects. All effects are assumed fixed in this analysis in order to estimate effects of single parents, therefore, following restrictions are imposed in order to estimate GCA, SCA, reciprocal, maternal and

non-maternal effects: e.g, t g , = 0, Is,. = 0 for each j with s1 = s11. , rec =11 -recji, Emi = 0, tnm, = Enmj = 0
with nm,, = -nnlli . The formulae for mean of squares
and estimated effects (GCA; SCA, reciprocal, maternal and non-maternal effects) have been worked out for balanced design (no missing crosses) (GRIFFING1956, COCKERHA&MWEIR1977)and have been incorporated into a computer program (ZHANG& KANG 1997). However, for designs with missing crosses such as our experiment with radiata pine, these formulae are not directly useful for the analysis. Estimates of reciprocal and maternal effects have been estimated by using DIALL program (a Fortran program) when there are missing crosses (SCHAFFER& USANIS1969), .but estimation of non-maternal effect was not implemented in the program. Derivation of the appropriate design matrix for the reciprocal effect, maternal effect and non-maternal effects for the mating design is required. This is derived for this particular mating pattern as in Appendix 1. This customised design matrix is incorporated into SAS GLM (Type 111) and IML procedures (SAS Institute Inc. 1989) for hypothesis testing and estimating model effects.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Analysis of variance by family effect model (model 1) indicates that all effects (site, replicate, family, site by family, family by replicate interactions) are significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) for the traits DBH, and CLUST (Table 1). Except for family by replicate interaction effect, all effects are significant for STEM. Similarly, all other effects in the model 1 are significant except for replicate for BRA and BRS, and interaction between replicate and family for BRA. The significant family-
and family x site interaction effects suggest further
partitioning of these effects into GCA, and SCA and their interactions with site aremeaningful and necessary for the complete genetic analysis.

that GCA is generally the main contributor to the family effects among the five traits. This is because GCA is significant in four (DBH, STEM, BRA, and BRS) of the five traits ( P _< 0.02 ), while SCA is significant only in STEM, BRA and CLUST ( P _< 0.04, Table 2). The overall reciprocal effect was only significant (P _< 0.04) for one trait (BRA) although P L 0.10 for DBH and P < 0.12 for CLUST. Similarly, the interactions
between family and site are mainly due to site x GCA
effects: site by GCA interactions are all significant for the five traits, while only BRS and CLUST have significant SCA x site interactions. Reciprocal x site interactions are also significant for STEM, BRA, BRS and CLUST.
Partitioning of reciprocal effects into maternal and non-maternal effects for DBH and BRA shows a significant non-maternal effect (P <0.02) for DBH, and a significant maternal effect (P < 0.01) for BRA. The non-maternal effect in BRA is significant at P _< 0.12, and maternal effect in CLUST is significant at P < 0.10. Similarly, further partitioning of significant reciprocal x site interactions for STEM, BRA, BRS and CLUST indicates that the interactions are mainly due to significant maternal by site interaction. This is because non-maternal by site interaction is significant only for

STEM (P < 0.01) while for all four maternal x site interactions (P < 0.05).
Detailed examination of reciprocal effects and their partition into maternal and non-maternal effects in Table 3 reveals:
1. The reciprocal effect for the pair-wise mating between parents 2 and 5 (R25) is significant for DBH (P < 0.02). None of the six maternal reciprocal effects are significant for DBH, however, non-maternal effect of parents 2 and 5 (N25) and parents 5 and 6 (N56) are highly significant (P < 0.001). This indicates the nonmaternal reciprocal effects for N25 and N56 are the contributors to the reciprocal effect involving parents 2 and 5 (R25).
2. The reciprocal effects for two mating pairs (parents 1 and 4, and parents 2 and 6) are significant for BRA ( P < 0.02 and P < 0.002, respectively). The significant reciprocal effect between parents 2 and 6 is associated with the maternal effect of parent 6 (M6) and the non-maternal reciprocal effect between parents 2 and 6 (N26) because M6 and N26 are highly significant (P < 0.003 and P < 0.007, respectively).
3. The reciprocal effect for the mating pair of parents 4 and 6 is highly significant for CLUST (P < 0.001). This may be due to the significant maternal

It is commonly believed that maternal effects are
due to epigenetic effects (such as cytoplasmic genetic

factors or environmental preconditioning) of the mother tree, while non-maternal reciprocal effects are due to interaction between nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic factors or interaction between the environment of the mother tree with nuclear genetic factors (BORGES 1987).

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The effect of environmental preconditioning of mother tree may disappear after a period of seedling growth, but its existence in the first few years complicates effective early selection (Wu et al. 1995). Similarly, the non-maternal reciprocal effect: e.g. the interaction between mother tree environment and
