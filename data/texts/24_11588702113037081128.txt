Introduction
· One key issue in graphics is the rendering of cuts and deformations
Discontinuous Displacement Mapping for Volume Graphics, Volume Graphics 2006, July 30, Boston, MA

Previous Approaches
· Physically based, e.g., finite elements, massspring models, meshless methods
Nealen et al. 2005 Volumes Æ typically via a proxy mesh
· Non-physically based
­ Surface Æ free-form , procedural, displacementbased
­ Volume Æ free-form (Westermann, 2000) Æ Ray deflectors (Kurzion & Yagel, 1997) Æ Spatial TFs (Chen et al, 2003) Æ Volume Browsing (McGuffin, 2003)

Goal
· To start with an illustration of what we want and put it in the object
· Similar to displacement maps

Traditional Displacement Mapping
V-ray rendering system http://www.spot3d.com/vray
· Commonly used to add details to a base surface
· Applied along normal · Usually continuous

Traditional Displacement Mapping (cont.)
· Surface subdivision
Lee et al. Displaced Subdivision Surfaces
­ Limitations of surface representation can be solved using a tetrahedral mesh: further complicates the problem of tessellation
· Ray tracing
Wang et al. Generalized Displacement Maps Discontinuous Displacement Mapping for Volume Graphics, Volume Graphics 2006, July 30, Boston, MA
Cuts
· Difficult to model cuts and large deformations · Surface Subdivision Æ Needs re-meshing · Ray Tracing Æ Handle intersection with new
surface, can't model large unorthogonal deformations · Ray Deflectors Æ Difficult to model surface of cut as rays get deflected · For ray tracing/warping, is easier to render cuts and deformations with inverse mapping

Solution
· 3D Displacements: model large deformations and cuts (no re-meshing)
· Inverse Mapping: High resolution rendering of cuts
· Directly on volumes: need an "inside" to properly model cuts

Discontinuous Displacement Mapping
· Given a common reference coordinate frame · A position function P and a displacement D · Since we use inverse mapping · We use

Displacement Setup
· Specify forward displacement
· Sample its inverse at discrete positions
· What about empty space (due to cuts)?
­ Define displacement there too (to maintain C0 continuity ­ correct tri-linear interpolation)
­ Define alpha map (represent cut geometry)

Original volume

Displaced volume

· Define desired detail and "add" to scene · Like displacement maps, we "add" the displacement to
the volume. We then render this new volume

Rendering Pipeline
· Sample scene bounding box (resulting scene) then find opacity and color attributes of each point using inverse transformation

Problem: add lighting
· Displaced volume with no lighting
Discontinuous Displacement Mapping for Volume Graphics, Volume Graphics 2006, July 30, Boston, MA

Using Original Normals
· Using the original normals result in incorrect lighting
Discontinuous Displacement Mapping for Volume Graphics, Volume Graphics 2006, July 30, Boston, MA
Transformed Normals · Barr [1984] derived
transformation of normals for forward mapping. We derive for inverse displacements:
· Normals on the rim of cut are still incorrect since a new surface has been created

Adjusted Normals near Cuts
· Blend with normal of alpha map to handle normals at discontinuities

Discussion I: Interactive Manipulation · Displacements can be placed and rotated within the
volume. This is done via linear transformations, represented as 4x4 matrices.

Discussion II: Multiple Displacements
· Multiple Displacements can be placed, e.g., through addition of displacements
p = p' + D1(p') + D2(p')
Discontinuous Displacement Mapping for Volume Graphics, Volume Graphics 2006, July 30, Boston, MA
Discussion III: Composition
· One of the advantages of Displacement Maps is the ability to operate algebraically, e.g., through composition.
p1 = p' + D1(p') p = p1 + D2(p1)
· Composition is, in general, not commutative
D1: ripples D2: peel

Discussion IV: GPU
· GPU texture memory size
­ Current displacements occupy 320 KB - 6 MB. Still much smaller than the volume
­ Complex 3D displacements might require larger sizes

Semantics
· Displacement is specified with no regards of semantics of data (planar cuts)
· Need a mechanism to preserve/constrain to features in the dataset (to appear, IEEE Visualization 2006)

Conclusions
· Illustrative Deformation is a powerful technique to simulate effects in volume graphics, such as fracturing, slicing, deforming and cutting.
· Can be efficiently implemented via Discontinuous Displacement Maps
· We devised a collection of techniques for implementing this method in real-time in contemporary GPUs
· Applications: Special effects, VR, Illustration, Surgical Planning, Games.
