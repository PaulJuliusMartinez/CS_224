Japan and the Carribean

basin, in the south-

eastern United States, Central and South America, and

equatorial Africa.7 Taiwan has not been considered to be an

endemic area of HTLV-I infection,8'9 but ATL has been

identified

in patients

born in Taiwan.'#{176}" Interestingly,

HTLV-I infection is seldom found in Mainland China.'2

Previous studies in Japan'3 and in the United States'4

reveal that patients with hematologic

malignancy

are at

increased risk for HTLV-I infection. Transfusion

of HTLV-I

seropositive

blood is probably the most important

source of

viral transmission

in these patients.'3'5

Although cases of

HTLV-I associated

myelopathy

were linked with a high

frequency of previous blood transfusion,'6

ATL has not been

reported from either seropositive

hematological

patients or

those undergoing

seroconversion

after blood transfusion.'7

Two possible reasons are proposed: ( 1) some unknown risk

factors or triggering

mechanisms

other than HTLV-I may

contribute

to the development

in hematological

ATL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Identification

ofHTLV-!

Infection

Screening for HTLV-I antibodies with an enzyme-linked

immu-

nosorbent

assay (ELISA)

was carried out using antigen plate

(Diagnostic

Biotech Research

Lab Inc. Singapore)

coated with

disrupted HTLV-I viral particles purified from HUT-102

culture

supernatant.

HTLV-I seropositivity was confirmed by Western blot analysis

using Diagnostic Biotech kits. The antigen strips contain electropho-

retically separated

peptides of HTLV-I virion pelleted from MT-2

culture supernatant.

Sera were tested at a dilution of 1 : I 00. Immu-

nohistochemical

detection was performed

with an avidin-biotin

system. Serum specimens with antibodies to both p19 and p24

antigens were considered to be positive.

Detection of proviral HTLV DNA sequences

in leukemic cells

was performed as the confirmation study of the diagnosis of ATL.

Tumor tissues from the seropositive

patients and 14 HTLV-I anti-

body-negative individuals were sampled for Southern blot analysis of

HTLV-I proviral genome. Cells from the HTLV-I-positive

MT-2

cell line, and two well-documented

ATL patients, were used as

positive controls. Briefly, DNA was extracted

with phenol/chloro-

form from the tumor tissue lysate. Extracted DNA was then

digested with restriction endonuclease

Pst-I and EcoR I , gel electro-

phoresed, and transfered

to nitrocellulose

paper by Southern blot

technique. The paper was hybridized

with a 32P-labelled

full

genomic HTLV-I probe (8.0 kb), isolated from a pMT-2 clone (Diagnostic Biotech), and exposed to Kodak (Rochester, NY) x-ray

film. The resulting autoradiograms

were interpreted for evidence of

HTLV-I DNA sequences.

Patients and Normals

From February

1983 to April 1987, 354 hematological

patients

admitted

to National Taiwan University

Hospital were routinely

screened for HTLV-I antibodies.

A simultaneous

survey of prevalance

of HTLV-I infection in the

general population in Taiwan was also conducted as described

elsewhere.20 Briefly, specimens of 7,278 inhabitants of different age

and sex were collected from 20 communities of Taiwan by stratified

random sampling methods and screened for HTLV-! antibodies.

An

increased incidence rate of HTLV-I

antibody with age has been

NEOPLASMS

invariably found in the studies in Japan'8'' and Taiwan.#{176} In order to

obtain an age-correspondence

comparison of the HILV-I incidence

between the normal population and the hematological

patients, only

5,252 health adults (over age 20 years) out ofthe total 7,278 persons

were included as the control group in the present study.

Statistics.

The significance of difference in HTLV-I seroposi-

tive rate between hematological patients and general populations

was tested by goodness of fit chi-square test, using the positive rate in

the general populations to calculate the expected positive number of

the hematological patients.

RESULTS

The prevalence rate of HTLV-I infection in healthy adults

and in hematological

patients is shown in Tables I and 2.

There was no difference in age and sex between the two

groups. The details of the results in the healthy inhabitants

were published in another article.#{176} Eight of 354 (2.23%)

adult patients

with either hematological

malignancy

or

aplastic anemia were found to be asymptomatic

carriers,

compared

with 34 of 5252 (.65%) healthy

adults.

This

difference represents a 3.5-fold-increase

in HTLV-I seropo-

sitivity in the patient group (P < .001).

Clinical profiles of the eight hematological

patients with

HTLV-I

antibodies

are listed in Table 3. Six of eight

hematological

patients had multiple platelet and/or granulo-

cyte transfusions.

Among the 346 hematological

patients

seronegative

for HTLV-I,

177 (51.2%) also had available

history of blood transfusion.

We were unable to calculate

the

exact numbers or units of blood products transfused in every

patient, because some received their previous transfusions at

many local hospitals and were difficult to trace back. Two

hematological

patients later developed ATL. Both patients

were long-term

survivors

of the primary

hematological

malignancy,

and both were multi-transfused.

In contrast,

none of the 34 HTLV-I seropositive

healthy carriers devel-

oped ATL over a similar time period. The difference

was

statistically

significant

(0/34 v 2/8, P = .03) by Fisher's

exact test.

Case Reports

Both case A and case B were Chinese who were lifetime

residents

of Taiwan.

Both were married and were restric-

tively heterosexual.

There was no history of intravenous drug

use and no travel history outside of Taiwan.

man presented

with

type, with

typical Reed-Sternberg

cells (Fig I A). Positive reaction of

Reed-Sternberg

cells to Leu Mi monoclonal antibody (Beck-

ton-Dickinson,

Mountain

View, CA) was demonstrated

using the avidin-biotin

complex immunoperoxidase

method22

(Fig I B). Para-aortic

lymphadenopathy

was demonstrated

by lymphangiography.

After receiving six courses of COPP

(cyclophosphamide,

vincristine,

prednisolone,

and procarba-

zinc), he achieved complete remission lasting for 2'/2 years.

He underwent

further chemotherapy

including bleomy-

cin-COPP,

ABVD (adriamycin,

bleomycin, vinblastine, and

DTIC), and BCNU-COPP

and Mantle irradiation for recur-

rent disease from March 1982 to July 1984, with complete

temporary response. In July 1984, Hgb was 8.0 gm/dL and

WBC 6.7 x 109/L, with normal differentials.

Bone marrow

studies revealed erythroid hypoplasia secondary to previous

chemotherapy.

On July 1984, he had his first blood transfu-

sion. Although the bone marrow studies revealed no evidence

of lymphoma

or lymphocytosis,

reenlargement

of para-aortic

lymph nodes was demonstrated

by computed

tomography

scanning. The abdominal lymph nodes responded to chemo-

therapy with BCNU-COPP.

The patient developed pneumo-

nia, however, and received multiple

blood transfusions

for

granulocytopenia

and thrombocytopenia.

In December 1984, he was found to have mild lymphocy-

tosis approximately

I 50 days after his first blood transfusion.

WBC was 12.7 x 109/L, with 48% lymphocytes.

In April

I 985, he developed generalized

erythroderma

over the face

and neck area. Hgb was 15.9 gm/dL. WBC was 17.5 x

109/L with 75% lymphocytes.

Serological

tests for HTLV-I using ELISA test and West-

em blot analysis were negative in October and December

1983, and also in July 1984, 1 week before his first transfusion (Fig 2). All other members of his family, including his wife who had travelled twice to Japan, were seronegative

with both ELISA and Western blot analyses. His history was

remarkable

for shared hospital rooms with two ATL patients

in early 1983 (2 months)

and in late 1984 (1 month),

respectively. The patient's serum was negative for human immunodefi-

ciency virus (HIV) by ELISA and Western blot analysis.

He soon developed hypercalcemia

and died 4 months after

the initial presentation oflymphadenopathy.

Familial studies

of HTLV-I

in 1984 showed that the wife was weakly

sero-positive,

while a baby born in 1982 was sero-negative,

suggesting possible horizontal transmission

of the retrovirus

from her husband. Screening for HIV was also negative.

DISCUSSION

ATL is a HTLV-I-related

disease with characteristic

geographical

distribution.

It has been very difficult

to

explain how this virus became established in a very limited

area of southwestern

Japan. It is interesting

that ATL is

seldom found in some neighboring

countries of Japan, such

as Mainland China'2 and South Korea.23 In contrast, ATL is

not uncommon in Taiwan.9"

Results from various indepen-

dent epidemiological

studies8'9'2#{176d}isclose that approximately

.50 to 1.0% of inhabitants

in Taiwan are HTLV-I seroposi-

tive. It is hard to speculate the reasons of the presence of

HTLV-I in Taiwan v Mainland China because data on the

origin of HTLV-I are fragmentary

and controversial.

Hinu-

ma23 considers that the original ATLV carriers were the

ancient, earliest inhabitants

of Japan, while Ga11o24 specu-

lates that the virus originated in central Africa and spread

with Africans via the slave trade to American,

or via

Portugese seamen to the southwestern coastal area of Japan.

Historically,

Taiwan is remarkable

for heavy contact with

Portugese in the 16th century, and also for 50 years' occupa-

tion by the Japanese in the early 20th century. It might be

important to point out that the Taiwan aborigines, previously

considered

to be free of HTLV-I

infection

in a smaller

survey,8 were now shown to have similar carrier rate com-

pared to the Taiwan Chinese.9'20 Distinctive

geographical,

historical, and ethnic background

of Taiwan should all be

taken into consideration

in proposing the possible routes of

HTLV-I

invasion into Taiwan.

ders when compared to the normal populations.

It is notable

that such phenomenon

is observed in both of the endemic and

nonendemic

area of HTLV-I infection. However, HTLV-I

infected patients with hematological

disorders have not been

reported to have developed

ATL, although an increased

frequency

of previous

blood transfusion

was seen in HTLV-

I-associated

myelopathy.'6

The two patients reported herein initially had hematologi-

cal neoplasms, acquired I-ITLV-I infection, and subsequently

developed

ATL and died of ATL. Many investigators

agree

that transfusion

of HTLV-I seropositive

blood from the

unscreened

donor is probably the most important source of

viral transmission

in these patients.'3'5

In our studies, such a

route of transmission

was highly possible, although we were

unable to document that the two patients were exposed to the

HTLV-I

seropositive

blood when they received component

therapy for their primary hematological

disorders. The first

patient was seronegative

for anti-HTLV-I

antibody until one

week before his first blood transfusion.

Although the possi-

bility of HTLV-I infection prior to transfusion could not be

definitively exluded in case B, the chance seemed very rare,

and the development

of ATL suggests that certain triggering

mechanisms

might be related to his hematological

disorders.

Case A presented

features of both Hodgkin's

disease and

ATL. Traditionally,

Reed-Sternberg

cells are regarded as

pathognomonic

for Hodgkin's disease. Recently, this concept

has been challenged

because giant cells resembling

Reed-

Sternberg

cells have been reported in peripheral

T-cell

lymphoma

including

ATL.25'26 In case A, the diagnosis of

Hodgkin's

disease was made based on the presence of

Reed-Sternberg

cells and its expression

of Leu-M 1 . Several

investigators

have proposed that Leu M I represents a useful

immunodiagnostic

marker of Hodgkin's

disease.27'28 As

Wieczorek et a129 recently reported that Leu-M 1 might not

be specific in distinguishing

Hodgkin's disease from other

lymphoid proliferative

disorders, the expression of Leu M I in

case A does not definitively diagnose Hodgkin's disease. The

absence of the HTLV-I proviral genome in the tissues

obtained in 1979 is uncertain.

However, the patient was

seronegative

for HTLV-I before his first blood transfusion.

Although seronegative

ATL has been rarely reported303'

and

sero-negative

ATL mimicking

Hodgkin's

disease

has been

described

recently,31'32

seronegativity

of duration

longer than

10 years, as in case A, would be extremely

unlikely. Second,

he presented lymphadenopathy

I 3 years prior to the appear-

ance of cutaneous

lesions; this is unusual even in smoldering

ATL, in which skin lesions are almost the earliest manifesta-

tion, while lymphadenopathy

suggests disease accelera-

tion.33'34 A long-term preleukemic state, characterized

by an

insidious onset and appearance

ofabnormal

T lymphocytosis

(10% to 40%) in the peripheral blood without clinical symp-

toms35'36 was also not suggested

by the course of case A.

Third, before 1984, the patient's response to Hodgkin's-

disease-directed

treatment

with complete remission lasting 2

years is unusual for ATL.3'32 His course suggests that he had

Hodgkin's disease since 1971, and did not have ATL before

July 1984 at least.

In case B, the link between blood transfusion

and HTLV-I

transmission

was not directly demonstrated.

In addition,

presence of HTLV-I

seropositivity

in his wife might initiate a

question that he could have been infected by his wife prior to

his transfusion.

However, we considered

that the possibility

of such a chance would be extremely unlikely based on the

following reasons. First, prior studies in monkeys37 and in the

familial

occurrence

of ATL38 suggest that the horizontal

transmission

of HTLV-I

among the spouse is essentially

from husband to wife. Second, none of the parents and the

siblings of the wife was seropositive

for HTLV-I,

indicating

that she was not infected via the vertical transmission

from

her parents; besides, she had no prior history of blood

transfusion.

Hence, the most likely source of infection was

from case B. Third, the ELISA test was only weakly positive

in the patient's wife, and the baby born in 1982 was

seronegative

for HTLV-l,

suggesting that she was probably

newly infected with HTLV-I. It is thus feasible to speculate

that case B was most likely infected with HTLV-I via blood

transfusion

in 1973, and his wife was later infected from

him.

The present study suggests that patients with hematologi-

cal malignancy

who are carriers of HTLV-I may be at

increased

risk for ATL. Although

the etiologic

factors con-

tributing to the development

of ATL are still unknown, host

immunity

may be important.

An intact immune

system

might prevent or delay the malignant transformation.

In the

present series two of eight hematological

patients developed

ATL, while in the same time duration, no ATL was observed

among the 34 HTLV-I healthy carriers. The difference is

statistically

significant by Fisher's exact test. Also, in com-

parison to the estimated annual incidence of 1/1,300 to 1,600

per virus carriers over 40 years of age,39'#{176}the tendency of

transformation

in the immunocompromised

patients in-

creases

remarkably.

In addition,

the latent period from

possible primary viral infection to malignant transformation

in case A is much shorter than previously reported periods of

up to 10 to 20 years.'9'23'4' Thus, the immunocompromised

HTLV-I

carrier may be at increased risk for ATL. We can

expect to see similar such patients in the near future;

long-term follow-up in this group of patients is imperative.

The present report suggests

that serious consideration

must be given to prevent HTLV-I infection via transfusion

in

immunocompromised

patients.

Even in nonendemic

areas

such as Taiwan, routine serological

screening for HTLV-I

antibody

in blood donors is indicated

to permit deferral

of

blood product donations by asymptomatic

HTLV-I carriers.
