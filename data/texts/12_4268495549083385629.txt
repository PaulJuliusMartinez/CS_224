ABSTRACT
Following the standard methodology for measuring industry-of-origin or productionside PPPs, this study compares the unit values of manufacturing products in China, Japan, Korea and the US to calculate unit value ratios (UVRs) and hence estimates PPPs for individual manufacturing industries using the US as the base country in circa 1935. Based on the products that could be matched between these countries, the estimated manufacturing production PPPs for China, Japan and Korea are only from half to two thirds of the prevailing market exchange rates, suggesting much lower cost of production in manufacturing in these countries than in the US. The estimated PPPs are used to calculate industry-level output and labour productivity in China, Japan and Korea relative to those of the US in circa 1935. The results show that the size of factory manufacturing in Japan was 12 percent of the US level whereas in China it was only one percent and even lower in Korea. In terms of comparative labour productivity, measured as PPP$ per hour worked with the US as the reference, Japanese and Korean manufacturing was 24 and 23 percent of the US level, whereas Chinese manufacturing was only 7 percent of the US level.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Post-World War II rapid economic growth of the East Asian economies cannot be well understood without a proper measure of the pre-WWII economic conditions in an internationally comparative framework. What is missing in the conditional convergence literature is a measure on real production costs at industry level especially for producer goods manufacturing that plays a key role in the modern economic development.
Level of a country's real per capita GDP measured by expenditure-side purchasing power parities (PPPs) is by nature a measure of a nation's welfare level relative to that of the benchmark country. While it may suggest the country's relative stage of economic development but does not directly measure the level of its industrialization and (industry-specific) labour productivity compared with those of the benchmark country.1 It has been widely accepted that "industry-of-origin" or production-side PPP approach is a more appropriate direct method for measuring such conditions between countries (see Rostas, 1948; Paige and Bombach, 1959; Maddison, 1970 and 1983).2 This is because by comparing industry-specific producer prices between countries we can measure the relative real factor costs of production at industry level by taking into account the prices of both tradables and (implicitly) nontradables, which will shed important light on a country's comparative advantage and international competitiveness.
The current study attempts to fill this gap in literature to measure the pre-WWII East Asia comparative output and labour productivity by constructing production-side PPPs in manufacturing for three major East Asian economies, China, Japan and Korea, with the US as the reference country in circa 1935 ­ the best pre-war period. This is particularly important for the understanding of the pre-WWII economic conditions in China. Compared with Japan and Korea, 3 historical macroeconomic statistics for
1 The expenditure PPP approach was pioneered by Gilbert and Kravis (1954) and developed by Kravis, Heston and Summers in the International Comparison Program (ICP) since the 1960s and resulted in the Penn World Tables (see Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982; Summers and Heston, 1991).
2 See Maddison and van Ark (2002) for a comprehensive review of the industry-of-origin PPP approach developed in the International Comparison of Output and Productivity (ICOP) program led by Maddison at University of Groningen.
3 Among the East Asian economies, the most consistent and reliable long-term GDP series going back to the late-19th century are available only for Japan, partly thanks to the efforts of the Long-Term Economic Statistics (LTES) project under the leadership of Kazushi Ohkawa at the Institute of Economic Research of Hitotsubashi University in Japan, leading to a publication of 14 volumes for Japan (an abridged English version by Ohkawa and Shinohara, 1979). The Hitotsubashi group extended

China are sketchy. Solid economic statistics for standard national accounts are only available for the mid 1930s, thanks to the pioneering work on constructing China's GDP for the period 1931-36 by Ou (1947), Liu (1947), Liu and Yeh (1965) and Yeh (1977). We argue that by benchmarking China with the leading regional (Japan) and international (the US) economies where better and longer time series data are available, together with other social and economic information, we may find a sensible way to quantitatively position China. Of course, focusing on one benchmark (currently 1935) is insufficient to anchor the long historical course of China's industrialization that began in the late period of the Qing Empire following the First Opium War, but it is an important starting point.4
Like many production-side PPP studies, the current study concentrates on the manufacturing sector. Although there are generally more data available for manufacturing than for other industries, it is the importance of manufacturing in modern economic development rather than the data availability that is the major motivation behind most studies. Among all industries, manufacturing plays the most important role especially at the early stage of industrialisation. It is the most dynamic sector because manufactured goods have relatively high income elasticity of demand; they are highly tradable and have greater potential to gain from specialisation and economies of scale through trade. Manufacturing growth is also the most important factor behind innovation and hence technological progress. Therefore, as found in many studies, the substantially rising share of manufacturing is almost a universal feature of rapid structural transformation at the early stage of industrialisation (Kuznets, 1971; Chenery, Robinson and Syrquin, 1986).
In addition, a production-side PPP study plays a complementary role in checking any existing expenditure PPP study for the same countries during the same period. In particular, this study may help complement recent studies for Japan/China, Japan/US and China/US in circa 1935 using the expenditure PPP approach (see Fukao, Ma and Yuan, 2007, for example).5 In theory, a country's PPP GDP estimated by expenditure
this line of research to two former Japanese colonies, Taiwan and Korea, with the 1988 publication of a statistical volume compiled by Mizoguchi and Umemura. The volume provides annual estimates of GDP and its various components for these two economies during the period of Japanese occupation based on the detailed economic statistics of the colonial administrations.
4 Such a historical benchmark study is also significant for checking PPP estimates for the modern time Chinese economy. See studies on China/US production PPPs for manufacturing industries by Szirmai and Ren (2000) and Wu (2001).
5 The recent study by Fukao, Ma and Yuan (2007) for the first time constructs expenditure PPPs for Japan/China, Japan/US and China/US for circa 1935. Together with other studies (Fukao, Ma and

and production approach respectively should be the same or at least well reconciled. A production-side PPP study on manufacturing is one important step towards that goal.
This paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we provide a general picture of the economies of China, Japan, Korea and the US in terms of output and employment structures as well as foreign trade by major commodity groups, which serves as a useful background for the whole study. Section 3 presents the standard industry-oforigin PPP approach and discusses the key measurement issues concerned. In Section 4, data sources are provided and problems are discussed for individual countries. In Section 5, we report the estimated PPPs and discuss the results against the background of cost conditions in individual industries between countries in comparison. In Section 6, we apply the estimated PPPs to the cross country output and labour productivity comparisons. Finally, in Section 7 we conclude this study with a discussion of the important implications of our findings.
2. THE CHINESE, JAPANESE, KOREAN AND THE US ECONOMIES IN THE MID 1930S
The selected countries in the current study are fairly representative for different stages of modern economic development. By the mid 1930s, while the US was the world's leading industrial power, just recovered from the Great Depression in 1929-33, the Japanese economy had already undergone a rapid catch up with the West in industrialisation that began during the Meiji period (1868-1912).6 China's modern industrial development was motivated by its consecutive failures in wars with the Western powers since the First Opium War (1840), as well as increasing domestic rebellions,7 but it had been slow and largely defence-oriented. Japan's rising as the major regional military power in response to China's military build up in the 1860s1880s and success in defeating the Qing Imperial Navy in 1894 forced China to speed up its industrialization. However, political and social chaos in the early period of the republican China (from 1911 to the mid 1920s) significantly impeded the course of China's industrial development. By the mid-1930s, which is our benchmark period,
Yuan, 2006; Yuan and Fukao, 2002), this study also extends the expenditure PPP-based international comparison to Taiwan and Korea for the same period.
6 The Meiji Restoration (1868) was the catalyst toward industrialization in Japan that led to the rise of the island nation as a major military power by 1905, under the slogan of "Enrich the country, strengthen the military" (fukoku kyhei). See Ohkawa and Shinohara (1989), Beasley (1995), and Fukao and Saito (2006).
7 Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864) was certainly the most destructive and costly rebellion to the regime. Lesser rebellions at that time include Miao Rebellion (1860-72) and Nien Rebellion (1851-68).
4

China had just enjoyed its ever first "golden decade" of industrialization, but it was still well below the level of Japan can be seen clearly in Table 1.
The Korean economy in our comparison serves as a different reference. Korea underwent its modern industrial development when it was held as the Japanese colony in 1910-1945. However, the Korean development was typically a colonial type concentrating on agricultural and primary resource-based or labour intensive manufacturing that complemented the resource-hungry Japanese economy (see for example, Fukao, Ma and Yuan, 2007; Kim, 2007; Mitsuhiko Kimura, 2008; Mizoguchi and Umemura, 1988,). The integration of the Japanese and Korean economies through colonialism might be one of the main reasons for Korea to grow more rapidly than China (Table 1).

Income Level and Economic Structure
Both the level and the structure of GDP in Table 1 suggest different stages of economic development in the countries in our comparison. The US was the largest economy in total and per capita GDP and left all other economies far behind. In circa 1935, in terms of total GDP measured by market exchange rate, China was 15 percent of the US level, followed by Japan (7 percent) and Korea (1 percent). If measured by per capita GDP (still at market exchange rate), it will more appropriately reflect the stage of development because of the removal of the population effect. As shown in the table, the per capita GDP was $450 for the US, $64 for Japan, $28 for Korea and $18 for China.

researchers (see Ma, 2008, pp. 359-69) adopt the figure as 500 millions from Liu and Yeh (1965). We adopt the estimates by Luo (2000) whose work attempts to adjust the pre-war official estimates to fill gaps in infant and woman statistics, to re-estimate population statistics by the Princeton life-table approach using the 1929-31 survey data and vital statistics, and to include population for Tibet. Inner Mongolia and Manchuria.
All figures measured in US$ in this table are simply converted by the prevailing market exchange rate. In 1935, 1 US$ was equal to 3.43 Japanese Yen and 3.01 Chinese Yuan. Korean Yen = Japanese Yen. Based on Fukao, Ma and Yuan for the average of 1934-36 (2007, Table 8), suggesting a PPP converter as 3.21, 2.23 and 2.36 for China, Japan and Korea, or 31, 45 and 42 percent of the US price level, respectively. Derived from Maddison (2003, pp. 88 and 182), assuming that his estimate of $5,467 for US in constant 1990 GK$ is equivalent to $514 at 1935 prices, and his estimates for other countries relative to the US level are held (i.e. deflated by the same price index). This approach is different from Fukao, Ma and Yuan (2007, see Figure 1 for the same comparisons in 1990 PPP$). Industry compositions of GDP are calculated in nominal terms of national currencies. Industry composition data for Japan is based on net domestic product. See Table 2 for the structure of manufacturing by factory production. Yeh (1977, p.97, Table.1) estimated China's 1935 GDP at 1933 prices. We use weighted agricultural and industrial price indices for 1933-35 to adjust the estimate to 1935 prices.

It is however more sensible to convert these per capita figures into PPPs. By applying the only available bilateral expenditure PPP estimates in Fukao, Ma and Yuan (2007) to the above figures, we can come out with per capita PPP estimates as $143 for Japan, $66 for Korea and $45 for China. It shows that while Japan had already reached to nearly one third of the US level of per capita PPP GDP, China only achieved one tenth of the US level, which was even 30 percent below the Korean level. Here we also compare Fukao-Ma-Yuan estimates with those of Maddison (2003) to show the differences between the two studies.8

The GDP structure of these countries also reflects different stages of economic development. As shown in Table 1, in circa 1935 China had the largest share in agriculture (62.5 percent), followed by Korea (49.0), Japan (18.1) and the US (11.7). In the same period, one forth of the US GDP (25.5) was produced by the industrial sector (manufacturing and mining). By contrast, as the country that experienced the most rapid catch up with the US, 30.3 percent of Japanese GDP came from industry, compared with only 12.3 in Korea and 11.0 percent in China. Furthermore, China's relative inferior position in industrialization is also reflected by the development of the so-called facilitating industries such as utilities and transportation. In circa 1935, only 6.4 percent of the Chinese GDP was produced by the facilitating industries, whereas the share was over 10 percent in both the US and Japan and about 9 percent in Korea.

Manufacturing Structure

The structure of the manufacturing sector in these countries also indicates the different level of development. In Table 2, we first present the share of factory manufacturing in total manufacturing, which indicates to what extent the economy has transformed from traditional to modern manufacturing. We then examine the structure of factory manufacturing among these countries.

Notes:

1) See Table 1 for market exchange rates used for conversion.

2) The share of the factory sector is given in the brackets. See Section 4 for the definition of the

factory sector.

3) Since the employment here is based on numbers employed rather than hours worked, this

estimation should not be taken as a strict measure of labour productivity. See Table 6 for the

conversion of industry level numbers employed into hours worked.

4) Output shares are calculated in national currencies.

As Table 2 shows, the factory share of the US manufacturing was 95.5 percent (as shown in the figures in brackets under manufacturing GVA), compared with 72.3 percent in the case of Japan. Such a difference looks plausible given the stage of their development. Growth is inevitably unbalanced within the manufacturing sector during industrialisation. Empirical studies have found that typically, driven by the significant growth of intermediate demand in total production, investment goods industries are the fastest growing industries, followed by intermediate goods industries and then light industries that mainly produce consumer goods (Nishimizu and Robinson, 1984). Such observations should be confirmed by our country cases in the current study.

7

To help our examination we can roughly reclassify all manufacturing industries into two groups: one that is agricultural or primary resource-based manufactures that largely concentrated on the production of "consumer goods" (including food, textiles, wood and paper products, excluding miscellaneous) which tended to more labourintensive and the other that is mineral-based intermediate materials production and machinery manufacturing that focused on the production of "producer goods" (i.e. including chemicals, building materials, metals and machinery) which tended to be more capital-intensive. The re-grouping shows that the share of "consumer goods" in China and Korea was indeed high, about 66 and 56 percent of the total manufacturing, respectively, whereas the same share in the US and Japan was much lower or 40 and 36, respectively. As for the share of "producer goods", it was low in China (34) and Korea (44), but high in the US (60) and Japan (64). Obviously, the structure of the Chinese and Korean manufacturing was much "lighter" or more labour-intensive than that of the US and Japan because they were still at the earlier stage of industrialization, by contrast, the US and Japanese manufacturing were much "heavier" or capitalintensive.
Furthermore, the structure of the Korean manufacturing does not suggest that Korea was more industrialized than China. Although Korea had smaller "consumer goods" manufacturing than China, 64 percent of the Korean "consumer goods" engaged in "food" whereas in China 65 percent of "consumer goods" were textiles (taking the group total as 100, Table 2). In the case of "producer goods", 37 percent of the Chinese heavy industries engaged in the production of "metals" and "machinery", whereas only 16 percent in the case of Korea. By contrast, 59 percent of the Japanese "producer goods" industries engaged in "metals" and "machinery", even higher than that of the US (55). However, considering the integration of the Japanese and Korean economies, we argue that the overly "heavy" Japanese manufacturing might be complemented by the excessively "light" Korean manufacturing.
Trade Patterns
The history of modern economic development has shown that countries tend to export primary goods to exchange for manufactured goods especially machinery at the early stage of development. Along with industrialization, their exports will become more concentrated on sophisticated manufactured goods and their imports will be mainly primary goods or (simple) manufactured goods that could be produced cheaply in low income countries. This is reflected by the structure of trade of the countries in
8

our comparison for circa 1935. We can divide the commodities traded in Table 3 into three categories: 1) "primary goods" including "food stuff and live animals" and "crude materials, minerals, fuels", 2) "(relatively) simple manufactured goods" that includes all manufactured goods except "machinery and transport equipment", and 3) "sophisticated manufactured goods", that is, "machinery and transport equipment".
As Table 3 shows, with higher level of industrialization compared with China and Korea, the US and Japan exported more manufactured goods than primary goods. It should be noted here that resource endowment plays a role in determining trade patterns. Since the US is relatively resource rich and Japan is excessively resource scarce, the export of primary goods was extremely low in Japan (only 12 percent compared with 40 percent in the US). The case of China and Korea just shows the opposite: 67 percent of the Chinese exports and 76 percent of the Korean exports were primary goods. Again, the Korean case further supports our postulation about the "colonial integration" of the Korean and Japanese economies. It should be noted that China was also an important importer of primary goods (49 percent of total imports). Although China has a much larger territory than Japan, it is not rich in resource endowment on per capita basis; besides, China's poor infrastructure back to the 1930s prohibited lost-cost extraction of natural resources.
Table 3 also shows that 81 percent of the Japanese exports focused on simple or less sophisticated manufactured goods, which looked rather excessive compared with the US (37), China (33) and Korea (23). It is clear that in the mid 1930s, the US was the most important, if not the sole, player in the export of machinery and transport equipment, accounting for 23 percent of its total exports. The Japanese machinery export was about 7 percent of its total exports, whereas only one percent for Korea and nothing for China.

Our review so far has drawn a simple background picture about the economic conditions of the countries in comparison in circa 1935, including their levels of per capita income, patterns of economic structure, patterns of manufacturing structure, and structures of import and export trade. These patterns are in general logically coherent and suggest different comparative advantages of manufacturing industries in these countries, which will be checked later in our PPP exercise comparing the producer prices or factor costs of producing the same product in these countries.
3. METHODOLOGY
Methodologically, we follow the standard approach of constructing the industry-oforigin PPPs developed by the International Comparison of Output and Production Program (ICOP) at University of Groningen led by Angus Maddison (Maddison and van Ark, 1988; van Ark 1993) and its recent practices especially in pre-WWII comparisons including an UK/US comparison by de Jong and Woltjer (2007) and two UK/Germany comparisons by Broadberry and Burhop (2007) and by Fremdling, de Jong and Timmer (2007), all for 1935/36.9
The methodology and data used in sectoral comparisons differ significantly from the standard International Comparison Program (ICP) procedures. While price data for ICP are largely obtained from extensive price surveys conducted in the participating countries, the industry-of-origin approach relies on price data implicit in the censuses of manufacturing. Results of separate price surveys are not systematically used. The product lists and specifications are also drawn from the census data. The aggregation methodology used here is quite simple because there are only bilateral comparisons involving two countries at a time. Largely due to data constraints so that we cannot perform complicated multilateral methods to compute PPPs necessary to convert value aggregates. An important aspect of these productionside PPP comparisons is that along with price data, derived in the form of unit values,
9 Besides, Choi (2006) and Kim, Duol and Park (2007) compared the labour productivity levels of the Japanese and the Korean manufacturing sector in the pre-war period. Their analysis is based on real gross output per worker estimation. Using the approach of Rostas (1948), Yukizawa (1977) compared the labour productivity levels of the Japanese and the U.S. manufacturing sector in the pre-war and the post-war period. Pilat (1994) compared labour productivity levels of the Japanese and the U.S. manufacturing sector for 1939 using his estimates of PPP.

we also have quantity data at the product level. Therefore there is no need to use the concept of basic headings10 which is central to the ICP work.

Let us begin with some basic notations. Let q and p refer to quantity and price, respectively, and superscripts B and X represent the base country and the country to be compared, respectively. Subscript i refers to manufactured product, j refers to the type of industry, and k refers to the type of manufacturing branch, which is equivalent to the 2-digit level "manufacturing industry" used in ISIC.11

In the standard ICOP industry-of-origin studies, prices are in fact unit values

(UVs) as they are derived from data on values (v) and quantities (q) for specific

manufactured

products

or

categories

.

We can obtain unit value ratios (UVRs) by a direct comparison of UVs between two

countries, which can be used in deriving PPPs at the branch and sectoral levels. In the

industry-of-origin approach, a distinction is made between UVRs and PPPs. UVRs

refer to product level price information and PPPs refer to price levels at more

aggregated levels, e.g. from manufacturing industries to branches and to the whole

manufacturing sector.

The production PPPs are derived using a "pyramid" type approach which consists of three steps. The first step involves the derivation of industry-specific PPPs based on prices of manufactured products belonging to a particular industry and aggregated using output or sales quantities as weights. The second step uses these industryspecific PPPs and aggregated to yield branch level PPPs. Finally, the third step uses these branch-level PPPs and aggregated to derive a single PPP for the whole manufacturing sector.

Step I: Industry-specific PPPs
Let pij and qij, respectively, denote the price (=UVij) and quantity of manufactured product i belonging to industry j that is considered to have matching specifications and quality. For all "matched products" which are considered as typical of the industry to which they belong, the PPP for this industry using either country weights are derived as follows:

10 For the purpose of ICP, basic headings are defined as the lowest level of aggregation at which expenditure share weights are available for the purpose of aggregation.
11 In this study's PPP exercise, due to data constraint, we reclassify the 2-digit industries into larger groups within the manufacturing sector.

The Fisher index formula is used to compute PPPs at the industry level. Taking the geometric average of the so-constructed Laspeyres and Paasche indices we can obtain PPP for industry j as a Fisher Index:

(3) PPPjXB(Fisher) = PPPjXB(B) × PPPjXB(X )

The choice of the Fisher index is largely guided by the number of desirable statistical, axiomatic and economic­theoretic properties resulting in labels like the "ideal index" and the "superlative index" (Diewert, 1992).

Step II: Branch Level PPPs
At this stage, the so-constructed j industry level PPPs are aggregated to k branch level PPPs. It is obtained by the weighted average of sample industry PPPs using the gross value of output (GVO) of the sample industries as weights. The following formulas are developed especially to take into account the size effect of industries in aggregation (see van Ark, 1993).
The calculation in this step results in two k level PPPs, one at the quantity weights of the base country or the Laspeyres weights:

Using the same approach to Eq. (3), the Fisher PPP for k branch can be derived as follows:

(6) PPPkXB(Fisher) = PPPkXB(B) × PPPkXB(X )

Step III: Deriving PPP for the Manufacturing as a Whole
The derivation of the PPP for total manufacturing follows a similar approach to Step II whereby PPPs are aggregated from the branch level to total manufacturing using the base country and alternative country branch level weights, respectively. The geometric mean of the so-constructed Laspeyres and Paasche indices finally gives the total manufacturing PPP.
These PPP estimation procedures require detailed product as well as industrylevel data and involve intensive work in matching, weighting and aggregating at different levels. Product specification and quality are essential for unbiased estimation, but in most cases they could only be justified by limited information. Typical data problems are discussed in the nest section.

4. DATA FOR CONSTRUCTING PPPS
Three types of data are used in this study: 1) product data for constructing unit values (UVs) and hence deriving PPPs, 2) sub-industry and industry data for weighting and aggregating in PPP estimation, and 3) value added and employment data for industrylevel productivity analysis. Ideally, at each level the data should be available for "modern" and "traditional" components. In reality, survey or census data only cover the modern sector. In this section, we concentrate mainly on the data that are used in constructing PPPs, including sources, coverage and definition, industrial and sectoral classification, problems and how we deal with the problems. Detailed notes on sources and data handling, often given in technical details, are provided in notes to the tables. Problems on various aggregate data for international comparison are already

14

discussed in Section 2 and the data problems for productivity analysis are handled in Section 6.
Coverage
For the PPP-based direct comparison at industry level, we could only and sensibly cover the "modern" component of each industry in these countries. For the comparison of aggregate economy, wherever possible we cover both the "modern" and "traditional" components and sectors. First of all, we need to report how the "modern" and "traditional" sectors are defined in official statistics of each country, and if there is any problem in terms of compatibility and availability.
It is not surprised to see only the modern sector is recorded in historical statistics. Data on traditional economy are only estimates based on national censuses or limited scope surveys by researchers or authorities. Modern manufacturing in this study is conceptually defined as the production of products that is organized in factories where workers concentrate in a building or buildings to manufacture goods or supervise machines processing one product into another. However, as we can see below, the official criteria for "factory" vary greatly in the early 20th century because of the lack of international coordination in statistical standards.
In the US Biennial Census of Manufactures 1935, "factory" was defined as any enterprise that produced $5,000 or more output a year (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1938, pp. 4-6). By comparing the US census with other sources of official statistics, we have found that over 95 percent (Table 2) of US manufacturing were operated in factories. In the Japanese Census of Factories 1935, it was defined as any enterprise that hired five or more workers and used machine power (Statistical Division of the Ministry of Commerce and Manufacturing Minister's Office, 1937, "Preface", p. 1). In Korea, as explained in the Statistics on Manufactured Products for 1935, a factory was defined as any enterprise that hired at least 10 workers in production (Chosen Government-General, 1937, "Preface"). Despite strong Japanese influence the Korean manufacturing statistics somehow doubled the employment criterion for factories.
In the case of China, its first national industrial census under the leadership of D.K. Lieu (Liu Ta-chün) (NRC, 1937) conceptually followed the Chinese first Factory Law, passed in 192912 that defined a factory as an enterprise that hired at least 30 workers
12 The author and publication date of the Factory Law are unclear. As cited in Pacific Affairs in February 1929 (Vol. 2, No.2, pp. 73-76, Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia), according to a

and also employed machine power. Work on manufacturing by Liu and Yeh (1965) is largely based on Lieu's three-volume survey report. According to the report, the actual survey ended up including many factories that did not meet the Factory Law criteria. Volumes 2 and 3 also report data from those factories that did not meet the Factory Law criteria, but did not process such data seriously and compare them with those that met the criteria. In fact, Lieu's factory survey focused on large firms. The survey was conducted under the National Resource Committee (NRC) that belonged to the Military Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Government. The genuine purpose for the survey was a preparation for China's national defence rather than statistics because large factories could be used for military production. In the current study, our calculations are based on a study by Makino and Kubo (1997) who attempt to adjust Liu and Yeh's estimates using Lieu's survey data. However, Makino and Kubo mainly adjusted Liu and Yeh's estimates for data overlapping and inconsistencies in Lieu's three volumes of survey data but did not attempt to work out estimates taking into account the data from the factories that did not meet the Factory Law criteria.
To check the compatibility of factory criteria among the countries in our comparison we use our PPP estimates in Section 5 and estimates for hours worked and output per worker in Section 6 to calculate the gross value of output (GVO) in 1935 PPPs for an enterprise that meet the minimum criteria for "modern factory" in China, Japan and Korea, respectively. Compared with the $5,000 GVO criterion in the US statistics, the implicit GVO criterion was $6,431 for Japan, $19,389 for China, and $7,356 for Korea.13 If the estimate for China is now assumed to be lowered by two thirds to include the factories below the Factory Law criteria,14 which means 10 workers per factory on constant productivity, it will give an estimate of $6,463, almost the same as the above estimate for Japan. Since the minimum employment
Kuo Min News dispatch from Nanking on December 3, 1928, China's first Factory Law had been drafted by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Labour and discussed by the Legal Commission of the Ministry. According to the citation in the Cambridge History of China, Vol. 12 (Part I) (Footnote 14, p. 42), the Factory Law was issued in 1929. However, the official record shows that the Factory Law was promulgated on December 30, 1932, and published by Commercial Press in Comprehensive Collection of Laws and Regulations of the Republic of China, Volume 3 (1935, pp. 3410-14).
13 We first calculate output in PPPs based on estimates reported in Tables 4, 7 and 8, which give PPP$12,609 for Japan, PPP$30,296 for China and PPP$16,346 for Korea, and we then convert the results to the US dollars by market exchange rate/PPP exchange rate ratios that are also available in Table 4.
14 This assumption is not too strong because only 20 percent of the factories in Lieu's survey could meet the Factory Law standard, i.e. 3,450 out of 18,000 (NRC, 1937).
16

criteria for a Japanese factory is 5 workers, it appears that to produce the same output as in Japan, a Chinese factory had to hire 10 workers whereas a Korean factory has to hire 8.5 workers (implied by 85 percent of minimum $7,356 GVO for Korea). These rough estimates suggest that the underlying minimum output requirement for factories might be quite similar among the three East Asian economies.15 It should be noted that this exercise by no means suggests that factory data of individual countries used in this study can be converted to the same standards; rather it provides useful reference for understanding the estimates.
Industrial Classification
Statistical classification of industries only and inevitably covers factory-based data, excluding traditional activities in manufacturing. In the current study, we classify modern (factory) manufacturing into 9 industries as used firstly in Table 2 and then throughout the study. Our classification is based on the Japanese standard,16 which is largely compatible with the two-digit or some combination of the two-digit industries as defined in ISIC (International Standard of Industrial Classification). As the Korean classification follows the Japanese standard, what we need to do is only to reconcile the Chinese and US data with the Japanese standard. For the US data, this is not a difficult task because they contain detailed data on sub-industries and hence easy for us to check compatibility and to re-classify them into broader industrial groups as used in this study.
There are two main sources for the Chinese data. The first one was China's first national income account constructed by Ou Pao-san during 1941-46, which resulted in a two-volume publication in Chinese in 1947 (Ou, 1947).17 The work concentrated mainly on 1933, reflecting the detailed survey data for that year which had been previously compiled by D.K. Lieu in 1937 (see NRC, 1937). Since Ou's work
15 It would be unrealistic to assume factories in any of these Asian economies were close to the US standard on average in 1935. In fact, the data on US total manufacturing output and employment implies that based on average productivity, a US firm only needed to hire one worker to be qualified as a "factory" in the official statistics, which suggests that the US traditional, non-factory manufacturing had largely disappeared by 1935.
16 There are also some adjustments to the Japanese data. For example, paper industry is included in chemicals in the Japanese classification, which has to be re-classified into paper, printing and publishing industry.
17 See an English-language summary of the work that is published in the Journal of Political Economy (Ou, 1946).
17

followed the western concepts of national income,18 his industrial classification is acceptable. The second source was the work jointly made by two US-based economists Liu Ta-chung and Yeh Kung-chia (1965)19, which subsequently revised Ou's work. Liu-Yeh's estimates raised China's GDP for 1933 by 37 percent, that is, from Ou's 21.77 billion yuan to 29.88 billion yuan at 1933 prices (p.66). The differences between Liu-Yeh and Ou appear to be mainly in agriculture, factory manufacturing and handicrafts. They are basically empirical rather than conceptual differences.
Commodity Data for Constructing PPPs
Following the standard production-side PPP approach, as explained in the methodology section, to derive the relative price of a product (or unit value ratio) between two countries at the same time we need to match the same product between the two countries in comparison and then derive unit value for the product in national currency for each country. This will be an impossible task without detailed census or survey data on manufacturing. Fortunately, by the mid-1930s advanced countries had conducted manufacturing census regularly and some countries at their earlier stages of industrialisation had began such census. For the US, Japanese and Korean data on value and quantity of manufactured products, we rely on the US Bicentennial Census of Manufactures 1935 (US Department of Commerce, 1938), the Japanese Census of Factories 1935 (Statistical Division of the Commerce and Manufacturing Minister's Office, 1937), and the Korean Statistics on Manufactured Products 1935 (Chosen Government-General, 193720). All of these sources refer to our benchmark 1935. We derive unit prices for matched products from these census data.
18 Ou's short bibliography by Trescott (1996) explains how his work was likely highly influenced by the western concepts of national income: "Ou Pao-san went to Harvard for graduate study in 1936 and completed an MA concentrating on agricultural economics. He then spent a year studying in Berlin, visited Cambridge and became acquainted with Piero Sraffa. Returning to Harvard in 1939, he received a strong exposure to Keynes's ideas from Alvin Hansen and Seymour Harris. He perceived the potentialities for national-income estimation after reading Simon Kuznets's work, as well as pioneering studies of the national incomes of Sweden and Hungary. Ou returned to China in 1940 ... [and helped by] five assistants from recent university graduates, [his] national-income project began in 194l and extended until 1946. ... In 1947, support from the Rockefeller Foundation enabled Ou to return to Harvard to complete a PhD. John Black directed his dissertation, which dealt with capital formation and consumers' outlay in China, making use of the national income estimates."
19 Estimates in Yeh (1977) are basically the same as those in Liu and Yeh (1965). However, Yeh provides a time series for 1931-36of which the data for 1935 are used in this study.
20 No official publication date is available. We put "1937" as a guessed publication date because the Japanese census for 1935 was published in 1937.
18

The Chinese data used in this study are, however, not straightforward and hence deserving more detailed explanations. We rely on three sources of data: 1) D.K. Lieu's Report on a Survey of China's Industry, Volume 2 (NRC, 1937); 2) Archive Materials for Studies of Industrial and Agricultural Commodity Prices, Shanghai Volume, compiled by Office for Industrial and Agricultural Price Survey (OIAPS, 1956-57); and 3) Zhen Chen's Study Materials of Industrial History in Contemporary China, Volume 4, Parts 1 and 2 (1961). To derive unit prices of matched products, we make the best use of Lieu's data as reported in Table 4 (Volume 2), referring to products produced by factories that hired at least 30 workers. Lieu's data cannot fully satisfy our needs. The gaps in products are filled or supplemented by the information available in Chen (1961) and in OIAPS (1956). However, both Lieu's and Chen's data are for 1933. To convert prices from 1933 to 1935, we calculate wholesale price indices for 1933-35 using product price data available in OIAPS.
We use gross value of output (GVO) weights to aggregate unit value ratios (UVRs) from product level to sub-industry and then to industry level to derive industry-level PPPs (see Appendix tables for the levels of aggregation). As already mentioned, we based on the Japanese classification to group all manufacturing activities into 9 industries. The US, Japanese and Korean GOV data at industry and sub-industry levels are available from these countries' census data. The Chinese industry and subindustry level GVO data available in Lieu (NRC, 1937) are incomplete. In a study on China's industrial output in 1933, Makino and Kubo (1997) estimated factory output by industry, which conforms to the Japanese standard of industrial classification. Therefore, we use their GVO data as weights in aggregation, supplemented by data from Chen (1961).
5. DISCUSSION OF THE ESTIMATED PPPS
Following the standard methodology for constructing industry-of-origin PPPs, we first conducted three comparisons, namely, China/Japan and Korea/Japan with Japan as the reference country, and Japan/US with the US as the reference country. The details of these comparisons are reported in Appendix Tables A1, A2 and A3, respectively.21 As expected, the coverage ratio between a less developed country and a more developed country can be very different. In the China/Japan comparison, about 72 percent of
21 Table A1 is published in the Appendix as an example for our work in matching producer prices. Due to limited space, Tables A2 and A3 are available on request.
19

Chinese products and 30 percent of Japanese products are covered, and in the Japan/US comparison, the ratio is about 32 percent for Japan and 10 percent for the US. However, in the Korea/Japan comparison, the ratios are very close, 41 and 45 percent, respectively.
In Table 4, to make our PPP estimates easy to follow we use Japan as the bridge country to re-base China and Korea to the US, and report a summary of the US$based PPP estimates and relative price level by industry.

The results in Table 4 show that the PPP for total manufacturing is the highest for China (1.91 yuan/$), followed by Korea (1.54 yen/$) and Japan (1.75 yen/$). Compared with the prevailing market exchange rate (MER), the PPP-implied relative price level for Chinese manufacturing (i.e. yuan PPP divided by yuan MER) is 0.64, suggesting that for the matched manufactured products the cost level (as reflected by producer prices in the comparison) of Chinese manufacturing was 36 percent lower than the US level as suggested by the market exchange rate. By the same calculation, the price level in Korean manufacturing (0.45) and Japanese manufacturing (0.51) was 55 and 49 percent lower than the US price level, respectively.
20

To assess the plausibility of the production PPP estimates, we compare them with the expenditure PPPs in Fukao, Ma and Yuan (2007, Table 4) for China, Japan and Korea in circa 1935 that also use the US as the reference country. It turns out that the production PPP-implied price levels for manufacturing are 100, 13 and 5 percent higher than the expenditure PPP-implied price levels for these countries. Despite such large cross country variations, it is generally in line with what can be predicted by the theory that the non-tradables (included in the expenditure PPPs) in less developed countries tend to be cheaper than the tradables. Fukao, Ma and Yuan (2007) also estimate the price level of the tradables in the final consumption of these countries. In the case of Japan and Korea our production PPP estimates are very close to their results, but this is not the case of China, which is 60 percent higher than the price level for tradables estimated using the expenditure approach.
Theoretically, the price differences between the US and these East Asian economies are just as explained by the Balassa-Samuelson theorem. Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964) argue that because the productivity growth in the non-tradable goods sector is generally and substantially lower than the productivity growth in the tradable goods sector during the development process, there is the secular trend of the prices of non-tradable goods rising relative to the prices of tradable goods. Since the US economy was much more developed and industrialized than other countries in the comparison, such a higher price level in US is expected due to higher cost of the nontradables.
However, two questions have emerged from our production PPP estimates. The first one is why the gap between the PPP-implied price level and the market exchange rate appear to be too large to be in line with the empirical findings in general or what could be predicted by the production PPP theory. Manufactures are generally tradable goods and by nature their PPPs are close to the market exchange rates (see Rao and Timmer, 2003). If no serious sample bias towards low price products in our unit value matching exercise, our tentative conjecture is based on two likely factors: 1) a stronger demand for imports in these East Asian countries than the foreign demand for exports from these countries, hence driving up the exchange rate of foreign currencies (the US dollar) and 2) net capital outflows from these countries that also depreciated domestic currencies. Both deserve a separate research agenda.
Our second question is why China's price level appears to be much higher than the Japanese price level. Our assessment is from two sides. On the one hand, the
21

initial cost of industrialization in China was very high because of the high learning cost ­ China was then unquestionably at the lower portion of the learning curve than Japan. More importantly, the Chinese market for the new manufactured goods was less competitive because of required high initial investment in both physical and human capital which were likely more expensive in China than in Japan.22 On the other hand, the Japanese economy had by then more or less passed the initial stage of industrialization and enjoyed more efficient factor market. Japan's integration with the Korean economy through colonialism might also lower its cost of inputs. Here our focus will be on the recent studies on the comparison of real wages which seem to have lent some support to our conjecture on the low cost of Japanese manufacturing.
Studies by Bassino and Eng (2002) and Bassino (2005) find that daily nominal wages for unskilled workers and carpenters in Tokyo in 1935 were not much higher than those in Bangkok, Singapore, or Penang in British Malaya. As consumer price levels, particularly food prices, were much lower in those Southeast Asian cities, their studies suggest that real wages in Tokyo were lower than in those cities. Bassino's wage data show that the skill premium for carpenters vis-à-vis unskilled workers in Tokyo was smaller than in any of the Southeast Asian cities, indicating the existence of a large pool of skilled workers in Japan in comparison with Southeast Asia.23 This appears to be supported by Godo and Hayami (2003) who reveal that in the 1930s, average years of schooling in Japan were already over 60% of the U.S. level despite the much greater lag in per capita income. Studies by Williamson have shown the cost position of Japan from a different perspective (1998, Table 1 and 2002, Table 3). His estimates suggest that although Japan's wage was higher than Korea and other Asian countries, there was a substantial drop in wage-rental ratio in Japan by 35 percent in 1935-38 from the level of 1930-34, which was not matched in Korea and other Asian countries during the same period.
It is interesting to examine our production PPP estimates for individual industries. It is not surprised to find that "metals" and "machinery" in China, "metals" in Japan, and "food" in Japan and Korea were most expensive to produce. For China, this seems to suggest high learning cost, whereas for Japan and Korea, suggest high cost
22 For example, to make a pair of sport shoes it would cost a Chinese factory 12 yuan but only cost a Japanese factory 9.5 yuan in China (Chen, 1962, p. 700, Table 5).
23 See more discussions on the wage gap between Japan and other countries with supporting data in Bassino and Ma (2005) and Allen et al. (2005).
22

of scarce resources. On the other hand, "textiles" in Japan and Korea, and "building materials" in all the three countries were cheapest compared with those of the US. The case of "textiles" may suggest higher productivity in both Japan and Korea. The case of "building materials" may suggest lower labour costs in all the three countries compared with that of the US. Besides, "building materials" are less affect by prices of international market because they are mainly traded in domestic market and used in construction which is largely non-tradable.
Since the level of economic development in China was closer to that of Japan than to that of the US, and historically, China and Japan were competitors, it would be very meaningful to examine the industry-level PPPs using Japan as the benchmark, which are in fact our primary results (Table A1). After re-basing the PPP results of individual countries to Japan we present the relative price level for each country in total manufacturing and individual industries in Table 5.

First of all, such a re-basing explicitly shows that for the matched products the US price level was higher than that of Japan in all industries. As already pointed out, this is expected because for what could be produced in low income countries the US began to lose comparative advantage, if its productivity level cannot offset its high cost which will be examined next, and move into other higher value added and newly invented more sophisticated manufactures (which of course have no counterparts in the low income economies).

Our focus here is, however, China. In the case of China, almost all industries, except for "food" and "wood", had higher factor costs (reflected by producer prices) than those of Japan. This is not observed in the case of Korea, thanks to its colonial

23

integration with the Japanese economy, the cost of "machinery" in Korea was much lower than in Japan.24 The results for China suggest that the high costs in Chinese modern manufacturing industries made it difficult to compete with foreign manufactured goods as well as with the domestic goods that could be produced with traditional technology. On the other hand, we may also expect that the implicit high profits as suggested by the high prices could be one of the major factors that attracted foreign traders and hence motivated them to lobby for government interventions, including using military power, for the opening up of the China market.

6. COMPARATIVE OUTPUT AND LABOUR PRODUCTIVITY
In this section, we apply the industry-specific PPPs in a cross country comparison of output and labour productivity. Output (in terms of gross value added) in PPPs provides an indicator for the size of an industry relative to the base country. Labour productivity measured as output per hour worked in PPPs reflects the level of capital deepening and the level of efficiency compared with the base country. Compared with the output conversion based on market exchange rate, the two indicators are more proper measures of the level of industrialization in an international comparison framework.
The data work required for deriving these indicators is by no means easier than that required for the price comparisons in constructing PPPs because available historical statistics were not compiled in the concept of value added and data required for estimating value added are insufficient. The data work and results reported below are preliminary and will be finalised when the further improvement is done.

Gross value added in PPPs
There are no gross value added data readily available for any country. Based on the available cost data recorded for factories, we define gross value added (GVA) as gross value of output (GVO) minus the cost of materials (M) and the cost of energy or electricity (E), that is,

24 We find the data for Korea and Japan matching may have some problems. For example, there are huge price differences between the two countries in water tube boilers, steam engines, water turbines, winding machines and pumps blowers (Appendix Table A3 ­ available on request). However, after assuming their prices in the domestic market were the same as export prices, the Korean price level is about 80 percent of the Japanese level. Mismatching in quality and function of these machines could be a problem.

where subscript i indicates industry and superscript F stands for "factory", because only factory data can satisfy data requirement for the estimation. This approach is similar to what used in the Japanese Long-Term Economic Statistics (Ohkawa, Shinohara and Umemura, 1972). To be consistent, we apply the same approach to all countries.
Since it is impossible to have cost break down data for non-factory or handicraft manufactures, we apply value added ratio (VAR) derived from the factory sector to estimate GVA for handicraft manufactures, that is,

(8)

GVAiN

= GVOiN

× VARiF

= GVOiN

× GVAiF GVOiF

.

where the superscript N stands for non-factory or handicraft manufacturing. However, since value added ratio in the handicraft sector may be different from that in the factory sector and the difference may vary across industries, such a treatment may distort the real GVA and labour productivity for some handicraft industries, hence industries as a whole (factory plus handicraft). This is certainly an area that deserves further research.25

For the factory sector, the Japanese manufacturing GVA by industry are estimated based on data from the Census of Factories 1935 (Statistical Division of the Commerce and Manufacturing Minister's Office, 1937, pp. 20-40), the US manufacturing GVA by industry are estimated using data from the Bicentennial Census of Manufactures 1935 (US Department of Commerce, 1938, pp. 22-38.), and the Korean manufacturing GVA by industry are based on data constructed by Kim for 1935 (2008, p. 111).

The case of China is a bit more complicated as explained in Section 4. The most important information is from China's first factory census conducted by Lieu (NRC, 1937). Lieu's census intended to cover all factories as defined by Factory Law, i.e. enterprises that hired 30 or more workers and used machine power. However, the census went beyond the original scope to include enterprises with less than 30 workers. This was because in most locations there were many enterprises that could

not satisfy the Factory Law criteria. The number of factories participated the census was eventually over 18,000, of which 3,450 met the Factory Law standard. The total number is not certain because there are some overlapping of the two categories as detected by Makino and Kubo (1997). In this study we directly use the revised data from Makino and Kubo.
Table 6 first presents the so-constructed GVA data in national currencies for individual manufacturing industries and then converts the data to PPPs reported in Table 4. To include the handicraft manufacturing, in the lower panel of Table 6 we report GVA for individual industries as a whole (factory plus handicraft). Besides, to compare with the US, in the last column of each country panel, a country/US index is provided for all industries.
It shows that for the factory sector, the size of Japanese manufacturing was 12 percent of the US level in PPP terms, whereas for China and Korea it was only 1 and 0.6 percent, respectively. However, given China's size and extremely uneven development across regions, it is useful to bear in mind that in the mid 1930s the socall "lower Yangtze" (Shanghai, Nanjing, Jiangsu and Zhejiang) produced 66 percent of total factory output in China proper (excluding Manchuria) (see Ma, 2008, Appendix Table 2).
If putting factory and handicraft manufactures together, the size of Japanese manufacturing raised to 16.6 percent of the US level, whereas for China the ratio increased to 10.9 percent of the US level, for Korea it is basically unchanged. (The coverage of the available data for the Korean handicraft sector is apparently insufficient. Yet it is difficult to gauge with available information.)
It is also meaningful to examine the industries in each country that were distinctly larger than the relative size to the US for the manufacturing as a whole. If excluding "building materials" (highly non-tradable), they were "textiles" in China; "textiles" and "chemicals" in Japan; and "food" and "chemicals" in Korea. Note that fertilisers were one of the main "chemicals" products in Japan and Korea that were used for farm production (food and textiles), which explains why "chemicals" were relatively larger in size.

Hours worked
Numbers employed can be very different from hours worked. It is due to institutional and political factors such as laws and regulations and labour unions, labour market conditions that are related to demand and supply factors, nature of industry, i.e. level of safety or heath hazard, as well as culture or tradition that developed in history because of climate conditions and farming customs. Since these factors and conditions vary greatly among countries, it is important to convert numbers employed to hours worked in international comparison.
In the current study, data on working hours for Japan, Korea and the US are directly adopted either from government statistics or other studies. The Japanese working hours in manufacturing for 1935 are obtained from the government Handbook of labour statistics complied by the Statistical Division of Cabinet Office (1935, pp. 96-99). The Korean working hours in manufacturing for 1939 are obtained from Chosen Government-General, Statistics on Manufactured Products (1941, pp: 45). As for the US data on working hours, we use estimates by de Jong and Woltjer (2007, p. 23, Table 5).
The Chinese data on working hours are not straightforward. The 1935 issue of China Economic Annals, compiled by the Ministry of Industry (1935, pp. Q13-16), is perhaps the only official publication that colleted almost all then available surveys on working hours and working days in China in different industries and regions over the period 1932-34. Based on the data from these surveys, we estimate total and average annual working hours for individual industries for circa 1935.
The results are reported in Table 7. It indeed shows that annual hours worked per person were very different among these countries and across industries. On average, the Korean manufacturing workers worked 2,431 hours per year, compared with 2,807 hours in China and 3,132 hours in Japan, which were 34, 54 and 72 percent higher than the US of 1,817 hours, respectively. Intuitively, the working hours in Japan might be overestimated whereas in the US might be underestimated. Some studies have found that long working hours in Japan were indeed a long tradition and only changed very recently (ref, Japan Industrial Productivity Database-JIP2008). On the other hand, the estimation for the US by de Jong and Woltjer (2007) seems too low. If using the standard of eight hours per working day and six days per week, the
28

average US manufacturing workers only worked for 38 weeks, by contrast the Japanese had to work for 65 weeks a year!
If taking a closer look at some industries in China and Korea, our findings suggest that the long working hours in Japanese manufacturing might not be impossible. In the case of "chemicals" in China the average annual working hours per worker were 3,167, even slightly more than the Japanese average. In the case of "wood" in Korea, it was 3,097, very close to the Japanese average, but in the case of Korean "paper" industry, it was as high as 3,690 or 18 percent more than the Japanese average working hours. Therefore, if the estimates for Japan, China and Korea are plausible for circa 1935, the estimates by de Jong and Woltjer (2007) for the US may be too low and hence may exaggerate the labour productivity in the US in 1935.

Labour productivity in PPPs Based on the estimates for gross value added in Table 6 and hours worked in
Table 7, we can easily calculate labour productivity in PPPs in Table 8. Note that the estimates are only for the factory sector. To compare with the US labour productivity, we can also calculate relative labour productivity for China, Japan and Korea with the US as the reference (= 1). It shows that on average, the Japanese and Korean labour productivity in manufacturing in 1935 was very close, or PPP$0.30 and 0.28 per hour, respectively, whereas China was only 0.09 PPP$ per hour. In relative terms, in 1935 the labour productivity in Japanese and Korean manufacturing was about 23-24 percent of the US level (= $1.24 per hour), whereas the labour productivity in Chinese manufacturing was less than 7 percent of the US level. Clearly, even if there were underestimation of the hours worked in the US manufacturing, it may not change the pattern significantly. Given all other indicators for the level of economic development, especially per capita income, we feel that the Japanese labour productivity would not be more than one third of the US level in any case, which gives a useful reference for assessing the level of other economies.
At the industry level in individual countries, it shows that some industries enjoyed higher labour productivity than others as compared with the country average. Importantly, in Japan, we find almost all heavy or "producer goods" industries (i.e. "chemicals", "building materials", "metals" and "machinery") had higher labour productivity than light or "consumer goods" industries, suggesting heavy industries had already played a major role at that stage of Japan's industrialization. This was, however, neither in the case of China nor Korea. In China, only "wood" and "building materials" enjoyed better labour productivity than the manufacturing average, whereas in Korea only "food" and "chemicals" enjoyed better labour productivity than the manufacturing average. The findings reflect different stages of economic development in these countries and are in line with our findings on relative prices for individual industries.

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Following the standard methodology for measuring industry-of-origin or productionside PPP, this study compares the unit values of manufacturing products in China, Japan, Korea and the United States, derives unit value ratios (UVRs) and hence estimates relative price levels for individual manufacturing industries in circa 1935 with the US as the reference country. Unlike the expenditure PPP approach, this production approach allows us to more rigorously examine the pre-WWII economic conditions in East Asia from the production side in terms of producer costs and labour productivity in manufacturing relative to those in the US.
Based on estimated production PPPs as well as estimated gross value added and hours worked for these countries, we find that in circa 1935 the producer price level in China, Japan and Korea was 64, 51 and 45 percent of the US level in manufacturing the same products as implied by the prevailing market exchange rates of these countries' currencies against the US dollar, but the labour productivity in these countries was only 7, 24 and 23 of the US level, respectively. Apparently, the higher price level in the US is justified by its much higher labour productivity implying more advanced technology. However, a comparison among the three East Asian countries reveals some inconsistencies. Japan and Korea had almost the same productivity and their producer price levels were close. By contrast, China's productivity was not much more than one third of the level of Japan and Korea but had a much higher price level than that of Japan and Korea. Such a striking finding for China raises two challenging questions: Did Chinese manufacturing produce in line with its comparative advantage? If not, what drove China's earlier industrialization?
Let us think about the first question. In order to understand price gaps and comparative advantage, we need to assume that Japan's exports and China's exports were not perfect substitutes. Even if China's prices were higher than Japan's, China could still export substantial amount of textiles if they were cheaper in comparison with the world average prices. To properly explain price level gaps, we need to take into account two factors, factor cost and the level of technology (as reflected by labour productivity, input/output ratio of intermediate inputs, and unit capital cost). China's factor costs might be much higher than those in Japan. Since China's per capita GDP was about one third of the Japanese level (Table 1), it is reasonable to assume that China's wage level might be one half of the Japanese level. If China's
33

labour productivity in textiles was one third of the Japanese level (Table 8), then China's unit labour cost or wage-labour productivity ratio must be 50 percent higher than that of Japan. On the other hand, China's unit intermediate input cost could also be higher than that in Japan because of higher prices of cotton yarns and inefficient production process. Therefore, we can expect that China's price level of textiles would be higher than that in Japan.
The Heckscher-Ohlin theory usually assumes identical technology, but in the 1930s the technology level was very different as discovered in Table 8. If we consider the factor cost differences and technological differences simultaneously, we can expect that China's comparative advantage mainly existed in primary industries and labour-intensive products including some types of textiles and garments. Table 3 shows that China's net exports mainly concentrated in crude materials, minerals, fuels as well as textile products, which are very consistent with our conjecture.
Let us now turn to our second question what might drive China's earlier industrialization if it was indeed costly as suggested by our cost comparisons. Countries begin their modern economic development at different times, which means that late comers may face very different conditions from the pioneers which enjoy first-mover advantage even if the initial resource endowments are the same. When some countries have already industrialized or developed with modern technologies and industries, less developed countries tend to pursue a state-supported take-off or even some non-market approach for industrialization. This is because to many less developed countries comparative advantage is equivalent to cheap labour and land which, as some believe, would not easily lead to a fast catch up with developed countries. History has indeed shown us that large developing countries might use their comparative disadvantage to catch up though seldom efficient and successful.
Small countries in modernization seek to maximize their benefits by using their comparative advantage (niche services or unique natural resources) to pay for manufactured goods made in advanced countries because developing capital goods industries is inefficient due to diseconomies of scale. Small countries may also seek political-military allies so that they do not have to develop their own defence-oriented heavy industries. Large countries are different. Their potentially huge domestic markets attract those domestic investors who could afford for the high initial costs of learning and imitating, though they usually require state support. Politicians in such countries tend to have strong incentives to lend support or to pursue a state-involved
34

industrialization because of political returns and national defence pressures. Some countries may rely on political support or state power to develop capital goods manufacturing and R&D while using their comparative advantage to pay for the cost, whereas some may go extreme by adopting forced saving and hence forced heavy industrialization through totalitarian controls and central planning like what happened in the Soviet Union and the Maoist China.
Our costs and productivity analyses have suggested that China did not produce in its comparative advantage, which lends tentative support to our conjecture. On the one hand, China's huge potential market was attractive to investors who could afford for initial high costs due to underdeveloped market institutions and infrastructures for modern industries. On the other hand, government involvement in China's initial development of heavy industries was inevitable because of the treats of foreign powers including its neighbour Japan as well as political and military conflicts at home.
