Physical activity engagement during physical education is important for many reasons, including developing physical fitness and movement skills and promoting health. Much more is known about physical activity in elementary than secondary schools. We examined physical activity and how it was influenced by instructor-related and environmental characteristics during 238 lessons taught by 65 physical education specialists in 30 randomly selected secondary schools in Hong Kong. Trained observers used SOFIT (System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time) in randomly selected grade 7­12 classes over a 6-month period. Results showed students engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) about 35% of lesson time, a level similar to that found in U.S. elementary schools and short of the U.S. Healthy People 2010 objective of 50% engagement time. Multiple regression analyses found that six potentially modifiable variables contributed to 35% of the variability in lesson MVPA percent.

Physical activity engagement has been identified as an important goal of physical education in the United States (National Association for Sport and Physical Education [NASPE], 2004) and most other countries (Puhse & Gerber, 2005; World Health Organization [WHO], 2004). With the rapidly growing worldwide obesity and Type 2 diabetes rates (Koplan, Liverman, & Kraak, 2005), engaging in physical activity is becoming even more critical because it contributes to both the current and future health of children (Strong et al., 2005). National and international recommendations for physical activity and health promotion and disease

prevention in children typically call for school-age children to participate daily in 60 min or more of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) that is developmentally appropriate, enjoyable, and involves a variety of activities (Strong et al., 2005; USDHHS/USDA [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services / U.S. Department of Agriculture], 2005). Some children, such as those at risk for overweight or diabetes, may need more than 60 min per day to maintain or regain adequate health status.
The recommended physical activity minutes can be accumulated through the day and obtained in a variety of settings, but physical education classes are especially important venues for physical activity because they are usually required, reach nearly all children, and are led by trained professionals (Pate et al., 2006; Sallis & McKenzie, 1991). Many children, particularly those from poor families and rural areas, do not have access to physical activity programs outside of school (Lee, 2005). In addition, school physical education is one of only five interventions strongly recommended for increasing physical activity by the national Task Force on Community Preventive Service (Kahn et al., 2002).
There is recent interest in studying physical activity from an ecological perspective (e.g., Elder et al., 2007), including those environmental factors that might influence physical activity in physical education (Chow, McKenzie, & Louie, 2008). Physical activity is always contextual, and using direct observation to assess it has the advantage of simultaneously recording activity levels along with contextual influences, including physical and social environmental factors. One observation tool, the System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time (SOFIT; McKenzie, Sallis, & Nader, 1991), is widely used, and its activity codes have been validated for use with both elementary (Rowe, Schuldheisz, & Van der Mars, 1997) and high school students (Rowe, Van der Mars, Schuldheisz, & Fox, 2004) through heart rate monitoring.
Studies using SOFIT and other measurement techniques have found that the proportion of time students spend in MVPA during physical education lessons is limited compared with the U.S. Healthy People 2010 (USDHHS, 2000) target of 50% of lesson time (Fairclough & Stratton, 2005a; 2006). For example, third grade children in over 800 schools in the U.S. National Institute of Early Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study (2003) engaged in MVPA only 37% of lesson time. In that study, smaller class sizes and lessons held outdoors were associated with increased student activity. In contrast, a study of physical education in a representative sample of elementary schools in Hong Kong found children's activity levels to meet the 50% MVPA standard (Chow et al., 2008). In addition to outdoor lessons being more active than those held indoors, Hong Kong children's physical activity levels were positively associated with hotter temperatures, having a larger instructional space, and numerous modifiable teacher behavior and lesson context variables.
Fewer studies of physical activity during physical education have been conducted in secondary schools than in elementary schools (Fairclough & Stratton, 2005a; 2006; Stone, McKenzie, Welk, & Booth, 1998). Nonetheless, adolescence is a critical time for physical activity accrual, with physical activity levels declining in girls substantially faster than those in boys (Trost et al., 2002). Gender differences in physical activity during secondary school physical education have been investigated, but results are equivocal (Fairclough & Stratton, 2005a). In the

Physical Activity During Secondary School PE 23
Middle School Physical Activity and Nutrition studies, boys were found to be more active than girls overall and specifically during skill drills, game play, and free play (McKenzie, Marshall, Sallis, & Conway, 2000), and boys-only and coeducational classes provided more MVPA than girls-only classes (McKenzie, Prochaska, Sallis, & LaMaster, 2004). Fairclough and Stratton (2005a) have suggested, however, that the type of activities that the genders engage in might contribute to these differences, with the subject matter of girls-only lessons producing lower activity levels than the content of boys-only lessons.
The school physical environment can be a significant factor influencing both the quality and quantity of physical education. Specific to Hong Kong, limited activity space and large class sizes could affect physical activity levels. Accruing physical activity in physical education is critically important in Hong Kong because overcrowding, lack of outdoor facilities, and the standard high-rise housing provide limited opportunities for physical activity outside of school. To fulfill the guidelines set by the government's education board (i.e., 5­8% of the total curriculum time allocated for physical education lessons, Hong Kong Curriculum Development Council, 2002), most secondary schools schedule two physical education lessons per week, for a total of 70­80 min. To date, baseline levels of physical activity during physical education in these schools have not been established. The purposes of this study were to (a) measure student physical activity, lesson context, and teacher behavior during physical education lessons in a representative sample of secondary schools in Hong Kong and (b) assess the influence of class gender composition and other environmental factors (e.g., lesson location, activity area size, class size) on students' physical activity levels during those lessons.
Methods
Schools Observations were conducted in 30 secondary schools in Hong Kong from December 2005 to May 2006. The sample represented 6% of Hong Kong's 469 government and government-aided secondary schools, and the random selection of schools was based initially on stratification by school type (coeducational, boysonly, girls-only) and then by region (Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, New Territories). The final sample included 6% of coeducational schools (22 of 388), 10% of boys-only schools (4 of 40), and 10% girls-only schools (4 of 41). By region, the percentages of participating schools were: Hong Kong Island, 3% (3 of 91); Kowloon, 8% (13 of 162); and 6 New Territories, 6% (14 of 216). All research procedures were approved by the university research committee, and consent to observe classes was provided by school principals and physical education teachers. Data Collection Observation Schedule. A total of 123 randomly selected intact classes participated, with observations for each class scheduled to take place on two randomly selected days during the 6-month period. To account for seasonal and curricular diversity, observation days were arranged by two cycles (winter, spring/summer)

24 Chow, McKenzie, and Louie
with each class observed once during each cycle. Lessons cancelled because of either inclement weather or special activities were rescheduled. Teachers were informed of school visitations, but they were asked to deliver their normal lesson content and instruct in their usual manner. Teachers were not fully aware of the specific categories being coded. SOFIT Instrument. SOFIT uses direct observation to simultaneously record student activity levels, lesson context, and teacher behavior. The development and protocol of SOFIT have been described in numerous other studies and the activity codes have been validated with children using heart rate monitoring (McKenzie et al., 1991; Rowe et al., 1997, 2004) and accelerometry (Scruggs et al., 2003). During SOFIT coding, the observed activity of four randomly selected students was categorized using momentary time sampling. Codes 1­4 described the observed student's body position (lying down, sitting, standing, walking), and Code 5 (vigorous) identified when the student was expending more energy than that of normal walking. Every 20 s, the lesson context was coded into one of six categories to represent how the lesson was being delivered: management, knowledge, fitness, skill practice, game play, or free play. Teacher behavior was also coded to indicate what the instructor was doing during the observation interval: fitness promotion, fitness demonstration, general instruction, management, observation, and off-task. Guidelines for observer training and data collection using the instrument were based on the technical descriptions of the SOFIT training manual (McKenzie, 1998). Teachers' Rating of Student Physical Activity Levels. At the end of each observed lesson, teachers were asked (a) to estimate the percentage of their students being active (walking/running) during the majority of the lesson and (b) to rate the average intensity of student physical activity during class on a 10-point scale (1 = extremely low; 10 = extremely high). School Environment Measures. To determine the possible influence of environmental conditions on student physical activity, the following were recorded: class size (count of students present during lesson), lesson location (outdoors [typically on a hard-surfaced court], indoors [typically a covered activity space], or both areas), weather condition (sunny, cloudy, rainy), air temperature (degrees Celsius), relative humidity (%), and size of instructional area (m2). Observer Training and Reliability. Two observers were trained by an experienced SOFIT investigator who also conducted the field reliability measures. Coders participated in 10 hr of training, which included videotaped assessments and live practice sessions. Actual data collection began only after interobserver agreement, IOA = [#agreements  (#agreements + #disagreements)  100], exceeded 85% on all three major categories. During subsequent field reliability checks, the observer and the criterion coder independently scored variables while being paced by MP3 audio signals through two connected earphone jacks. Sixteen lessons were coded for reliability over the 6-month period (8 during each cycle). Overall, IOAs were 94%, 93%, and 86% for student activity level, lesson context, and teacher behavior, respectively.

Data Analyses SOFIT is a lesson-level measure. The lessons of 123 different intact classes were scheduled to be observed twice across one school year, but 8 classes (6.5%) could be observed only once. With different students being observed during each lesson and the lesson context and teacher behavior differing each time, data were aggregated into 238 lessons for analysis. Lesson MVPA percent was obtained by adding the proportion of lesson time students spent walking and being vigorous. It provided a summary measure of physical activity engagement during lessons and served as the main dependent variable. Independent variables reflected two general categories: environmental and instructional. Environmental variables included lesson location, weather condition, air temperature, and humidity. Instruction-related variables included teacher gender, class composition (boys-only, girls-only, coeducational), class size, size of instructional space per student, teachers' perception of proportion of students in activity, teachers' perception of student activity intensity, lesson content, lesson context variables, and teacher behavior variables. (The footnotes to Table 3 provide explanations of variables.)
Descriptive analyses (means, standard deviations) in percentages and minutes of class time were calculated for each SOFIT subcategory. Version 14.0 of SPSS/PC (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used for all inferential statistical tests and 0.01 was set as level of significance to control for experiment-wise error rate. Analyses of variances were computed for mean differences in lesson length and MVPA percent among three class gender composition groups (boys-only, girlsonly, coeducational), and when significant differences were found Newman­Keuls post hoc analyses were conducted. MVPA percent did not differ significantly by class grade; therefore, grade level was not used in subsequent analyses. MVPA percent differed by class gender composition (given in Tables 1 and 2), so class composition was controlled as an additional independent variable in Univariate General Linear Model analyses for MVPA percent differences in groups based on instructor-related and environmental characteristics. Pearson correlations were used to assess relationships between MVPA percent and each SOFIT subcategory as well as between MVPA percent and environmental variables. Multiple linear regression analyses by both block entry of environmental and instruction-related variables and stepwise methods were used to determine predictors of MVPA percent to account for both block and individual variables. Before entering regression analysis, procedures for checking violations of assumptions (normality, linearity, equality of variance) were conducted.
Results
General A total of 238 lessons, averaging 15.8 per school (SD = 5.5) and taught by 65 physical education specialists (38 men, 27 women), were observed (63 seventh grade, 49 eighth grade, 62 ninth grade, 42 tenth grade, 6 eleventh grade, 16 twelfth grade). More junior- (grades 7­9) than senior-level (grades 10­12) lessons were observed because (a) schools had more junior-level classes and (b) grade 11

classes were occasionally unavailable because of required public examinations. Class size ranged from 5 to 55 students, with an average of 32.8 (SD = 9.01).
Mean scheduled lesson length was 73.2 min, ranging from 35 to 120 min. Mean actual (and observed) lesson length (i.e., instructional time), however, was 16.1 min shorter (22.0%), ranging from 19 to 100 min. The actual length for boysonly (M = 55.5 min, SD = 14.6; 92 lessons), girls-only (M = 58.3 min, SD = 14.4; 108 lessons, and coeducational (M = 57.6 min, SD = 14.8; 38 lessons) classes did not differ significantly, F(2, 235) = 0.94, p = .39.
All boys-only lessons (n = 96) were taught by men. Males also taught 20% of the girls-only lessons (i.e., 22 of 108) and 53% of the coeducational lessons (i.e., 20 of 38). Instructors' mean age was 34.4 years (SD = 8.5), and they had an average teaching experience of 12.0 years (SD = 8.4). The average size of the instructional area used during lessons was 646 m2, ranging from 32 to 7130 m2. Nearly half the lessons (48%) were taught outdoors, 21% were held indoors, and 31% used both spaces. Weather conditions were varied (sunny, 47%; cloudy, 38%; rainy, 15%), with air temperature ranging from 10 to 31 °C (mean = 21 °C) and relative humidity ranging from 43% to 98% (mean = 79%).
Teachers estimated that 64% of students in the class (SD = 6%) engaged in MVPA during most of their observed lesson and estimated average student physical activity intensity to be 6.0 (SD = 2.0) on a 10-point scale. Teacher perceptions of the proportion of students they estimated to be engaged in physical activity was positively associated with the objectively assessed MVPA percent measures (r = .14, p = .03). Overall Student Physical Activity and Class Gender Composition Table 1, which presents the proportion of lesson time and number of minutes for the main SOFIT categories (student activity, lesson context, and teacher behavior) overall and by class composition, shows that there was substantial variability among lessons. Overall, students spent the greatest proportions of lesson time standing (46%) and walking (24%). On average, they accrued 5.9 min of vigorous physical activity (VPA; 10% of lesson) and 19.8 min of MVPA (34.8% of lesson).
Boys-only lessons provided 1.5 min more MVPA than girls-only lessons (21.0 vs. 18.5 min), and the intensity of physical activity they provided was significantly higher, F(2, 235) = 6.45, p = .002 (MVPA = 38.2 vs. 31.8% of lesson). Students in coeducational classes engaged in MVPA 35.3% of lesson time. The major differences between boys-only and girls-only lessons were in the proportion of lesson time that students spent standing (boys-only, 41%; girls-only, 51%) and walking (boys-only, 27%; girls-only, 22%). Subject Matter Content and Lesson Context The primary instructional content of the lessons included 33 different activities or themes. Table 2 presents the actual lesson length and MVPA percent for the 12 most frequently occurring content areas by class gender composition. While the number of classes is insufficient for a complete statistical analysis, the means and

standard deviations show that MVPA percent varied substantially by class gender composition and content areas, as well as among lessons having the same content. For example, MVPA percent was high during lessons focusing on distance running during fitness testing (64.0%), free play activities (53.6%), and circuit training (46.2%). In contrast, MVPA levels were low during golf (21.1%), long jumping (22.2%), and shot put (26.4%) lessons. Boys-only basketball lessons provided higher MVPA percent than girls-only basketball lessons (41.5 vs. 33.6%), but MVPA levels in boys-only and girls-only volleyball classes were similar (30.9 vs. 31.1%).
Overall, the largest proportion of lesson time was allocated to skill practice (37%), fitness activities (19%), knowledge (15%), and management (14%). Time was allocated for management, knowledge, fitness activities, and skill development in nearly all lessons, but only 42% of lessons included game play and 13% had free play. A larger proportion of time was allocated for game play in boysonly (18%) than in coeducational (9%) or girls-only (8%) lessons.
Environmental and Instruction-Related Variables MVPA percent was not significantly related to lesson location, weather condition, temperature, and class size. Table 3 shows MVPA percent means for selected environmental and instruction-related characteristics. MVPA percent was greater in lessons in which teachers used a large activity space per student, implemented a highly active subject matter, reduced lesson time for knowledge, and increased lesson time for promoting fitness activity while reducing time for skill instruction and increased time for observation.
Teachers spent about 55% of lesson time providing instruction, followed by managing the class (24%), observing (11%), and demonstrating fitness (9%). Rarely (i.e., about 20 s per lesson) were they involved in tasks not related to class instruction. Teachers spent relatively more time observing in boys-only lessons (17%) than in either coeducational (9%) or girls-only (6%) lessons. Conversely, teachers spent relatively more time in managing (29 vs. 18%) and demonstrating fitness (12 vs. 7%) in girls-only than in boys-only lessons. MVPA percent was higher in lessons instructed by men (36.5% vs. 32.7%), but the results for teacher gender were confounded by the student gender composition of classes and the lesson subject matter content.

(r = .04), class size (r = -0.13), and lesson length (r = .07) were not significantly related to MVPA percent; however, air temperature (r = .14; p = .04) and relative size of activity area (r = .29, p = .00) were. MVPA percent was negatively associated with the lesson context of knowledge (r = -0.29, p = .00) and the proportion of time teachers spent providing general instruction (r = -0.31, p = .00). In contrast, MVPA percent was positively associated with lesson time allocated for game play (r = .33, p = .00) and fitness activities (r = .17, p = .00) as well as the proportion of lesson time teachers spent observing (r = .38, p = .00).
Multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the relative contributions of block variables found to be significantly related to MVPA percent. Two blocks of variables (i.e., environmental and instruction related) predicted a total of 41% of the variability in lesson MVPA percent (data not shown). A further stepwise multiple regression analysis (Table 4) found six variables to make significant contributions to MVPA percent: lesson context of knowledge (14% of explained variance), lesson content (6%), size of space used per student (4%), class gender composition (4%), the teacher behavior of instruction (3%), and the lesson context of management (3%).
Discussion
This study is the first territory-wide investigation of physical education in a representative sample of secondary schools in Hong Kong. The findings from a total of 238 lessons from 30 secondary schools taught by 65 physical education specialists paint a realistic picture of physical education in the region. In addition, the study is one of the few large-scale investigations undertaken to use direct observation techniques to examine potential environmental influences on the physical activity of adolescents in secondary school physical education. The observation procedures not only permitted a direct assessment of the physical environment in which physical education was conducted, but also provided an objective method to verify the simultaneous occurrence of student physical activity levels, the subject matter provided, how it was delivered, and how teachers themselves behaved

during lessons. The study follows an earlier investigation of physical education in randomly selected elementary schools in Hong Kong (Chow et al., 2008), and it investigates the same environmental factors explored in that study. Student Physical Activity Levels Overall, secondary school students in Hong Kong spent approximately 35% of lesson time in MVPA, far short of U.S. Healthy People 2010 (USDHHS, 2000) recommendation of 50%. They were less active than students observed during physical education in Hong Kong elementary (Chow et al., 2008) and special schools (Sit, McManus, McKenzie, & Lian, 2007). Their activity levels, however, were similar to those of students in the United States observed using the same SOFIT instrument, including third graders in the baseline study (36%; McKenzie et al., 1995), third graders in 10 U.S. states (37%; NICHD, 2003), and middle school girls at baseline (38%, McKenzie et al., 2006). Their activity levels were also similar to those of high school students in England, who were measured using heart rate monitoring (Fairclough & Stratton, 2005b). As in other studies, the physical activity levels of the Hong Kong secondary school students varied substantially during lessons (see Table 1), which reflects the influence of numerous contextual and pedagogical factors (Stratton, 1996).
Actual lesson length was 22% shorter (57.1 vs. 73.2 min) than scheduled length, an amount similar to that found both in Hong Kong elementary schools (Chow et al., 2008) and U.S. middle schools (McKenzie et al., 2000). Students accrued an average of 5.9 min of vigorous physical activity and 19.8 min of MVPA (10% and 34.8% of actual lesson time, respectively) during an individual lesson. With lessons scheduled only twice per week, physical education fell far short in helping students meet physical activity recommendations (currently a total of 60 min per day) (Strong et al., 2005). Increasing physical education to five days per week would help students meet recommended standards, but even with this new policy students would need to accrue additional time for physical activity in other settings (e.g., intramural, club, and other programs). Class Gender Composition A U.S. middle school study found students in boys-only classes accrued 5.8 min more MVPA (19.2 vs. 13.4 min) than those in girls-only classes (McKenzie et al., 2004). Fairclough and Stratton (2005a) have argued that physical activity in girlsonly lessons may be lower due to the inclusion of more aesthetic and movementbased activities whereas boys' lessons include more team games. In the current study, students in boys-only classes accrued an average of 1.5 MVPA min per lesson more than those in girls-only lessons (21.0 vs. 18.5 min), with those in coed classes being in between (20.4 min). Given the vast number of main lesson themes (i.e., 33), however, we were unable to detect physical activity differences by types of activities as a function of gender composition. Hannon and Ratliffe (2005) have suggested that teacher interaction rates and team sport preferences rather than class gender composition might contribute to the main differences in activity levels in physical education. Indeed, we found that teachers in boys-only classes spent more time observing and less time managing and demonstrating

34 Chow, McKenzie, and Louie
fitness (i.e., provided fewer teacher interactions) than teachers in girls-only classes. Further study is needed to investigate the relationship between teachers' active instructional practices and student activity levels. Subject Matter Content and Lesson Context Although a limited number of lessons for specific subject matter themes prohibited a thorough statistical analysis, the results concur with previous investigations (Chow et al., 2008; Fairclough & Stratton, 2005b), and suggest that the physical activity levels of students during physical education vary substantially with the lesson subject matter (see Table 2). Students in soccer, basketball, and badminton lessons, for example, were substantially more active than those in gymnastics lessons. Teachers wanting to provide students with substantial amounts of physical activity might take into consideration the sport or movement themes they offer.
Along the same line, activity levels differ during various lesson contexts (McKenzie et al., 2000; 2006), and an additional possibility for increasing physical activity is to modify how the selected subject matter is delivered. Fitness activities typically provide the most MVPA, whereas knowledge provides the least (McKenzie et al., 2000; 2006). The determination of how physical education is delivered, however, goes far beyond solely considering physical activity engagement. Physical education has many additional objectives, including the development of physical fitness and motor skills (which do require physical activity), as well as knowledge dissemination and the development of social and emotional skills, which are sometimes best taught when students are sedentary. Environmental Influences Environmental conditions have the potential to influence physical education in many ways, including what subject matter can be offered, when it is taught, and how it is arranged. In the current study, weather conditions (sun, clouds, rain), temperature, and humidity were not associated with MVPA during lessons. These conditions, however, may have influenced unmeasured factors, such as whether a sport or movement theme was offered at all or during what time of year it was scheduled.
As expected, using more space per student was positively associated with activity levels. More space is usually available for physical education outdoors than indoors, and U.S. studies have found that outdoor lessons are typically more physically intense than indoor lessons (McKenzie et al., 2000). In the current study, however, lesson location was not associated with student physical activity levels. This difference may be due to the characteristics of the space available for physical education in the two countries. Compared with facilities in the United States, space in Hong Kong for both indoor and outdoor physical education is modest in terms of both size and amenities.
Large class size, found to be negatively associated with physical activity levels in some studies (McKenzie et al., 2000), was not significantly related to activity levels in the current investigation. The effect of class size on physical activity, which is likely confounded by numerous variables such as subject matter,

Physical Activity During Secondary School PE 35
availability of equipment, teacher training and experience, and student discipline, deserves further study. Additional Variables Teacher Gender. We analyzed the data by teacher gender to assess for potential differences that might result from gender value orientations (e.g., Penny, 2002). Although MVPA percent was higher in lessons taught by males (36.5 vs. 32.7%), the results were confounded by subject matter content and the gender of students in classes. Observations during large studies in the United States--including Child and Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health (McKenzie et al., 1995), Middle School Physical Activity and Nutrition (McKenzie et al., 2000), and Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (McKenzie et al., 2006)--found no differences in either physical activity or lesson context variables by teacher gender. The overall results suggest that modifiable variables such as subject matter content and lesson context are more important in determining physical activity during physical education than teacher gender. Teacher behavior. The finding that allocating increased lesson time for knowledge and class management negatively influenced MVPA is consistent with other studies (e.g., McKenzie et al., 1991). The finding that the amount of time that teachers spent in general instruction also negatively influenced activity levels, however, is inconsistent with the results of data collected in Hong Kong elementary schools (Chow et al., 2008). In that study, elementary school physical educators who spent more time in instruction had students with higher MVPA percent. Perhaps the difference in these findings is a result of student age and development. Younger children may need more detailed descriptions of skills and procedures and more frequent prompting from teachers. Adolescents, on the other hand, may be better equipped to work independently. Limitations and Recommendations While this study is one of the few to examine diverse environmental conditions on the physical activity levels in secondary school physical education, it is limited to observations in 238 lessons of grade 7­12 secondary schools in Hong Kong. Teachers were asked to teach according to their original plans, but it is possible that they selected different content or behaved differently because their classes were being observed. Teachers provided a wide array of content (33 sport or movement themes); thus, wide generalizations about the viability of different subject matter content to engage students in physical activity during lessons cannot be made.
Nonetheless, sedentary living is a worldwide problem (WHO, 2004). Engaging in physical activity during physical education is important for adolescents to learn movement skills and become physically fit, and it contributes to a variety of health factors. The study verified through direct, objective methods that numerous modifiable factors are related to adolescents' physical activity in secondary schools, including subject matter content, how teachers provide that content, and how they themselves behave during lessons. Future investigations should not only

36 Chow, McKenzie, and Louie
assess these variables in other physical education settings, but should also study the effects that in-class factors have on promoting adolescent physical activity beyond physical education and the school day.
