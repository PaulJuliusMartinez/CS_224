ABSTRACT: 1H NMR diffusion experiments performed on the signal of the metabolites in bovine optic nerve
showed that the signal decay due to diffusion is bi-exponential with a slow and a fast diffusing component. Diffusion
was measured as a function of the diffusion time, and the data were analyzed as a function of b and q values. Bi-
exponential ﬁt was used to analyze the data, and the results were compared with the displacement distribution proﬁles
obtained from the q-space analysis of the data. This q-space analysis showed that the fast diffusing component has a
broad displacement distribution and appears not to be restricted. On the other hand, the slow diffusing component
appears to be highly restricted to milieu in the order of 1–2 mm. The orientation of the sample with respect to the axis
for which diffusion was measured affected mainly the relative sizes of the populations of each component, but had
only a small effect on the extracted apparent diffusion coefﬁcients. These results from both the b and the q value
analyses suggest that the slow diffusing component is related to restricted diffusion of these metabolites in the axonal
ﬁbers, while the fast diffusing component represents diffusion of metabolites in cells and along the long axis of the
nerve ﬁbers. It is concluded that q-space analysis of metabolite diffusion enables extraction of structural information
about the sample, and that the diffusion of the metabolites in optic nerve is dictated mainly by the cellular medium and
microstructure of the tissue. Copyright (cid:211)

INTRODUCTION

Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) has become an important
tool for studying several brain pathologies.1–6 In addition,
it has been demonstrated that diffusion anisotropy
provides a mean for studying brain morphology.7–9 The
relative importance of diffusion as a contrast mechanism
and the complexity of signal attenuation in NMR
diffusion experiments in the central nervous system
(CNS) have prompted studies aimed at character-
izing water diffusion in biological tissues and in brain
tissue.10–13 It was assumed that, with better understand-
ing of the parameters that inﬂuence signal attenuation

in NMR diffusion experiments, this technique could be
applied to other pathologies. Such an understanding
might also elucidate known but not fully understood ob-
servations such as the origin of the low ADC in ischemic
tissue.1,3 13–18

Since signal attenuation in NMR diffusion experiments
depends on the root mean square (rms) displacement,11
NMR diffusion measurements may also provide structur-
al information about the investigated sample. Previously,
restricted diffusion was analyzed mainly by measuring
signal attenuation at ﬁxed gradient strength by varying
the pulsed gradient spacing19–20 and referring to the
diffusion weighting vector b.21–22 The decay of the signal
intensity as a function of the diffusion time was ﬁtted to a
speciﬁc model, and the translational displacement was
obtained with the help of Einstein’s equation. Another
way to extract
information using NMR
diffusion experiments is to perform a q-space analy-
sis,23–25 in which the displacement proﬁle (the prob-
ability of the molecular translational displacement) is
determined directly by Fourier transformation of the
attenuation of the signal (at ﬁxed pulse gradient spacing)
with respect to q—the spatial wave-number.25 The q

value determines the magnitude of the phase shift caused
by diffusion. In the pulsed gradient spin-echo experiment
(PGSE), q is related to the attenuation of the echo
intensity according to eq. (1):

where E (qq, D) is the echo decay as a function of qq, R is
the displacement, and Ps(cid:133)R; D(cid:134)is the average displace-
ment probability density. Therefore, one can use this
relation to measure the displacement distributions at ﬁxed
diffusion times.23–26 Such an analysis enables estimation
of the existence of restricted diffusion and measurement
of compartment size.23–27 Using appropriate experimen-
tal parameters (narrow and strong gradient pulses),
compartments having dimensions of microns could be
identiﬁed.23–28 Callaghan and co-workers showed how
this analysis explains the ‘diffusion–diffraction’ phe-
nomenon observed in NMR diffusion experiments of
porous materials.25,26 A ‘diffusion–diffraction’ effect
was recently reported for water diffusion in erythro-
cytes.29 q-Space analysis of NMR diffusion experiments
of brain water demonstrated changes in the population
fraction of water molecules which have a mean
displacement of (cid:6)10 mm before and after ischemia;30,31
however, no clear-cut delineation between the different
compartments was made in these experiments probably
because of water exchange.30,31

Several studies on water diffusion in isolated nerves
have been reported,32–37 aimed at characterizing the
origin of the diffusion anisotropy,32–35 and evaluating the
inﬂuence of degenerative processes on water diffusion in
the nerve.36–37 Recently Henkelman’s group proposed a
phenomenological model to explain water diffusion in
bovine optic nerve.33 This study showed that
the
dependence of the signal decay on the diffusion time of
nerve water is opposite to that of brain water, and similar
to that of brain metabolites.38–40

Contrary to the large number of studies devoted to
water diffusion in brain, only a few have dealt with the
in brain.41–47 Most were
diffusion of metabolites
performed with a single diffusion time,41–46 and all these
studies showed only a mono-exponential signal decay
due to diffusion.41–47 We recently demonstrated that, in
in situ brain, the attenuation due to diffusion of the N-
acetyl aspartate (NAA) signal is bi-exponential.38,39 In
the present study we investigated the diffusion character-
istics of metabolites (NAA, choline, and creatine) in
bovine optic nerve, and compared the results to our recent
ﬁndings on NAA diffusion in brain tissue.38–39 Isolated

components with real physiological compartments. In the
present study, signal attenuation was analyzed as a
function of b and q values at different diffusion times.
Metabolites are conﬁned to certain compartments and are
known to exchange at a slower rate than water molecules,
making them better probes for compartmentalization in
biological systems. We show here how q-space analysis
of metabolite diffusion data can be used to obtain
structural information about the size of the different
compartments in the sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tissue Preparation

Experiments were performed on freshly excised bovine
optic nerves (n = 7), which were immersed in deuterated
saline. Each nerve sample was dissected into two parts
and placed in two different 5 mm NMR tubes: one was
oriented parallel to the main axis of the pulsed gradient
(z-direction); the other was cut into several pieces and
placed in the tube perpendicular to the pulsed gradient
axis. The excised brain samples used for comparison
were prepared as described previously.38–39

NMR experiments

Diffusion experiments were performed on an 11.7 T
narrow-bore, ARX spectrometer
(Bruker, Karlsruhe,
Germany), using a commercial 5 mm inverse probe
equipped with a set of self-shielded, z-gradient coils
producing pulsed gradients of up to 50 gauss/cm.
Gradient pulses were generated by a B-AFPA 10 linear
ampliﬁer, and a BGU unit was used for pre-emphasis. All
experiments were performed at 25((cid:6) 1)(cid:176) C and completed
within 6 h of nerve excision. During this period no
signiﬁcant changes were observed in the extracted
parameters (ADC values and the sizes of their relative
populations).

Diffusion experiments (n = 3) were conducted using
the water suppressed stimulated echo diffusion sequence
(WS(cid:255)p /2(cid:255)t1(cid:255)g(cid:255)t2(cid:255)p /2(cid:255)TM(cid:255)p /2(cid:255)t2(cid:255)g(cid:255)t1(cid:255)Acq).
For water suppression we used a low-power long-
duration (100 ms) RF pulse on the water resonance. In
these experiments, t1 and t2 were set to 10 ms to avoid
residual eddy currents even at high gradient strength. The
duration of the pulsed gradient (g) was set to 15 ms,
resulting in a TE of 70 ms. The pulsed gradient strength
was incremented between 0 and 27 gauss/cm (in 14
steps). TM was incremented between 5 and 275 ms,
resulting in diffusion times between 35 and 305 ms,
respectively. The maximal b values in these experiments
were 4.1 (cid:2) 106 and 35.8 (cid:2) 106 s/cm2 for the diffusion
times of 35 and 305 ms, respectively. The maximal q
value of these experiments was 1727/cm.

incremented from 0 (ﬁrst row) to 27 g/cm (last row) in 14 equal steps. In these
experiments the diffusion time was 125 ms

In another set of experiments (n = 2), we investigated
the effect of TE on the NMR diffusion data. The diffusion
time was set to 125 ms (TM of 95 ms). The TE was
changed by increasing t1 from 10 to 250 ms, resulting in
TEs between 70 and 550 ms. We also conducted diffusion
experiments on two of the three nerves in the previous
group, in which TM was set to 95 ms and TE was set to
550 ms, making a total of four experiments performed at
a TE of 550 ms. The T2 of the metabolites was also
measured (n = 3) using the CPMG sequence with water
suppression. The diffusion experiments were repeated on
a sample of oil and tert-butanol to verify the accuracy of
the measurements, and to evaluate the stability of the
pulse gradients used in the study.

as peak height since on our 11.7 T spectrometer the
metabolite peaks showed no overlap and no signiﬁcant
changes were observed in the peak widths at all gradient
strengths. The experimental curves were ﬁtted using the

and the experimental data. X2 is deﬁned as:

Displacement distribution calculations

Displacement distribution calculations were obtained by
Fourier transform of the echo attenuation with respect to
the q values at ﬁxed diffusion time, according to eq (1).23
The 14 data points were zero-ﬁlled to 64 points to obtain
higher resolution of the distribution probability auto-
correlation function [Ps(cid:133)R; D(cid:134)].23 The Fourier transform
analysis was
tested on the experimental data of
stimulated echo diffusion experiments performed on t-
butanol and oil
samples, which gave, using the
mathematical procedure of Cory and Garroway,23 the
literature self-diffusion coefﬁcients (0.30 (cid:2) 10
(cid:255)5 and
0.042 (cid:2) 10
(cid:255)5 cm2/s for t-butanol and oil, respectively).

RESULTS

more or less the same for a given q-value. We have used
the choline peak for the analysis since it is the strongest
peak in the 1H NMR spectrum of nerve tissue. However,
similar behavior was observed for the NAA and creatine
peaks as well.

Table 1 depicts the results obtained by ﬁtting the
experimental data with the bi-exponential decay function
[eq. (2)]. This table shows the results for the different
metabolites in the two orientations at different diffusion
times. The decay of the signals was bi-exponential and
the extracted ADCs were dependent on the diffusion time
as found in brain tissue.38,39 The bi-exponential decay ﬁt
of both orientations revealed that changing the orienta-
tion of the nerve did not signiﬁcantly affect the extracted
ADCs of the metabolites. Surprisingly, the parameter
most affected by the orientation of the sample was found
to be the relative weighting of the populations: fast/slow
was (cid:24) 50:50% in the parallel orientation, and (cid:24)30:70%
in the perpendicular orientation.

These results, obtained from the bi-exponential ﬁt of
the experimental data, can be obtained from the Fourier
transform of the normalized signal attenuation as a
function of the q value with respect to q. This transform
gives the autocorrelation displacement probability den-
sity function of the compartment
in which the spin
diffuses. Figure 3 shows the displacement probability
functions obtained for choline in brain and in bovine
optic nerve in both orientations at a diffusion time of
125 ms. This graph shows that there are two compart-
ments, one with a narrow displacement proﬁle and one
with a broad displacement proﬁle. The latter is less
deﬁned because of the superimposed wiggles caused by
truncation of the data due to insufﬁcient signal loss. As
seen from the ﬁgure, the narrow displacement proﬁles
were very similar in brain and optic nerve in both
orientations. The main parameter that changed was the
relative size of the population with the narrow displace-
ment proﬁle. The largest population with a narrow
displacement proﬁle was found when the diffusion was
measured perpendicular to the principle axis of the optic
nerve.

Figure 4 shows the displacement probability functions
for the nerve in the parallel (A) and perpendicular (B)
directions, as well as the simulated probability density
functions obtained using the ADC parameters extracted
by ﬁtting the experimental data to eq. (2). The simulated
curves were extrapolated to a complete signal loss to
avoid the wiggles caused by truncation. These graphs
illustrate that truncation precluded precise determination
of the displacement probability proﬁle of the broad
component, while it had only a negligible broadening
effect on the narrow component. Thus, there was good
agreement between the experimental and simulated
displacement distribution proﬁles of the narrow compo-
nent.

The displacement probability functions for choline and
NAA peaks in optic nerve were found to be very similar

manifested in the difference between the diffusion
spectra obtained for
[Fig. 1(B)] and
perpendicular orientations [Fig. 1(C)] of the optic nerve.
We have found that the signal attenuation of NAA, as of
other metabolites in brain and nerve tissues, is clearly
non-mono-exponential. In addition, we have found that
the signal decay curve for the metabolite in brain tissue
lies in between the decay curves obtained for the
metabolite peaks in optic nerve in the two orientations
(see Discussion).

a function of the b- and q-values, respectively, at different

intensity was
higher for longer diffusion time for a given b-value,
indicating that ADCs are lower at longer diffusion times.
Interestingly, the normalized signal intensity remained

tion proﬁle (Table 2). This conclusion can also be
reached by analyzing the experimental data with respect
to the b values according to eq. (2), and calculating the
root mean square (rms) displacement of
the slow
component using the Einstein equation. From these
calculations it was found that the rms displacements for
the fast diffusing component of the choline peak were
almost unrestricted, while the slow-diffusing components
were conﬁned to a diffusing distance of about 1 mm
(Fig. 5).

CPMG experiments performed on the peaks of the
metabolites in bovine optic nerve revealed a multi-
exponential decay that suggests that the system is also
heterogeneous on the molecular scale. The curves in the
CPMG experiments were best ﬁtted to a tri-exponential
decay function giving three T2 values. One T2 was short
(T2 of (cid:24)35 ms) relative to the TE used in the diffusion
experiments, and had a relatively low fraction ((cid:24)10–
12%); it should therefore have a negligible effect on the
diffusion results. The other two T2 values were in the
order of (cid:24)200 and (cid:24)800 ms (Table 3). It should be noted
the same T2 values were measured for both

q-Space analysis of NMR diffusion experiments
provides displacement probabilities
from
which physical dimensions can be extracted.23–31 This
is important in systems where the signal decay as a
function of the b value is not mono-exponential, a fact
that may suggest the existence of several compartments
with different diffusion characteristics. Analyzing the
data as a function of q is even more important when this
compartmentalization is combined with effects of
restricted diffusion and exchange. Most q-space analysis
of diffusion experiments have been performed on porous
materials.24–27 Recently, q-space analysis was used to
probe structural changes that occur after an ischemic
event.31 Although King et al.31 found an increase in the
population that undergoes a net diffusive displacement of
less than 10 mm, the delineation and separation between
the different compartments was not obtained. This was
probably because of the heterogeneity of brain tissue and
since water molecules exchange quickly between the
different compartments there. These results prompt us to

change. The longer the TE the larger the population that
exhibited restricted diffusion [Fig. 6(B)]. The TE effect
was similar for choline, creatine and NAA.

DISCUSSION

The fact
that signal attenuation in NMR diffusion
experiments is related to the mean displacement of the
observed spins rather than to the intrinsic diffusion
coefﬁcient complicates the interpretation of the data, but
enables extraction of structural information. This struc-
tural information is biologically relevant, being in the
micron scale and obtained non-invasively. Structural
information can be better obtained by measuring and
analyzing the data when each parameter is changed
independently. Thus for extracting structural information

try such an analysis by measuring the diffusion of
metabolites, whose exchange across membranes is slow,
in efforts to obtain structural information. The conclusion
that exchange has only a negligible effect on metabolite
diffusion in the optic nerve was conﬁrmed when the
experimental data were compared with the theoretical
results predicted by Ka¨rger’s two-sites exchange mod-
el.48 Figure 7(A) and (B) depict the simulated signal
decay at mean half-life times (t) of 15 and 1000 ms,
respectively, as a function of the diffusion time. In all t’s
used the trend of the effect of the diffusion time was
opposite to the trend observed experimentally [Fig.
2(A)]. In addition, efforts to ﬁt the experimental data
obtained at a diffusion time of 125 ms with this model
showed that even at very long t (in the order of 1 s) there
is no overlap between the experimental and simulated
curves [Fig. 7(C)]. This comparison suggested that better
delineation between different compartments will be
achieved using diffusion measurements of metabolites
because of this relatively slow exchange between the
different compartments.

Fitting the experimental diffusion attenuation curves
of the metabolites (choline, NAA or creatine) in the optic
nerve to eq. (2) revealed two distinct diffusing compo-
nents, very similar to diffusing components previously
found for NAA in brain.39 In that study it was suggested
that the slow diffusing component was related mostly to
NAA in the axon ﬁbers, while the fast diffusing
component originated mostly from NAA in the cell
bodies. When we compared the data on diffusion of
metabolites in brain and nerve (Table 1), the ADCs were
found to be very similar for both tissues. In contrast, the
relative sizes of the populations of the different diffusing
components in brain seem to be an approximate weighted
average of the populations found for nerve in the parallel
and perpendicular orientations. Table 1 shows that the
ratio of fast/slow populations for choline (average on all
diffusion times) is 1.11((cid:6)0.11) in the parallel orientation
and only 0.46((cid:6)0.04) in the perpendicular orientation,
which points to an anisotropy effect. The fast/slow
population ratio for choline in the brain is 0.74((cid:6)0.25),
which is indeed an average of these values.38,39

This conclusion can also be reached from the q-space
analysis of the data of the brain and nerve tissues (Fig. 3)
in which the brain displacement curve lies between the

parallel and perpendicular curves of the optic nerve. The
fact that the slow diffusing population can be converted,
at least partially, to a fast diffusing component just by
changing the orientation of the sample suggests that the
slow diffusion component originates from restricted
diffusion, and not from a compartment whose intrinsic
diffusion of the metabolites is extremely slow. However,

found when the diffusion is measured parallel to the long

perpendicular to the long axis of the ﬁbers, may indicate
that not all axons run along the long axis of the ﬁbers.
These results can be reconciled by a certain percentage of
ﬁbers which have a long axis at a 90(cid:176)
tilt with respect to
the long axis of the nerve ﬁbers, and some bent axons and
in addition some more ‘spherical’ cells.

the data,

The comparison between the experimental and the
simulated displacement probability functions calculated
using the extracted values obtained from eq. (2) is
instructive (Fig. 4). Since the experimental displacement
probability function obtained from the q-space analysis
does not include any assumption and gives a spatial
presentation of
this comparison enables
evaluation of the physical meaning of the bi-exponential
ﬁt. This is so because the simulated displacement proﬁles
were constructed using the bi-exponential ﬁt parameters.
The populations found in the bi-exponential ﬁt suggest
that
the simulation is in good agreement with the
experimental results, and that the narrow displacement
probability function is related to the slow diffusing
component while the broad displacement one corre-
sponds to the fast diffusing component, as expected.
However, due to insufﬁcient gradient strength, trunca-
tions precluded clear delineation of the size of the
compartment having the wide displacement probability
function. A better delineation of
this
compartment should be obtainable with higher q values.
Additional evidence that the slow diffusing component
is related, at least partially, to metabolites that diffuse in
the restricted axonal milieu is provided by the diffusion
time dependency of the extracted parameters. The ADCs
of the slow diffusing component decrease considerably
when the diffusion time is increased from 35 to 305 ms
(see Table 1). By using the Einstein equation, one can

calculate for the slow diffusing component a diffusing
distance of about 1 mm at all diffusion times (Fig. 5). This
diffusion distance is in good agreement with the known
inner-axonal diameter of bovine optic nerve of around 1–
2 mm.33 Further evidence that
the slow diffusing
component originates, at least partially, from metabolites
within the axonal milieu comes from the comparison
between the displacement proﬁles obtained at different
diffusion times. The full width at half maximum height
(D X0.5) was found to be between 3.8 and 4.2 mm for all
diffusion times, showing that there was almost no change
in the width of the displacement proﬁles when the
diffusion time was increased from 35 to 305 ms (Table 2).
The D X0.5 parameter can also be related to the root mean
square displacement (rms) by the relation D Xrms = 0.425
D X0.5.24 This relation gives a diffusing distance of about
1.6–1.8 mm for the different experiments (Table 2)—
values that agree with the EM of bovine optic nerve (see
Fig. 2 in Stanisz et al.33) However, one should be careful
when using this relation and the Einstein equation for
extracting the rms displacement, since both assume free,
non-restricted diffusion, which is obviously not the case
here. Nevertheless, this analysis does provide approxi-

that

The effect of the TE on the signal decay depicted in
Fig. 6 shows a dramatic increase in the population
fraction of the slow diffusing component when the TE is
increased. This is clear both in the signal decay and in the
displacement probability curves, suggesting that the slow
diffusing component has a longer T2 than the fast
diffusing component. Another interesting and surprising
observation in the long TE experiments is the deviation
from a multi-exponential decay, and the small increase in

the normalized signal intensity at a q value of (cid:24)1000/cm.
This phenomenon was observed in all nerves (n=4) in
which we performed this experiment. This observation
can be understood in relation to the diffusion diffraction
phenomenon found for water in porous media25,26 and
erythrocytes.29,48 However,
there,25,26,29,49 the signal
decay was much larger than in the present study so the
effect was much more pronounced. To better characterize
this effect, one should use much shorter and stronger
gradient pulses than are currently available to us.

CONCLUSIONS

Diffusion of metabolites in nerve supports the hypothesis
that the two diffusing components observed in brain
tissue are related to metabolites in the axonal ﬁbers and in
the bodies of the cells. However, a fraction of the
population of the fast diffusing component seems to be
related to metabolites diffusing along the long axis of the
axon. Moreover, the population fraction of the fast and
slow diffusing components and their dependency on
sample orientation indicates that the model for metabolite
diffusion in optic nerve should include bent axons. In
addition, q-space analysis appears to be a powerful tool
for studying diffusion within samples of conﬁned
geometries. We demonstrated that simultaneous analysis
of NMR diffusion data as a function of q and b yields
structural
information. Better delineation of the two
compartments is obtained from NMR diffusion data of
metabolites than of water, since exchange seems to be
less important in the former. It seems that a diffraction-
like phenomenon occurs when metabolite diffusion in
optic nerve is measured with strong gradients. However,
more experiments with strong gradients are needed to
better characterize this observation.
