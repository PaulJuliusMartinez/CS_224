ABSTRACT A previously described mathematical model that simulates the metabolism of absorbed nutrients was used to examine factors influencing the efficiency of utilization of acetate in a sheep weighing 25 kg. A significant component of the model was a function representing substrate cycles that degraded ATP when its concentration reached twice initial levels. Acetate utilization was simulated when up to 2 g mol/d were added to four diets (representing forages and concentrates) that supplied varying proportions of absorbed volatile fatty acids, glucose and protein. The basal diets provided either 4.375 (near energy balance) or 8.75 MJ/d absorbed energy. The predicted net efficiency of utilization (k,) of the energy in added acetate was high (0.58‚"0.70) for all combinations of absorbed nutrients at the low level of energy absorption, whereas at the higher level, it ranged
from 0.16 (forage) to 0.49 (high protein concentrate). Low k, values were always associated with a considerable flux of ATP through the degradation pathway. The increase in ATP concentration that caused this pathway to operate was linked to an inhibition in the utilization of acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis and an increase in its oxidation. The simulated addition of exogenous NADPH or its precursors (particularly glucose and propionate) to these diets repartitioned acetyl-CoA flux towards
fatty acid synthesis instead of oxidation, decreased the flux of ATP through the degradation pathway and increased the k, of added acetate. Although a negative relationship was predicted between k, of added acetate and NADPH production for diets with increasing protein content, k, still depended on ATP flux through the degradation pathway. Addition of glucose to the high protein diets decreased this flux by decreasing acetyl-CoA oxidation and increasing fatty acid synthesis. The predictions suggest that
the efficiency of acetate utilization in ruminants may be influenced by NADPH availability when a considerable amount of absorbed energy is derived from acetate. Increased absorption of glucose or propionate enhanced NADPH production, but the major effect on acetate utilization of increasing dietary protein was not through NADPH production. J. Nutr. 117: 105‚"115, 1987.

In the metabolizable energy (ME) system proposed by the Agricultural Research Council (1, 2) to deter mine feed requirements of growing ruminants, esti mates are required for the efficiency of utilization of ME both below (Am) and above (Af) energy balance (maintenance).
The variation between diets in (k¬°c}an be severalfold (3, 4). Although positive correlations have been estab lished between ¬øfand the metabolizability (ME/gross energy) of a diet (3, 5), the relationships vary according to feed type and particularly with its crude fiber con tent. Blaxter (6) attempted to explain these effects on kt through the greater proportional production of ace

tate, relative to propionate and butyrate, in the rumen of sheep fed high fiber diets and the inefficient utili-

zation of acetate within the animal. Early experiments (7) showed that the energy from acetate infused into the rumen of sheep fed dried grass was used less effi ciently than the energy from either propionate or bu-
tyrate. However, subsequent experiments in which vol atile fatty acids (VFA) were given to sheep did not always confirm this observation (8-13). The conflicting results
may be explained by another experiment (14), which suggested that acetate utilization is influenced by the type of diet fed; it was used more efficiently when given to cattle consuming a hay-and-concentrate diet than
hay alone. Armstrong (15) suggested that an inadequate supply
of reduced NADP may limit the conversion of acetate to long-chain fatty acids in animals fed high-fiber diets. Although NADPH can be produced from acetyl-CoA
in ruminant adipose tissue (16), fatty acid synthesis from acetate can be stimulated by the addition of glu cose (17). Thus, MacRae and Lobley (18) argued that those diets in which acetate infusion resulted in a rel atively high efficiency of utilization had a ready supply of either glucose or glucose precursors (propionate and amino acids) to provide sufficient NADPH for the syn thesis of fatty acids from acetate. Conversely, they sug gested that when the supply of NADPH is inadequate, energy is lost as heat in some form of futile cycles and the overall efficiency of energy utilization is reduced.
The efficiency with which energy is utilized by an animal depends upon the quantities of individual nu trients absorbed in relation to the kinetics of competing biochemical reactions. There is now sufficient infor mation about the essential biochemical pathways in volved in nutrient metabolism and their kinetics to attempt to calculate the efficiency of energy utilization from an understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In this paper, a computer program that simulates these biochemical reactions (19) is used to evaluate factors that may influence the efficiency of acetate utilization in ruminants.
CALCULATION PROCEDURES
A full description of the computer simulation model, its biochemical pathways, their mathematical repre sentation and the parameter values used in the kinetic equations is given elsewhere (19). The inputs to the model are expressed as the molar fluxes of six nutrients (acetic acid, amino acid, butyric acid, glucose, lipid and propionic acid). Within the model, changes in the pool sizes of 12 state variables are considered, and metab olism is represented by 23 transactions. Two of these, the maintenance requirement and the maximum rate of protein synthesis, are described empirically (20, 21); the others are based on standard expressions from en zyme kinetics. The stoichiometric relationships as sumed between substrates and products, and derivation of affinity constants, inhibition constants, and maxi

mum reaction velocities are fully explained in a pre vious paper (19).
ATP is a key metabolite in the model, being produced in nine reactions and utilized in seven. During initial simulations it was found that in some situations ATP tended to accumulate due to its faster rate of production than utilization. Consequently, to achieve stability within the model and maintain ATP concentrations within physiological levels, an ATP degrading function (AtDg, equation 21k, r√©f1.9) was introduced to remove ATP by means of a sigmoidal relationship with a "switch on" when ATP concentration reached twice the initial
value. This reaction represents futile or substrate cycles (22) that dissipate ATP as heat.
Energy retention in the body was calculated as the sum of the net deposition of energy in body protein, wool, scurf, adipose tissue and glycogen stores. Metab-
olizable energy was derived from absorbed energy by adding an estimated heat of fermentation and subtract ing predicted urine energy. The marginal efficiency of ME utilization (kf] was calculated from the results of simulations conducted on the same diet at two levels of feeding and was assumed to be the increment in energy retention as a fraction of the increment in ME intake. The model has been programmed in the con tinuous simulation languages CSMP (23) and ACSL (24); program listings can be obtained from the authors.
The simulations were conducted for a 25-kg Merino
male sheep, and were designed principally to investi gate the effects of varying the relative proportions of absorbed nutrients on the flux of these through various biochemical pathways, on energy retention and on the efficiency of utilization of ME. Considerable effort was made to use nutrient absorptions typical of the specific dietary situations simulated. However, in fixing these values, no complete experimental data sets were avail able that related all nutrients absorbed to energy uti lization. Consequently, the input values, as given in Table 1, were derived from consideration of the many studies which have been reported on nutrient digestion and absorption in sheep. These included measurements on the extent of organic matter digestion in the rumen (2), the molar yield of total VFA in the rumen (25) and in the cecum (26) per unit of energy digested therein, the effect of diet on VFA molar proportions in the ru men (27), and the disappearance of total amino acids (28), long-chain fatty acids (29) and glucose (30) from
the small intestine.

When basal energy absorption was low and near that required for zero energy retention (see Fig. 1), the re sponse to additional acetate was predicted to be linear and little affected by the proportions of absorbed nu trients. For diets 1, 2 and 3, the efficiency of utilization of additional ME from 2 g mol acetate/d was 0.70, whereas it was 0.58 for diet 4. With diets 1, 2 and 3, fat deposition increased in response to added acetate, whereas body protein deposition remained unchanged. With the high protein diet 4, both fat and protein de position increased.
By contrast, when basal energy absorption was high (Fig. 2b), the response to additional acetate was cur vilinear and more variable between diets. Overall ef ficiency depended greatly on the balance of nutrients absorbed, with values for k{ of 0.16, 0.23, 0.47 and 0.49 for 2 g mol acetate/d added to diets 1, 2, 3 and 4, re spectively, and 0.22, 0.31, 0.61 and 0.55 for l g mol/d. Protein deposition was predicted to be unaffected by increased acetate absorption with diets 1, 2 and 3 be cause protein absorption was limiting, whereas there was an increase in fat deposition (Fig. 3), especially with diet 3 (high glucose). Diet 4 (unsupplemented) allowed less fat synthesis than the other diets due to greater energy deposition in protein and smaller acetate supply, but the provision of additional acetate stimulated both protein and fat deposition.
Effect of additional acetate on the partition of nu trients. The effect of adding acetate to the four basal diets on the disposal of acetyl-CoA between oxidation
and fatty acid synthesis is shown in Fig. 4. The per centage of acetate absorbed from the basal diets that was oxidized was 49%, 46%, 30% and 40% for diets 1 to 4, respectively, when absorbed energy was 4.375 MJ/ d and 63%, 59%, 52% and 55%, respectively, when

energy absorption was doubled. Consistently less ace tate was oxidized with the high glucose diet (diet 3). An average of 65% of added acetate was oxidized when the basal level of absorbed energy was 4.375 MJ/d com-

energy absorption was doubled. Consistently less ace tate was oxidized with the high glucose diet (diet 3). An average of 65% of added acetate was oxidized when the basal level of absorbed energy was 4.375 MJ/d com pared with 79% at the higher level. The flux of acetate to fatty acid was highest with diet 3 (high glucose) and lowest for diets 1 (low glucose) and 4 (high protein). The flux of glucose to NADPH broadly followed the dietary-induced differences in fatty acid synthesis from
acetate (Fig. 4).
Sensitivity of acetate utilization to NADPH availability
To evaluate the hypothesis that acetate is used with low efficiency when given to ruminants eating forage diets because of an inadequate supply of NADPH, the sensitivity of predicted energy retention to exogenous NADPH was tested. From 1 to 4 g mol NADPH/d were added during simulations of diet 1 (supplying 8.75 MJ/ d absorbed energy) with increments of 1, 1.5 or 2 g mol acetate/d. Predicted energy retention increased with the supply of NADPH at each addition of acetate (Fig. 5). The efficiency of retention of ME derived from 2 g mol acetate/d increased from 0.16 with no added NADPH to 0.64 when 4 g mol NADPH/d was provided. The effect on energy retention became smaller with suc

cessive increments of NADPH, primarily because the endogenous production of NADPH from acetyl-CoA
and glucose was inhibited by the increased concentra tion of NADPH resulting from its exogenous addition, as predicted from equations I5b and 33c of the com puter program (19).
The increased availability of NADPH substantially altered the flux of acetyl-CoA through alternative bio chemical pathways. Both the oxidation of acetyl-CoA
and its conversion to NADPH were substantially re duced as NADPH production increased, whereas its utilization for fatty acid synthesis increased (Fig. 66). These changes in acetyl-CoA flux resulted in a sub
stantial increase in body fat deposition and hence body weight gain (Fig. 6a). Associated with these changes in acetyl-CoA utilization was a marked reorganization of
ATP fluxes; less was produced and more utilized in fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 7). Thus, an increase in NADPH supply resulted in a decrease in the concentration of ATP in the animal and this caused a substantial re duction in its flux through the degradation pathway (Fig. 7). The major effect of NADPH on ATP transac tions was through a reduction in ATP formation, par ticularly from the oxidation of acetyl-CoA, rather than
an increase in its utilization for fatty acid synthesis.

0.47, 0.55 and 0.56. The predicted patterns of body pro tein and fat deposition with increases in acetate ab sorption are given in Figs. 9b and 9c.
Overall NADPH production from the diets was pre dicted to decline as the proportion of protein in ab sorbed nutrients increased. For example, with diets pro viding 1% glucose and no added acetate, NADPH production declined from 3.266 to 2.957 g mol/d as the protein content of absorbed energy was raised from 10% to 20%. Corresponding values for diets providing 5% glucose were 3.689 and 3.465 g mol/d. The decline in NADPH production resulted mainly from a reduction in glucose formation from propionate because the total amount of VFA absorbed declined as the protein pro-

Although the efficiency of utilization of the energy from acetate added to diet 1 was predicted to be strongly related to NADPH production, there was no such re lationship among the four diets (Fig. 8). The highest efficiency of acetate utilization was predicted to occur when it was added to diet 4, which contained 25% of energy as protein and which had the lowest NADPH production rate of all diets simulated.
Effect of protein and glucose absorption on the
utilization of additional acetate
In this series of simulations, the effects of increasing the protein content of diet 1 and of adding extra glucose on acetate utilization were investigated. From 10% to 20% of absorbed energy was derived from protein, either 1% or 5% from glucose, 4% from lipid and the re mainder from VFA in proportions 73:20:7 (ace-
tate:propionate:butyrate). Increments of 1 or 2 g mol acetate/d were added to the basal diets, which provided 8.75 MJ/d absorbed energy.
Retention of the additional energy from acetate (Fig. 9a) became more efficient as either protein or glucose absorption increased. Predicted values for lcf of addi tional acetate (2 g mol/d) over the range of absorbed energy from 8.75 to 10.5 M}/d were 0.16, 0.26, 0.36 and 0.43 for diets containing 10%, 12.5%, 15% and 20% protein and 1% glucose. Corresponding values for diets containing 5% absorbed energy as glucose were 0.35,

Thus, contrary to the situation described in Fig. 8, there was a negative relationship between k{ of additional acetate and the mean production rate of NADPH (Fig. 10).
The increase in kf of added acetate with increasing protein absorption was again predicted to be associated with changes in ATP utilization. For the 25-kg animal simulated, body protein deposition was predicted to be limited by protein supply with all diets when 2 g mol

The increase in protein absorption was achieved by decreas ing VFA absorption, and these two factors had a con siderable effect on ATP flux (Fig. 11). Production, par ticularly from acetyl-CoA oxidation, declined, and
utilization for protein synthesis and urea formation in creased. The concentration of ATP therefore fell, and its removal through the degradation pathway declined; the result being a substantial increase in kt of added acetate.

tween fatty acid synthesis and oxidation resulted from an increase in NADPH production.
Gluconeogenesis from propionate
NADPH is derived within the model primarily from glucose, and propionate is the major glucose precursor. Hence, reactions requiring NADPH are sensitive to the affinity constant used for the propionate-to-glucose re
action (iCP1Gru√, ©1f.9), which affects the partitioning of propionate between gluconeogenesis and oxidation. In the foregoing simulations, KpiGuwas set by assuming that, under the initial conditions used to calculate pa rameters, 30% of total propionate flux goes to glucose (31), and the concentration of propionate in liver was 0.187 g mol/L (32).

This change in KP1Guhad
a substantial effect on predicted energy retention, with the efficiency of utilization of energy from additional

DISCUSSION
Direct comparisons between predictions from the computer program and experimental results cannot be made because, to our knowledge, there are no published data relating the absorption of all nutrients to either metabolism of individual nutrients or energy utiliza tion in sheep. Nevertheless, the simulations generally agree with the values reported in the literature for the efficiency of acetate utilization and the effect of the basal diet on this efficiency. Calorimetry studies sug gest that the efficiency of acetate utilization is low (0.33 and 0.27) when it is given as a supplement to a roughage diet (7, 14), whereas higher values (0.54 and 0.69) have been recorded (12, 14) when a concentrate diet was supplemented with acetate. The simulations also sug gest that the efficiency of acetate utilization depends upon the level of feeding and that high efficiencies can result with all diets when acetate is given to animals fed near maintenance levels when the rate of fat depo sition is low. We know of no experiments with which to compare these latter predictions.
In the simulations conducted, low values for kf were always associated with considerable flux of ATP through the degradation pathway. The buildup in ATP concen tration that caused this pathway to operate was linked mainly to an inhibition in the utilization of acetyl-CoA
for fatty acid synthesis and an increase in its oxidation. The simulated addition of exogenous NADPH in creased kf and decreased the flux of ATP through the degradation pathway. NADPH is required for the syn thesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA, and an increase in its production enhanced the flux of acetyl-CoA to
fatty acids and decreased its oxidation and conversion to NADPH. The marked reduction in ATP concentra tion resulting from the increase in NADPH production was caused primarily by a reduction in ATP synthesis because, for each mole of acetyl-CoA utilized, 12 mol
ATP are produced during oxidation, 9 mol during con version to NADPH and only 1.1481 mol is used for the synthesis of fatty acid.
Thus, the predicted importance of NADPH on the flux of acetyl-CoA through alternative pathways when
acetate supplies a high proportion of the absorbed en ergy lends some support to the hypothesis that the ef ficiency of acetate utilization in ruminants depends upon the availability of glucogenic precursors (12, 18). However, this does not appear to be the complete ex planation. A negative relationship was predicted be tween kf of added acetate and NADPH production for diets increasing in protein content (Fig. 10). The flux of ATP through the degradation pathway declined as the protein contribution to absorbed energy increased, and it appears that the kf of added acetate is determined

primarily by the relative rates of production and uti lization of ATP. An increase in protein absorption in creased ATP utilization for body protein synthesis and urea formation, whereas the associated decline in VFA absorption led to a decreased ATP production, partic ularly from acetyl-CoA oxidation. This latter effect,
rather than a glucogenic response, was the main reason for the improved kf with increasing proportions of di etary protein.
Thus, while the model agrees with the hypothesis (18) that glucose and propionate can improve the effi ciency of utilization of high levels of acetate by pro viding the NADPH required to repartition acetyl-CoA
flux from oxidation to fatty acid synthesis, it suggests that the effect of protein in improving acetate utiliza tion is not directly related to NADPH production. This latter idea is contrary to the interpretation of a recent experiment in which casein infusion into the abomasum of sheep fed an autumn-harvested grass improved
the efficiency of ME utilization (33). The authors sug gested that the improvement in efficiency was due to an increase in NADPH production as a result of glu-
coneogenesis from amino acids. However, the current predictions indicate that a similar improvement could be obtained if casein absorption stimulated the syn thesis of body protein and reduced the synthesis of body fat. Unfortunately, the authors did not report the effects of casein infusion on fat and protein deposition, but in other experiments (33) in which spring-harvested and autumn-harvested grasses were compared, differences
in the efficiency of ME utilization were associated with differences in amino acid absorption and in nitrogen retention in the body. Further evidence that protein absorption can influence the efficiency of ME utiliza tion by changing the rates of fat and protein depositions are given in a subsequent paper (34).
The preceding interpretation of how dietary factors affect the utilization of acetate depends heavily on the assumption that excess ATP is dissipated through the degradation pathway. Many substrate cycles that hy-
drolyze ATP have been shown to exist in animal tissues (35-37). Several of these, including the fructose-6phosphate ^ fructose diphosphate; glucose ^ glucose6-phosphate; triacylglyceride ^ fatty acid; hexose monophosphate ¬±^glycogen and nicotinamide nu-
cleotides cycles have been studied closely (22). The fructose-6-phosphate ^ fructose diphosphate cycle
has been shown to be important in maintaining the temperature of flight muscles of resting bumblebees (38). Newsholme and Crabtree (22) argue that the flux through substrate cycles is influenced by the concen tration of substrates and they suggest that the increase in heat production observed in animals after a meal may result from increased activity of cycling between substrates such as amino acids and protein, glucose and glucose-6-phosphate as well as triacylglycerides and fatty acids. In ruminants, the acetate ^ acetyl-CoA cycle
may be an important source of heat, particularly when

acetyl-CoA conversion to fatty acids is inhibited by an
inadequate supply of NADPH. It is significant that the lowest level of endogenous acetate production was found in dairy cattle consuming high concentrate diets (39), although the interpretation of these results has been questioned (40). Calculations by Newsholme and Crab-
tree (22) suggest that energy dissipation through sub strate cycles could be sufficient to account for differ ences in kf observed between ruminants absorbing different nutrient mixtures, but a study of these cycles in ruminants is required to demonstrate their magni tude. In the model, 77.3 MJ heat was assumed to be produced from the hydrolysis of each kilogram mole ATP via the degradation pathway (19).
The model predictions are sensitive to the values given to several parameters. For example, the affinity constant for the synthesis of glucose from propionate (KpicJ was calculated by assuming that 30% of total propionate flux was converted to glucose under the standard conditions used for setting parameters (19). Observed values for the proportion of rumen propionate production converted to glucose in sheep offered 800 g/d of lucerne chaff range from 25-38% (41). Other
values as high as 50% have been obtained using mea surements of propionate entry into the ruminai vein (42). Within the model, VFA inputs are based on molar proportions measured in the rumen and do not allow for metabolism of propionate within the rumen wall during absorption (43). It therefore seemed appropriate to set KpiGuby using a value for the proportion of pro pionate converted to glucose that had been obtained from experiments in which rumen propionate produc tion was measured.
A test of the sensitivity of the model to /CPIGuin calculation of kt showed that the value chosen for this parameter had a substantial impact (Fig. 12). Although predicted kf agreed more closely with the observed val ues (14) when KPlCuwas based on 30% rather than 50%, it highlighted the need for better understanding of the factors governing the contribution of propionate to glu cose synthesis. It is hoped, therefore, that the devel opment of this metabolic model will stimulate research into better defining the flux of absorbed nutrients through alternative biochemical pathways and in relating these observations to changes in energy metabolism and fat and protein deposition in animals.
