Executive Summary Precision farming uses a set of technologies to map yield variability within a farm field and diagnose its causes, prescribe variable rates of inputs across the field according to soil and crop needs, and apply those inputs at variable rates according to the prescription. Cotton farmers lack adequate information to make optimal decisions about the adoption of precision farming technologies. The objectives of this study were 1) to determine attitudes toward and current use of precision farming technologies by cotton producers in the six-state region of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee and 2) to examine the willingness of cotton producers in the six-state region to pay for a cotton yield monitoring system. A mail survey of cotton producers in the six-state region was conducted in January and February of 2001. This report presents the aggregate results for the six-state region. Twentythree percent of respondents had used at least one precision farming technology. The most common technologies used in cotton production were grid and management zone soil sampling, variable rate lime application, plant tissue testing, soil survey maps, and variable rate phosphorous and potassium application. Profit and environmental benefits were the most influential factors in a producer's decision to adopt precision farming technologies, while Extension/University personnel, crop consultants, and farm dealers were the most helpful in learning about these technologies. Eighty-five percent of adopters and 63% of non-adopters thought precision farming would be profitable for them to use in the future. Eighty-six percent of adopters and 74% of non-adopters owned computers, while 74% and 55% used them for farm management, respectively. A farmer's willingness to purchase a cotton yield monitoring system was inversely related to the price of the system.

Precision Farming by Cotton Producers in Six Southern States: Results from the 2001 Southern Precision Farming Survey
Roland K. Roberts, Burton C. English, James A. Larson, Rebecca L. Cochran, Bob Goodman, Sherry Larkin, Michele Marra, Steve Martin, Jeanne Reeves, and Don Shurley
Introduction Production of cotton requires a multitude of inputs and cropping activities that include preparing seed beds, planting, reducing competition from insects and weeds, applying harvest aids, and harvesting cotton. Indeed, the cost of producing cotton is considerably higher than the costs of producing corn, soybeans, or wheat (Gerloff, 2001a and 2001b). Reducing input levels through more efficient input use has been a goal of cotton producers and researchers alike. Precision farming may increase cotton production efficiency, reduce input use, and increase yields and profits. Precision farming uses a set of technologies to identify and measure within-field variability and its causes, prescribe site-specific input applications that match varying crop and soil needs, and apply the inputs as prescribed. Thus far, most producers have made only modest investments in precision farming technologies (Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1999). A review of literature by Lambert and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000) summarized the profitability of precision farming. Seventy-three percent of the studies they reviewed found precision farming to be profitable. An important determinant of precision farming profitability is crop value. Extensive research has been conducted in low-value grain crops for which yield monitors have been commercialized. The use of precision technology for cotton (a highervalued crop) is more limited because accurate yield monitors have only recently become commercially available. Because cotton is an important high-value crop in the Southeast, an

assessment of the use of precision farming practices, an investigation into the factors that influence adoption of precision farming technologies, and an evaluation of the likelihood that cotton producers will adopt newly developed yield monitoring systems would provide important information for cotton producers and agribusinesses alike.
The future of precision farming in cotton production depends on how producers view this set of technologies and how willing they are to improve current management practices. Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer (1998) caution that the early profits of technology adoption will go to those producers with strong technical and managerial skills. A need exists to assess producers' experiences with a variety of precision farming technologies and to determine what benefits they have received or expect to receive from using these technologies. Such an assessment is needed to appraise the present status and future prospects for adoption of precision farming technologies by cotton producers in the Southeast.
Objectives The objectives of this study were 1) to determine attitudes toward and current use of precision farming technologies by cotton producers in the six-state region of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee and 2) to examine the willingness of cotton producers in the six-state region to pay for a cotton yield monitoring system.
Methods Survey Methods
A mail survey of cotton producers located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee was conducted in January and February of 2001 to establish the current use of precision farming technologies. This report provides results aggregated over the six-state region.

A questionnaire was developed to query producers about their attitudes toward and use of precision farming technologies (Appendix I). The questionnaire was pre-tested on two producers in Tennessee, and their suggestions were incorporated into the final version. Following Dillman's (1978) general mail survey procedures, the questionnaire, a postage-paid return envelope, and a cover letter explaining the purpose of the survey were sent to each producer. The initial mailing of the questionnaire was on January 16, 2001, and a reminder post card was sent one week later on January 23, 2001. A follow-up mailing to producers not responding to previous inquiries was conducted three weeks later on February 15, 2001. The second mailing included a letter indicating the importance of the survey, the questionnaire, and a postage-paid return envelope. Recipients were instructed to return a blank questionnaire if they were not a cotton producer.
The list of potential cotton producers, which included a total of 8,411 individuals for the 1999-2000 season, was furnished by the Cotton Board in Memphis, Tennessee (Skorupa, 2000). Of the potential cotton producers, 1,158 were from Alabama, 212 from Florida, 2,990 from Georgia, 1,334 from Mississippi, 1,798 from North Carolina, and 919 from Tennessee. The total number of surveys mailed was reduced to 6,423 by randomly selecting 1,400 potential producers from the Georgia list and 1,400 from the North Carolina list. This reduction lowered the cost of the survey but did not perceptibly reduce the ability to draw inferences about cotton producers in Georgia, North Carolina, or the six-state region.
In estimating means, standard deviations, and percentages for the six-state region, adjustments were made for Georgia and North Carolina to give them proper weight in the sample. For example, because only 1,400 of the 2,990 potential Georgia cotton producers were surveyed, the number of responses was adjusted upward by a factor of 2.14 (or 2,990/1,400) to
3

give Georgia proper weight in the sample. The adjustment factor for North Carolina was 1.28 (or 1,798/1,400). These adjustments assume that potential cotton producers who were not surveyed would have responded similarly to those who were randomly surveyed from the address lists. The tables in Appendix II report the adjusted number of responses for the six-state region. Means, standard deviations, and percentages reported in those tables are weighted by the adjusted number of responses for each state.
Of the 6,423 questionnaires mailed, 196 were returned undeliverable, and 251 indicated that they were not cotton farmers or they had retired, giving a total of 5,976 cotton producers who received the questionnaire in the six-state region. Making the aforementioned adjustments for Georgia and North Carolina gave an estimated population of cotton producers of 7,885 and estimated responses totaling 1,373, which gave a six-state aggregate response rate of 17% (Appendix II, Table 1). Definition of Precision Farming
The following statement was given to farmers at the top of the questionnaire (Appendix I): "Precision farming involves collecting information about within-field variability in yields and crop needs to assist in determining appropriate input levels and applying that information to your farm fields. This may result in varying input levels within each field." This broad definition of precision farming encompasses technologies that may or may not use Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). For example, three categories of yield monitoring were listed; yield monitoring with GPS, yield monitoring without GPS, and yield monitoring without a yield monitor. A farmer using the latter technology was considered to measure within-field yield variability by some method other than yield sensors.

Questions for Adopters (Questions 1-19) Precision farming technology adopters indicated the number of years they used various
precision farming technologies on cotton and other crops (Appendix I). They reported the farmmanagement value of the technologies they used and the factors that prompted their decisions to practice precision farming. They provided information about soil sampling techniques, use of variable rate input application technologies, and how variable rate application affected total input use and cotton yields. Adopters listed owned or leased precision farming equipment and problems encountered with the equipment. They rated the importance of several information sources in learning about the precision farming technologies they had used or investigated. Offfarm precision farming services used on their farms were identified along with the cost of hiring those services. Adopters indicated whether or not they thought precision farming technologies were profitable on their fields and listed the technologies they planned to discontinue. They also indicated whether or not they had experienced improvements in environmental quality through the use of precision farming, and they identified the improvements observed. Questions for Adopters and Non-Adopters (Questions 20-41)
Precision farming adopters and non-adopters were questioned about the future of precision farming: Specifically, if they prefer to own or lease equipment; to provide a best estimate of the typical purchase price of a cotton yield monitoring system with GPS (Global Positioning System); and to provide demographic and farm business information. To obtain information about cotton producers' willingness to pay for a yield monitoring system (Objective 2), the mailing list from the Cotton Board was randomly divided into six equal groups with each group given a different purchase price in the willingness to pay questions. First, respondents were asked if they owned a cotton picker and the size of the picker. Second, they were asked if
5

they would be willing to purchase a cotton yield monitoring system for their existing cotton picker for the stated price. Third, respondents indicated if they were considering purchasing or leasing a new cotton picker and the size of the picker. Respondents then indicated their willingness to purchase or lease an optional cotton yield monitoring system for the stated price when purchasing or leasing a new cotton picker. The purchase prices for the six groups were $4,500, $6,000, $7,500, $9,000, $10,500, and $12,000. The list price at the time of the survey was $9,500 for a cotton yield monitoring system that included a monitor, a GPS receiver, sensors on two chutes of a 4-5-row picker, and the ability to estimate lint yield within 4% of actual yields. The price of an additional sensor for a six-row picker was $1,285 (Ag Leader Technology, 2001).
Results Results are presented in four sections. The first section compares results from the survey with the 1997 Census of Agriculture (US Department of Agriculture, 1999). The second section presents information about the use of precision farming technologies by cotton farmers who have adopted these technologies in the six-state region. In the third section, perceptions about the future of precision farming are presented for all respondents (adopters and non-adopters), along with their willingness to pay for a cotton yield monitoring system. Demographic and farm characteristics are compared for precision farming adopters and non-adopters in the fourth section. Comparison of Six-State Survey Data with Census Data The distribution of cotton farmers across the six states in the survey (Appendix II, Table 1) corresponded closely with the 1997 distribution of cotton farmers (US Department of Agriculture, 1999). The distribution of responses across the states was somewhat different from
6

the distribution of cotton farmers found in the Census and the survey because response rates

were different across the states. For example, 22% of total responses were from Georgia

(percentage not reported in Appendix II, Table 1) compared with 37% of cotton farmers. The

low response rate of 10% for Georgia led to this difference.

Figure 1 shows the age distributions for cotton producers as reported in the 1997 Census

compared with the age distribution of farmers who responded to the survey. The majority of respondents (59%) ranged in age from 35 to 54 years, compared with slightly less than a majority (48%) in this category reported in the Census. Respondents who were 34 years of age or less were a smaller percentage of total producers (7%) than were represented in

The largest difference between survey and Census data was for the 45-to-54-age group for which

the percentages of farmers in this category were 33% and 25% for the survey and the Census,

respectively. Results indicate that survey respondents were concentrated more in the middle age

categories than was found in the 1997 Census.

Adopter Responses about Precision Farming

Precision Farming Technology Use

A response to question 1 indicated that a cotton farmer was an adopter of at least one

precision farming technology listed. Responses reported in Table 1 indicate that the numbers of

precision farming technology adopters by state were 46 of 238 respondents for Alabama (19% of

respondents), 7 of 50 respondents for Florida (14%), 75 of 301 respondents for Georgia (25%),

65 of 262 respondents for Mississippi (25%), 94 of 370 respondents for North Carolina (25%),

and 29 of 152 respondents for Tennessee (19%). For the six-state region, 23% of respondents

were precision farming adopters. Almost all responding adopters had used some form of

precision farming technology to produce cotton (293 of 316 adopters), while 163 had used it to

produce corn, 124 for peanuts, 39 for rice, 138 for soybeans, 57 for tobacco, and 103 for wheat

(not reported in a table).

Adopting producers were asked to indicate the precision farming technologies they had used and the number of years they had used them to produce cotton and other crops (survey question 1). The technologies used for cotton production by the most farmers were grid soil sampling by 158 farmers for an average of 4.2 years, management zone soil sampling by 121 farmers for 10.3 years, variable rate lime application by 116 farmers for 4.8 years, plant tissue testing by 115 farmers for 6.2 years, soil survey maps by 103 farmers for 11.2 years, and variable rate phosphorous and potassium application by 102 farmers for 5.6 years (Appendix II, Table 2). Twenty-eight adopting respondents practiced yield monitoring with GPS for an average of 1.7 years.
Technologies used by the largest numbers of adopters to produce corn were grid soil sampling by 68 farmers for an average of 6.0 years, management zone soil sampling by 68 farmers for 10.7 years, variable rate lime application by 56 farmers for 7.6 years, variable rate phosphorous and potassium application by 55 farmers for 8.1 years, and soil survey maps by 52 farmers for 16.2 years (Appendix II, Table 3). Yield monitoring with GPS and yield monitoring without GPS had 36 and 35 responding farmers using these technologies for 3.0 and 2.8 years, respectively.
The technologies most used for peanut production were grid soil sampling by 52 farmers for an average of 7.5 years, variable rate lime application by 41 farmers for 7.3 years, management zone soil sampling by 40 farmers for 10.7 years, soil survey maps by 39 farmers for 13.0 years, yield monitoring without GPS by 33 farmers for 3.4 years, and variable rate phosphorous and potassium application by 33 farmers for 6.2 years (Appendix II, Table 4). Six adopting respondents practiced yield monitoring with GPS for an average of 1.5 years.
9

Technologies used by the largest numbers of adopters to produce rice were yield monitoring without GPS by 30 farmers for an average of 2.8 years, management zone soil sampling by 4 farmers for 11.5 years, soil survey maps by 4 farmers for 23.2 years, and yield monitoring with GPS by 3 farmers for 2.3 years (Appendix II, Table 5).
The most used precision farming technologies for soybean production were soil survey maps by 57 farmers for an average of 17.9 years, management zone soil sampling by 49 farmers for 14.7 years, grid soil sampling by 46 farmers for 8.4 years, yield monitoring without a yield monitor by 44 farmers for 17.4 years, and variable rate lime application by 32 farmers for 15.5 years (Appendix II, Table 6). Yield monitoring with GPS was used by 25 adopters on soybeans for an average of 2.8 years, while yield monitoring without GPS was used by 22 adopters for an average of 1.8 years.
Yield monitoring without GPS was used by 20 adopting farmers to produce tobacco for an average of 1.8 years, while soil survey maps were used an average of 20.3 years by 16 farmers. Grid soil sampling, variable rate lime application, and management zone soil sampling were used on tobacco by 14, 14, and 13 adopters for averages of 13.3, 16.2, and 15.7 years, respectively (Appendix II, Table 7). Currently, a yield monitor for tobacco does not exist. Those respondents reporting yield monitoring without GPS probably were in the yield monitoring without a yield monitor category.
Technologies used by the largest numbers of adopters to produce wheat were management zone soil sampling by 39 farmers for 13.4 years, soil survey maps by 38 farmers for 18.3 years, grid soil sampling by 32 farmers for 7.1 years, yield monitoring without a yield monitor by 31 farmers for 17.3 years, and variable rate lime application by 26 farmers for 8.6
10

years. Yield monitoring with GPS was used by 23 adopters for an average of 2.7 years and yield monitoring without GPS was used by 22 adopters for 1.6 years (Appendix II, Table 8).
With the exception of corn, a larger number of adopting cotton producers used yield monitoring with GPS on cotton than on other crops. The average number of years this technology had been used by adopters on cotton (1.7 years) was lower than for corn (3.0 years), soybeans (2.8 years), and wheat (2.7 years). This finding was not unexpected because accurate yield monitoring technology has only recently become commercially available for cotton production. Grid and management zone soil sampling and soil survey maps were important technologies for adopters on most crops. Decision-Making Value of Technologies
Adopters were asked to rate the decision-making value of precision farming on a scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (very important) as presented in Table 9 of Appendix II (survey question 2). Average scores given by adopting respondents were highest for "Improving yields" (4.6), "Maintaining better soil test, financial, and yield records," which received average scores of 4.2, 4.1, and 4.1, respectively, and for "Discovering a need for drainage" (3.9). "Quit farming a portion of a field or an entire field" (2.9) and "Discovering a need for leveling" (3.1) were least important to adopters. Nevertheless, with the exception of "Quit farming a portion of a field or an entire field," cotton producers who had adopted precision farming technologies considered these technologies at least moderately important by scoring their value in making management decisions an average of 3.00 or higher. Factors Influencing Use of Precision Farming Technologies
Precision farming adopters were asked to rate on a scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (very important) several factors that went into their decision to adopt precision farming technologies
11

(survey question 3). Adopters reported that profit was the most important factor prompting their adoption of precision farming (4.5 average score), with 67% of respondents considering it very important and only 2% indicating it was not important to their decision (Appendix II, Table 10). The fear of being left behind, which had an average score of only 2.4, was least likely to persuade producers to practice precision farming. Environmental benefits received the second highest average score of 3.8, which was considerably lower than the average score received for profit, but still more than moderately important. Soil Sampling Technologies
Questions 4 through 8 of the survey questioned adopting producers about their soil sampling practices. Forty-five percent of responding adopters did the majority of their soil sampling within management zones, 26% did grid soil sampling, while only 10% pulled cores from grids within management zones (Appendix II, Table 11). Eighteen percent of adopters used none of the precision sampling choices listed in question 4.
Forty-four percent of responding adopters collected their own soil samples (Appendix II, Table 11). Twenty-five percent used a consultant and 31% used a fertilizer or chemical dealer to collect samples. Eighty-four percent of adopters collected cores randomly within a grid or management zone, while only 16% pulled soil cores from around the center point of the grid or management zone.
The average management zone size was 18.8 acres (Appendix II, Table 12). On average, 18.6 soil cores were taken per management zone. The typical grid size for adopters averaged 5.8 acres. On average, 9.6 soil cores were taken per grid.
12

Variable Rate Input Application Technologies Cotton producers who had adopted some form of precision farming technology were
asked in question 9 about their use of variable rate application technologies on cotton. The majority of adopters did not use variable rate application technologies on cotton (Appendix II, Table 13). Forty-eight percent of responding adopters used variable rate lime application, followed by variable rate phosphorus and potassium application (39%), variable rate growth regulator application (24%), and variable rate nitrogen application (23%). The fewest responding adopter had used variable rate technology for manure application (5%), nematicide application (4%), and irrigation (3%).
For most variable rate input application technologies, more respondents reported decreases in input use than reported increases or no change in input use (Appendix II, Table 13). Of those responding adopters who used variable rate nitrogen application, 47% reported a decrease in nitrogen use, 24% reported and increase, and 29% reported no change in total nitrogen use. Sixty-four percent of responding adopters reported a decrease in total input use with variable rate phosphorus and potassium application. Another 14% reported a decrease in inputs, while 22% saw no affect on total phosphorous and potassium use. Seventy-four percent of responding adopters reported a decrease in total lime use when using variable rate application, with only 11% reporting an increase and 15% reporting no change in lime use. Total growth regulator use also decreased with variable rate application for 75% of responding adopters, while only 7% experienced an increase and another 16% experienced no change in growth regulator use.
Adopters were asked to indicate how their cotton yields changed following variable rate application (survey question 10). Thirty-seven percent of the 210 responding adopters
13

experienced a 97 lb/acre average increase in cotton lint yield, 9% reported a 166 lb/acre average decrease, and 54% indicated no change in cotton lint yield after variable rate input application (Appendix II, Table 14). Using these percentages of responding adopters to weight the average yield changes gives an estimated perceived lint yield increase of 21 lb/acre (0.37 x 97 lb/acre ­ 0.09 x 166 lb/acre). Precision Farming Equipment
Adopting producers were asked to list in question 12 any precision farming equipment they presently owned or leased, in what year it was purchased and the purchase price if the equipment was owned, and the lease rate in dollars per acre if it was leased. Adopters were also given an opportunity to list any problems they may have encountered with the equipment. Thirty-one respondents listed a total of 55 pieces of equipment. Among others, listed equipment included Ag Leader cotton and grain yield monitors, Zycon yield monitors, John Deere Greenstar yield monitors, a Terragator 1903 variable rate fertilizer spreader, another unnamed variable rate spreader, Trimble GPS receivers, computers dedicated to precision farming, and computer software.
Average purchase prices are not listed in this publication for several reasons. Respondents did not list the purchase prices for much of the equipment listed. In several cases when the price was listed, the equipment was purchased as an option on new equipment, such as a cotton picker or grain combine, and the total package price was listed. Also, prices are not listed to avoid discloser. Ten producers listed problems with their equipment. Among others, problems encountered by respondents included poor calibration and accuracy for some yield monitors, corrosion for fertilizer spreaders, broken wires, "Getting everything to talk to each other," and lack of a GPS signal.
14

Information Sources In survey question 13, adopters were asked to rate the helpfulness (1 = not helpful to 5 =
very helpful) of different information sources in learning about the precision farming technologies they had used or investigated. Average scores for farm dealers as a source of information were highest for learning about variable rate lime application (4.0), variable rate phosphorous and potassium application (3.9), grid soil sampling (3.8), and variable rate nitrogen application (3.4) (Appendix II, Table 15). Information gathered from farm dealers was not helpful for remote sensing with aerial photography (1.9) and satellite imagery (2.2), mapping topography, slope, soil depth, etc. (2.0), and soil survey maps (2.2).
In Table 16 (Appendix II), results show that crop consultants were most helpful in learning about grid soil sampling (3.9), plant tissue testing (3.7), and variable rate nitrogen (3.7), phosphorus and potassium (3.7), and lime (3.6) applications. They provided the least helpful information in learning about remote sensing with aerial photography (2.5) and satellite imagery (2.9), soil survey maps (2.9), and yield monitoring with (3.0) and without (3.0) GPS.
Adopters considered Extension/universities helpful sources of information in learning about variable rate insecticide application (4.3), management zone soil sampling (4.1), mapping topography, slope, soil depth, etc. (4.1), soil survey maps (4.0), plant tissue testing (4.0), and variable rate defoliant application (4.0), and least helpful in learning about yield monitoring without GPS (3.3), remote sensing with aerial photography (3.6), and variable rate fungicide application (3.6) (Appendix II, Table 17). Without exception, cotton producers who had adopted precision farming technologies considered Extension/universities at least moderately important in learning about these technologies.
15

Other farmers were not generally rated as helpful sources of information in learning about precision farming technologies. Average scores were highest for yield monitoring with GPS (3.1), yield monitoring without GPS (2.9), and yield monitoring without a yield monitor (2.8) (Appendix II, Table 18). Lowest scores were for remote sensing with aerial photography (1.6) and satellite imagery (1.7), plant tissue testing (1.7), soil survey maps (2.0), and variable rate insecticide application (2.0).
Most adopters indicated that trade shows were not helpful sources of information in learning about precision farming technologies (Appendix II, Table 19). With the exceptions of yield monitoring with GPS (2.7) and yield monitoring without a yield monitor (2.0), all average scores were less than 2.0. Similarly, the Internet and news media were not considered helpful sources of information (Appendix II, Tables 20 and 21). For the Internet, the only average scores above 2.0 were for yield monitoring with GPS (2.2), variable rate insecticide application (2.2), and remote sensing with aerial photography (2.1). For the news media, the only average score above 2.0 was for yield monitoring with GPS (2.7).
Table 22 (Appendix II) summarizes the average scores for learning about all precision farming technologies across all responding adopters. Extension/universities (3.86), crop consultants (3.37), and farm dealers (3.10) were the most helpful sources of information, while the news media (1.68), the Internet (1.75), and trade shows (1.79) were the least helpful in learning about precision farming technologies. Precision Farming Services
In question 14 of the survey, adopting producers were asked if they used the services of a farmers' cooperative, a technical consultant, a custom applicator, extension service, or others to
16

perform any precision farming task. Sixty percent of responding adopters had used off-farm precision farming services (Appendix II, Table 23).
Precision farming adopters who had used off-farm precision farming services were asked to identify the services they had used or employed and the cost of those services (survey question 15). Most responding adopters reported receiving management and technical advice concerning two-thirds of the technologies listed in survey question 15 (Appendix II, Table 24). Less than half of respondents reported receiving advice for yield monitoring without GPS, yield monitoring without a yield monitor, remote sensing with satellite imagery, on-the-go sensing, and variable rate seed, fungicide, and irrigation. The largest majority (92%) of responding adopters received advice concerning grid soil sampling. The average cost of advice on grid soil sampling was $3.88/acre and $2.00/acre for management zone soil sampling. Yield monitoring with and without GPS cost $5.44 and $3.50/acre, respectively. Average cost for advice on soil survey maps was $2.50/acre, and for variable rate lime application it was $5.00/acre. Except for remote sensing with aerial photography and variable rate herbicide application, most responding adopters indicated that they would purchase the advice again.
Custom services hired by adopters are presented in Appendix II, Table 25. Grid soil sampling was most popular with 100 of 105 responding adopters who reported hiring this service. Variable rate lime application (44 of 48 responding adopters hiring this service) and variable rate phosphorous and potassium application (41 of 45 hiring the service) were the next most hired precision farming services. Management zone soil sampling (22 of 27), plant tissue testing (21 of 25), and yield monitoring with GPS (15 of 23) were other services hired. Per-acre cost for these services ranged from $8.00/acre for remote sensing using aerial photos to $1.74/acre for plant tissue testing. The average costs of custom hiring services for yield
17

monitoring with GPS, grid soil sampling, and management zone soil sampling were $4.88, $5.90, $2.21/acre, and for variable rate nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and lime they were $4.33, $5.89, and $5.09/acre, respectively. Most responding adopters said they would hire these services again. Changes in Profit and Environmental Quality
Questions 16 through 19 of the survey dealt with adopter perceptions about the economic and environmental consequences of precision farming. Seventy-five percent of responding adopters thought precision farming was profitable (question 16) on their fields (Appendix II, Table 26). Adopters who found precision farming unprofitable were given an opportunity in question 17 to list the technologies they planned to discontinue. Twenty-one cotton producers responded to this question. Seven respondents said they would discontinue all precision farming; three said they would discontinue grid or management zone soil sampling; two said they would discontinue variable rate input applications; one indicated that satellite imagery would be discontinued; and one indicated that he/she would discontinue hiring services and do the work in-house.
Thirty-eight percent of adopters thought they had experienced an improvement in environmental quality (question 18) as a result of precision farming (Appendix II, Table 26). In question 19, adopters were given an opportunity to list the improvements in environmental quality they had observed. Sixty-five producers answered this question. Responses included, "less nitrogen use", "less residual nitrogen", "lower fertilizer rates", "less fertilizer run-off", "better drainage", "leaving out areas that are not profitable", "better soil texture-tilth", "more organic matter", "less spraying", "water quality", and "not farming erodible land".

Adopter and Non-Adopter Responses about Precision Farming Future of Precision Farming
Questions 20, 21, and 23 asked all producers about the future of precision farming. They were asked in questions 20 and 21 if they thought precision farming would be profitable for them to use in the future, and if so, would they prefer to own or rent the equipment. Eighty-five percent of adopting producers and 63% of non-adopting producers thought precision farming would be profitable for them to use in the future (Appendix II, Table 27). For those respondents who believed it would be profitable, 62% of adopters and 52% of non-adopters would prefer to own the precision farming equipment.
Question 23 gave respondents an opportunity to rate the importance of precision farming for several crops for the next five years. The level of importance ranged from 1 (not important) to 5 (very important). Responding cotton producers rated the importance of precision farming five years in the future the highest for cotton (3.6) and the lowest for tobacco (2.7). All crops except tobacco received an average score of 3.0 or higher. Except for rice, adopters rated the importance of precision farming five years in the future higher than did non-adopters (Appendix II, Table 28). For cotton, the average scores for adopters and non-adopters were 3.9 and 3.5, respectively; for corn they were 3.6 and 3.2; for peanuts they were 3.4 and 3.1; for rice they were 3.0 and 3.2; for soybeans they were 3.1 and 2.9; for tobacco they were 2.8 and 2.7; and for wheat they were 3.2 and 3.0, respectively. Perceived Price of a Cotton Yield Monitoring System
In question 22, producers were asked to report their best estimates of the typical purchase price for a cotton yield monitoring system with GPS. The average purchase price given by adopters was $8,776, while the average price given by non-adopters was $1,215 less at $7,561
19

(Appendix II, Table 29). These average prices were less than the list price of $9,500 that prevailed at the time of the survey for a cotton yield monitoring system that included a monitor, a GPS receiver, and sensors on two chutes of a 4-5-row picker (Ag Leader technology, 2001). Willingness to Purchase a Cotton Yield Monitoring System
In question 30, all cotton farmers were asked if they owned a cotton picker, and if they did, they were asked to indicate if they owned a 4, 5, or 6-row picker. The purpose of this question was to determine if the respondent was a candidate for retrofitting a yield monitoring system. Seventy-four percent of adopters and 69% of non-adopters owned a cotton picker (Appendix II, Table 30). Of the adopters who responded to the second part of question 30, 77% owned a four-row cotton picker, 7% owned a five-row picker, and 16% owned a six-row picker. Eighty-nine percent of responding non-adopters owned a four-row picker, 5% owned a five-row picker, 6% owned a six-row picker. Thus, adopters tended to own larger cotton pickers than non-adopters.
Table 31 (Appendix II) reports respondents' willingness to purchase a yield monitoring system for their 4-5-row cotton picker at specified dollar amounts (survey question 31). The percentage of respondents willing to purchase the yield monitoring system was inversely related to the price. For example, as the price increased, the number of respondents willing to purchase the system decreased. The percentages of respondents in the "Don't know" and "Don't own a 45-row picker" categories remained about the same as the price increased. Price appears to affect farmers' willingness to purchase a cotton yield monitoring system to retrofit on an existing picker.
Survey question 32 asked all cotton farmers if they were considering purchasing or leasing a new cotton picker. The purpose of this question was to determine if the respondent was
20

a candidate for purchasing or leasing an optional yield monitoring system with the new picker. Twenty-five percent of responding adopters and 12% of responding non-adopters were considering purchasing or leasing a new picker (Appendix II, Table 30). Fifty-nine percent, 3%, and 38% of responding adopters were considering purchasing 4-row, 5-row, and 6-row pickers, respectively, while 72%, 3%, and 25% of responding non-adopters were considering these new picker alternatives. Results suggest that adopters tended to favor purchasing or leasing larger cotton pickers than non-adopters.
Table 32 (Appendix II) reports respondents' willingness to purchase or lease an optional yield monitoring system when they purchase or lease a new 4, 5, or 6-row cotton picker at specified dollar amounts (survey question 33). The data show a trend downward in the percentage of farmers who would be willing to purchase or lease an optional yield monitoring system as the price increases. An upward trend also exists in the percentage of respondents who were unwilling to purchase or lease the system. These trends are not as pronounced as for the case of retrofitting a yield monitoring system on an existing picker. Nevertheless, the price of a cotton yield monitoring system appears to affect farmers' willingness to pay for the system when purchasing or leasing a new picker. Respondent and Farm Characteristics for Adopters and Non-Adopters Farm Characteristics
Respondents were asked to describe their farm in 2000 (questions 24 through 26). On average, precision farming adopters managed 2,297 acres, with 1,063 acres owned, 399 acres share rented under a two-year rental agreement, and 835 acres cash rented under a two-year rental agreement. Compared with adopters, acres managed by non-adopters was lower at 1,337
21

acres, with 523 acres owned, 239 acres share rented for two years, and 575 acres cash rented for two years (Appendix II, Table 33).
In survey question 27, producers were asked to provide the county where the majority of their farm was located. Results for question 27 are not reported here but are reported in the individual state reports.
Producers reported acres planted and estimated yields for the crops they produced in 1999 and 2000 (survey question 28). On average, adopters planted 1,133 acres of cotton in 1999 with an average lint yield of 790 lb/acre (Appendix II, Table 34). Non-adopters planted 663 acres per farm in 1999, nearly one-half the acres planted by adopters. Cotton lint yield averaged 685 lb/acre for non-adopters, which was 105 lb/acre less than the average yield obtained by adopters. On average, planted cotton acreage and lint yield increased in 2000 for both responding groups (Appendix II, Table 35). Adopters planted 1,175 acres per farm yielding 865 lb/acre, while non-adopters received an average lint yield of 749 lb/acre on 699 acres per farm. Again in 2000, adopters planted about twice as many acres of cotton as non-adopters. Considering crops other than cotton, planted acres were higher for adopters than non-adopters in both years, except for tobacco. Crop yields were also higher for adopters than non-adopters, except for soybean yields in 1999 (Appendix II, Tables 34 and 35).
Producers were asked to provide annual average yields for the most productive one-third, the average, and the least productive one-third of typical crop fields they farmed (question 29). Adopters reported similar or higher yields than non-adopters for all crops in all three yield categories (Appendix II, Table 36). Results suggest that adopters perceived greater yield variability within a typical field for a given crop than non-adopters. For example, the difference between mean yields reported by adopters for the most productive one-third and the least
22

productive one-third of a typical cotton field was 559 lb/acre (1,148 lb/acre - 589 lb/acre), while this difference was 520 lb/acre (1,053-533 lb/acre) for non-adopters. As another example, for a typical corn field, these yield ranges were 104 bu/acre (191-87 bu/acre) and 79 bu/acre (163-84 bu/acre) for adopters and non-adopters, respectively.
Table 37 (Appendix II) presents producers' responses to survey question 34 concerning livestock. A slightly larger percentage of adopters (37%) than non-adopters (33%) reported owning livestock. Thirty-one percent of adopters and 22% of non-adopters reported applying manure to their fields. Respondent Characteristics
Producers were queried about their ages, years of farming experience, education, and computer usage (survey questions 35 through 38). The average age (question 35) of a precision farming adopter was 48 years and ranged from 25 to 78 years. Non-adopters averaged 51 years of age, ranging from 21 to 92 years (Appendix II, Table 38). Precision farming adopters had farmed an average of 25 years, while non-adopters had farmed an average of 28 years (survey question 36). Years of farming ranged from three to 63 years for adopters and two to 78 years for non-adopters (Appendix II, Table 38). The overwhelming majority of adopters (97%) and non-adopters (95%) completed high school (question 37). On average, responding adopters had completed more college (three years) than responding non-adopters (two years) (Appendix II, Table 39). The majority of adopters (86%) and non-adopters (74%) owned a computer (question 38) (Appendix II, Table 40). Seventy-four percent of adopters used the computer for farm management, compared with 55% of non-adopters (question 38).
Question 39 asked cotton farmers if farming was their primary source of income (Appendix II, Tables 41, 42, and 43). Farming was the primary source of income for the vast
23

majority of precision farming adopters (80%) (Appendix II, Table 42), and the same was found for non-adopters, although a slightly smaller percentage of non-adopters depended on farming as their primary source of income (76%) (Appendix II, Table 43). The percentage of responding adopters with farming as their primary source of income was lowest for the $100,000-to$149,999 category (63%) and highest for the $500,000-or-greater category (90%). The percentage of responding non-adopters with farming as their primary source of income was lowest for the $50,000-to-$99,999 category (71%) and highest for the $500,000-or-greater category (93%).
Precision farming adopters tended to have higher household incomes than non-adopters (survey question 41) (Appendix II, Tables 42 and 43). Fifty-nine percent of responding adopters had total household incomes less than $100,000, while 63% of non-adopters had incomes below $100,000. At the other end of the income scale, 21% of adopters had total household incomes greater than or equal to $200,000, while 16% of non-adopters had incomes in this category.
Survey question 42 asked cotton producers to provide the percentages of their total household incomes from farming. Averaged over all respondents, 69 percent of total household income came from farming (Appendix II, Table 41). Adopters tended to rely more heavily on farm income than non-adopters. Responding adopters reported an average of 72% of their income coming from farming (Appendix II, Table 42), while non-adopters reported 66% of their income coming from farming (Appendix II, Table 43).
Producers indicated the one statement that best described their farm-planning goal. Fiftythree percent of adopters and 52% of non-adopters stated their farm-planning goal was to "acquire enough farm assets to generate sufficient income for family living." Twenty-five percent of adopters wanted to "expand the size of operation through acquiring additional
24

resources," while 14% of non-adopters had this as their major farm-planning goal. The percentages of adopters and non-adopters who were "thinking about retirement and transfer of farm to the next generation" were 16 and 28%, respectively. Smaller percentages of adopters (5%) and non-adopters (7%) were "considering selling the farm and moving on to a different career."
Conclusions This report provides information about the use of precision farming technologies by cotton farmers in six southern states. It also provides information about farmers' attitudes toward the use, importance, and profitability of precision farming in the future. Farmers can use this information to help assess technology options and make precision farming technology adoption decisions. Survey results provide insight into several factors that determine whether or not a farmer will adopt precision farming technologies. Some of those factors are discussed below. Cotton producers who have adopted precision farming technologies tended to have larger scale farming operations. Farming operations for adopters averaged 2,297 acres, compared with 1,337 acres for non-adopters. Larger operations allow fixed investment costs associated with technology adoption to be spread over more acres, reducing per-acre production costs. Adopters had invested more time in developing human capital through education. A larger percentage of adopters had completed high school (97% versus 95%), and adopters who attended college averaged three years of college compared with two years for non-adopters. The information technologies associated with precision farming are more complex than traditional farming practices. Producers with more education may be more innovative and better able to adjust to new technologies.
25

The average age of adopters was 48 years, compared with 51 years for non-adopters. Younger farmers have more years before retirement, giving them more incentive to adopt precision farming technologies because they have more years to reap the potential benefits from the investment.
Computers were used for farm management by 74% of adopters and 55% of nonadopters. Producers who own and use a computer for farm management may be more able to process the complex data sets generated by precision faming technologies into useful information for making management decisions.
Tenure arrangements can influence the adoption of new technologies. Adopters owned 46% of the land they farmed, while non-adopters owned 39% of the land they farmed. Farmers who own more of the land they farm may be more likely to adopt new technologies, especially if they perceive that using the new technologies will help them maintain the quality of the land and the environment.
Adopters tended to farm better quality cotton land than non-adopters. Cotton lint yields for adopters averaged 790 lb/acre, compared with 685 lb/acre for non-adopters. Better quality land has higher organic matter content, deeper topsoil, and other qualities that enhance water availability to the crop. Better water availability provides greater potential for yield response to larger amounts of production inputs. Potential cost savings and environmental benefits from more accurate placement of inputs are higher when field average input levels are higher.
Adopters appeared to be more knowledgeable about the cost of precision farming technologies. In the survey, adopters were more accurate in their estimate of the cost of a cotton yield monitoring system. For adopters, the average estimate for the price of a cotton yield monitoring system ($8,776) was only $724 less than the list price at the time of the survey
26

($9,500), while the average estimate for non-adopters ($7,561) was $1,939 less than the list price.
Attitudes toward the future of precision farming can affect a farmer's willingness to adopt of these technologies. Eighty-five percent of adopters thought precision farming would be profitable for them to use in the future, while 63% of non-adopters thought it would be profitable. When asked about the importance of precision farming during the next five years, adopters rated cotton precision farming 3.9 and non-adopters rated it 3.5 (1 = not important and 5 = very important).
Cotton producers are confronted every day with information concerning the rapidly growing precision farming industry. As more information becomes available, cotton producers will have greater opportunities to make informed decisions about the use of these technologies. Findings from this and other studies that investigate the current use and future prospects for precision farming technologies are important to cotton producers because they provide the needed information for making better decisions about the adoption of these technologies. For example, through this research farmers can discover the precision farming technology options available to them, the extent to which those options have been adopted by their peers, and the attitudes of their peers about the importance and profitability of precision farming in the future.
