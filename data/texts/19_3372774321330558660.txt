Abstracts. The model of associative memory is proposed in this paper based on concept of association between
images  and  associative  search.  This  model  may  be  used  for  connect  concept  of  inference  with  associative
processing in neural networks.

Keywords. Intelligent systems, knowledge base, associative memory, associative search.

A  main  problem  of  knowledge  processing  in  intelligent  system,  is  the  problem  of
search  of  relevant  knowledge  or,  in  other  words,  recovery  of  a  fragment  of  knowledge
(image) on its fuzzy or noisy sample.

In  Prolog-similar  systems  the  search  of  relevant  knowledge  is  implemented  as
unification. In frame systems the problem of search is implemented as comparison (matching)
of the frames. In semantic networks the search implements by comparison of fragments of a
network and graph-inquiry.

All these methods of search can be reduced to one, which is, apparently, implemented
in  natural  intelligent  systems,  -  associative  fuzzy  search  of  knowledge  by  its  fragment.
Knowledge here is meant as associative connections between images.

Let be follows:

-  Set of features K={pi}| i=1,Np, describing state of environment and self intelligent system

in time t, where Np – the number of features,

-  Set  of  combination  of  values  of  features  on  set  K  P0={Pj}  |  Pj={pij}  |  j=1,No,  i=1,Np,

describing concrete images, where No – number of images,

-  Set of real images (not full set of features) P={Pkj} | j=1,No and k is integer from (1,Np),
-  Query (image, initializing associative search) P∈P,
- 

Image-result of associative search R∈P.

The definition of “real” images P at contra to set of “ideal” images P0 have principle
mean. Natural intelligent system practically always deals with not full data about environment
and internal state. Based on ones she restores missing data and restore associatively connected
with ones another images (last or next in time). This process based on associative restoring is
the principle of thinking. Must be selected two different processes:
-  The process of restoration of image by partially determined features. Usually this process

is simulated in different models of associative memory;

-  The process of searching of associatively connected images linked with other moments of

time. These images matter as reasons or consequences of initial image.

First  variant  is  implemented  in  natural  intelligent  systems  in  sensor  subsystems  of
brain.  Second  –  in  neocortex  and  is  main  for  forecasting  and  thinking  of  animal  or  man.
Below the model of this variant is proposed.

The features of set K may be considered as numbers determined on metric scales.
Definition 1. The pair of images (P,R) refers to as association A or A(P,R), predicate
Ξ(Pa,Ra,Ta),  describing  process  of  restoring  of  Ra  |  Ra  ⊆  R  by  Pa  |  Pa  ⊆  P,  is  called  as
associative search, Pa – initial image of associative search and Ra - final image of associative

search, Ta – duration of associative search. For all Pa and Ra Ξ(Pa,Ra,Ta)=true, if Pa=P and
If intelligent system acts in discrete time, then Ta ∈(1,N).
Ra=R, Ξ(Pa,Ra,Ta)=false, if Pa=∅. 
Definition 2. Set of associations A={Ai(Pi,Ri)} | i∈(1,M) forms memory or knowledge

base of intelligent system.

Definition 3. Such associative search Ξ(Pa,Ra,Ta), as it use only one association from
memory  A=(P,R)  |  Pa⊆P,  Ra⊆R,,  refers  to  as  elementary  associative  search.  In  case  of
discrete time to elementary associative search there corresponds duration Ta=1 (One step). In
this case the elementary associative search may be described as Ξ(Pa,Ra).

Definition  4.  The  associative  search  accepting  value  true  let’s  name  successful  and

false – Unsuccessful.

a,Ri

a⊆P and Ri

a,Ta)}, where Pi

To  every  association  A=(P,R)  corresponds  set  of  successful  associative  searchs
Ω={Ξi(Pi
a ⊆R. Formation of this set depends from features of
implementation  of  associative  memory  (in  particular,  match  of  initial  image  of  associative
search Pi

a  with P). Predicate describing matching of two images let’s designate  as ≈.
Definition  5.  Association,  to  which  there  corresponds  set  of  successful  associative
searches Ω, which capacity is equal 1, refers to as the determined association. If the capacity
of set Ω is more 1, the association refers to as fuzzy.

Definition 6. Let's name association and associative search connected, if on attributes

the following restriction is imposed:

P ⊆

R

Definition 7. Let's name association and associative search free, if any restrictions on

sets P and R is not imposed.

The set from N of associations (Pi,R) / i∈(1,N), in which as set of features R the same
internal image is selected, is an elementary tree and element of hierarchical structures used for
classification of images.

The  process  of  thinking  in  the  certain  above  terms  of  associations  and  associative
search  can  be  presented  as  associative  search  (process  of  restoring)  images  initiated  by  an
initial  entrance  image,  consisting  from  external  features.  Generally  it  can  be  presented  as
associative search displayed in a chain or a tree of elementary associative searches. The tree
turns out, if on the next step there are associations, alternative for application.

May be selected two kinds of chains:

1)  A chain with forgetting, when all images restored as a result of the previous associative

searches, are not taken into account during current associative search;

2)  A chain with storing, when an initial image for the current associative search is the image
being a composition (in the elementary case, addition) of final images received on the
previous  steps  of  associative  search.  And  let  be  parameter  m  -  depth  of  storing  the
limiting account of a history of associative search (at m=0 a chain with storing turns to a
chain with forgetting).

At a chain with storing the size m associates with concept of capacity of short-term
memory used in psychology. It is considered, that volume of short-term memory makes 5-7
images.

It  is  possible  to  understand  a  composition  in  the  elementary  case  association  of
images.  In  this  case  identical  features  of  images  with  different  values  coexist  together.
However, more real represent variant when the different values of images of the same feature
cooperate  among  themselves.  For  simplification  of  formalization  and  further  realization  of
model the following variant of a composition of images from (i-m)-th to i-th is offered:

mk - the quantity of images, in which is present an feature pik,
pik=0, if к-th feature is absent in i-th image.
It  in  essence  means  calculation  average  arithmetic  among  the  values,  present  in
images, k-th of an feature. In case of a binary feature (with values from a range {0,1}) as its
value at a composition of images it is necessary to consider last value.

It is possible to present probable variants of development of associative search in case
of  presence  of  alternative  associations  or  set  of  alternative  successful  associative  searches
appropriate to associations, as a tree similar to a tree of the decisions in the classical theory of
artificial intelligence. However, is a static picture, which can be applied only to convenience
of understanding by the external observer. Actually, the receipt of external images initiating

process of associative search, occurs at the any moments of time. Therefore it is necessary to
speak about parallel associative search, the growth of which quantity is limited to volume of
short-term memory (parameter m).

In natural intelligent systems (in contrast majority of AI models) the process of

learning is not separated from process of reasoning or associative search.
Let's try to describe this process in the terms determined above.

The associations in memory arise constantly during perception of all new images of
the external world. But are remembered not all from them, but only what are supported during
the  associative  search,  caused  by  them.  It  is  possible  to  tell,  that  the  process  of  storing  is
supervised by earlier stored information.

During associative restoring at using of the next association (P, R) it becomes active
on time mTa  (in a case Ta=1 this size can be becomes replaced on m - volume of short-term
memory).  The  reinforcement  of  association  A=(P1,R1)  at  using  of  the  next  association
B=(P2,R2) during associative search occurs in case the following conditions are satisfied: 1)
the association A is active and 2) P2 ≈ R1.

That  disappears  under  the  term  “the  reinforcement  of  association",  depends  on
concrete implementation of associative memory (as well as the relation of provisional equality
of images.

If at receipt of some image from the external world the associative search, initiated by
it  does  not  result  in  success,  the  image  is  remembered  as  a  final  image  R1  of  association
A=(P1,R1), an initial image from which P1 is the previous image. This association becomes
active on time mTa .  If it is not supported during this time, this association is erased  from
memory. So occurs at primary forming of associative memory. Thus on the initial stage, when
still memory contains a few associations, the size of short-term memory m can have the large
value and decreases in process of forming of associative memory.

The model proposed in this paper may be used for development of architecture of

hybrid intelligent systems joining logical and associative processing of knowledge, in
particular so-called “semi-sphere intelligent systems”, proposed by author [1-3].
