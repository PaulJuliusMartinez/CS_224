I n developed countries, people who inject drugs (PWID) are the group
at highest risk of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV).1 Throughout
the 1990s, regulations restricting access to antiviral treatment for HCV
by PWID existed in many Western countries, although they were not evidence based.2

Abstract
Objectives: To develop a mathematical model to project the potential impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment on HCV infection prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID).
Design and setting: An existing model of HCV transmission among PWID was parameterised using data from Victoria, Australia, including specific parameter estimates of the number of people who are currently active injecting drug users, average duration of injecting, chronic HCV infection prevalence among PWID, annual mortality, and annual HCV treatment rate. We also explored the impact of prevalence uncertainty, program scale-up, and new treatments.
Main outcome measure: Prevalence of chronic HCV infection among people who are currently active injecting drug users.
Results: With annual treatment rates of 13, 17, or 25 per 1000 PWID, the model predicts relative prevalence reductions of 20%, 30%, and 50%, respectively, within 30 years. If new treatments giving higher sustained viral response rates are available in 5 years, estimated impact is increased by 21%­23% at 15 years, and 17%­38% at 30 years, depending on treatment rates.
Conclusions: This model suggests that modest rates of current HCV treatment among PWID in Victoria, Australia could halve HCV infection prevalence among PWID in 30 years. This finding suggests that interventions aimed at increasing access to HCV treatment in community clinics will benefit individual PWID and reduce HCV infection prevalence.

Methods
Mathematical model and
assumptions
A previously developed model of HCV transmission among PWID9,10 (fully described in the Appendix; online at mja.com.au) was parameterised using data from Victoria, Australia. It consists of differential equations that track change among PWID who are susceptible (never infected, or previously infected and underwent spontaneous or treatment-induced clearance); who have chronic HCV infection; who are currently receiving treatment; and who do not achieve a sustained viral response (SVR) after treatment (and cannot be retreated). Previous modelling indicated that the presence of immunity has a negligible effect on treatment impact,9,10 hence this model assumes no immunity. People who begin to inject drugs enter the susceptible pool and leave (by dying or ceasing to inject) at fixed rates. Susceptible PWID become infected at a rate proportional to infection risk and the prevalence of HCV among

PWID. PWID enter treatment at a fixed rate ( PWID with chronic HCV infection per 1000 PWID annually) unless the number infected is driven below , whereupon all PWID with chronic HCV infection are treated. The model does not explicitly model individual genotypes, but we weighted the average SVR rate and treatment duration to the genotype distribution in Victoria.
Model parameters
We a ssum ed tre at me nt wi th pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin leads to a 45% SVR rate for genotype 1 and 80% for genotype 2 or 3.11 A systematic review estimated that 26% of people with acute HCV infection spontaneously clear the disease.12
The baseline model included the Victorian estimates: population of PWID, 25 000 (based on the number of PWID enrolled in opioid substitution treatment in Victoria, and selfreported opioid substitution treatment uptake data from epidemiological studies);13,14 average duration of injecting, 14 years;6 prevalence of chronic HCV infection among PWID (as determined by a positive polymerase

(online at mja.com.au) contains a
table of parameters.

Baseline scenario
We identified the treatment rates necessary to reduce HCV infection prevalence among PWID by 20%, 30%, and 50% over 30 years, projecting the decrease in chronic infection prevalence at 5, 15, and 30 years. We determined the 15-year and 30-year relative prevalence reductions with annual treatment rates ranging from 5/1000 PWID to 40/1000 PWID.

Alternative scenarios
As estimates for baseline chronic infection prevalence among PWID in Victoria are uncertain, we explored the impact of lower (45%) and higher (55%) prevalences. Additionally, because of uncertainty in the average length of injecting and SVR rates among PWID, we examined scenarios with longer (16 years) and shorter (12 years) injecting durations (Appendix; online at mja.com.au).
As a substantial increase in treatment rates would require a gradual scale-up, we also explored a scenario where treatment increased linearly from baseline to the full treatment rate over 5 years. In this model, we explored the potential impact of new, direct-acting antiviral therapies with improved efficacy and shorter treatment

duration. We modelled scenarios with an 80% SVR rate and a 24-week treatment duration for all genotypes after year 5.
Finally, we examined a scenario where uptake increased because of new treatments with higher SVR rates and shorter duration. We compared treating 5/1000 PWID annually with baseline SVR rates to the following scenario: 5/1000 treated for 5 years with baseline SVR and treatment duration rates, followed by 20/ 1000 treated for the remaining years with an 80% SVR rate and 24 weeks of treatment.
Results
Our model predicted that reducing chronic HCV infection prevalence by 50% among PWID within 30 years (from 50% to 25%) could be achieved with an annual treatment rate of 625 PWID in Victoria (25/1000 PWID), including reductions in prevalence of 14% by 5 years and 32% by 15 years (Box 1). We also estimated the effect of treating 13/1000 and 17/1000 PWID annually (Box 1).
Box 2 shows the estimated relative reductions in prevalence at 15 and 30 years with varying annual treatment rates. Increasing annual treatment rates resulted in greater prevalence reductions at 30 years compared with 15 years, but above a rate of 30/1000 PWID the incremental impact plateaued (maximum relative prevalence reduction, approximately 70%) because many PWID become persistent non-responders with currently available treatments (Appendix; online at mja.com.au).
The reduced HCV infection prevalence among PWID remained when baseline HCV prevalence (Box 3) and average duration of injecting (Appendix; online at mja.com.au) varied, although higher baseline prevalences and shorter duration of injecting showed a reduced impact.
Introducing a 5-year scale-up period before reaching full treatment rates reduced the impact of treatment by 10%­14% at 15 years (Box 4, A), but the differences were minimal at 30 years (Box 4, B). If new treatments increased SVR to 80% and decreased treatment duration to 24 weeks for both genotypes after 5 years, the

estimated impact would increase by 20%­26% at 15 years, and 17%­38% by 30 years, depending on the scaleup strategy.
A benefit was predicted from new treatments resulting in higher SVR with shorter treatment durations when uptake was increased from 5/ 1000 to 20/1000 after 5 years (Box 5); the projected HCV infection prevalence was nearly half the baseline prevalence by 30 years. Maintaining the treatment rate at 5/1000 showed minimal impact (prevalence of 47% at 5 years and 46% at 30 years).

Discussion
Our modelling suggests that modest rates of HCV treatment among people who currently inject drugs could halve HCV infection prevalence among PWID in 30 years in Victoria. Although this is particularly relevant to Victoria, as the Victorian Government has recently funded ten HCV treatment nurses to work in community-based clinics in urban and regional Victoria, similar impacts on HCV infection prevalence are possible elsewhere in Australia. Our findings suggest that structuring clinics and nurses' roles to improve timely access to HCV treatment and to support adherence and treatment completion for PWID could produce considerable population-level reductions in HCV transmission. Moreover, new HCV treatment therapies are likely to become available soon, including

all patients, irrespective of viral geno-
type and their previous response to
therapy. Treatment length will decrease, as will drug side effects,20,21
further increasing the projected impact of treatment on HCV infection prevalence.20
In the past, concerns about treat-
ing PWID have included lack of
compliance with therapy, associated
drug resistance, and the potential for

reinfection.22 These concerns may
discourage clinicians from recommending HCV treatment and deter
health service bureaucrats from fund-
ing clinics that are appropriately
located and structured to meet the
complex health needs of PWID. A
recent Australian study of HCV treatment uptake and deferral, using data
from the Australian Chronic Hepati-
tis C Observational Study, identified
factors related to drug and alcohol
use rather than clinical factors as the
major influences on treatment uptake.23 A recent systematic review
of HCV treatment for PWID found
adequate levels of adherence in this
population and low levels of reinfection after successful treatment;24 and
a subsequent study of treatment of acute and early chronic hepatitis
reported high levels of adherence
regardless of reported injecting behaviour.25 Internationally, several
studies in a range of settings have
demonstated that successful treatment of current injectors is possible;6,26 one study reports high
treatment adherence, irrespective of
injecting drug use before or during therapy.6,25 Additionally, the rate of
reinfection after treatment has been shown to be low.27
Knowledge about HCV diagnosis
and management in the primary care setting in Australia is poor,28 and con-
siderable work is needed to ensure
primary care clinics can appropriately

manage HCV infection in PWID. However, Australian primary health care practitioners have considerable experience in managing complex chronic diseases affecting patients with multiple and complex health needs -- for example, diabetes, HIV and problems with mental health.29 With appropriate training and adequate resourcing it should be feasible for them to manage HCV infection in PWID, particularly if systems are developed to facilitate shared-care and timely referral of complex patients to HCV specialists.30
The model's prediction that treating people who currently inject drugs will reduce prevalence and HCV transmission despite risk of reinfection suggests that it is worthwhile funding the treatment of HCV infection in PWID, even if managing this group is resource-intensive.31 Such a policy would involve locating HCV nurses in primary care services attended by a high proportion of PWID and ensuring that other support services are available, including mental health, drug and alcohol, social welfare, housing and peer support.
Our study has limitations. While estimates for the model parameters

were generated from multiple data sources, injecting drug use is a highly stigmatised and typically hidden behaviour, so the number of PWID in Victoria and mean duration of injecting are uncertain. Our findings are based on a predictive model rather than experimental evidence or observations in other communities, and assumes that, after scale-up, treatment rates will be constant for 30 years (for example, 625 PWID treated annually); however, as HCV infection prevalence decreases, so may demand for HCV treatment. Conversely, increasing awareness and improvement of treatment may lead to increased treatment uptake. We assumed that the rate of initiation to injecting remains constant over time. The population of PWID may increase due to general population growth or decrease due to changing drug-use patterns, although numbers in Victoria have been stable over the past 15 years.32
Finally, the model assumes that risky injecting behaviours and HCV infection prevalence are homogenously distributed among PWID and that all infected PWID have equal probability of HCV acquisition, treatment access, and treatment success. Assuming population heterogeneity in HCV risk and treatment accessibility may lead to the model overestimating the impact of treating 625 PWID annually.
PWID are at greatest risk of acquiring and transmitting HCV infection, but very few are being treated. Because of the high risk of onward transmission, even modest increases in treatment rates in this group may lead to considerable population-level reductions in HCV infection prevalence. Particularly when considered in combination with the value of treatment to individuals, this finding suggests there are real benefits in investing additional resources in treating PWID.
