A growing literature seeks to explain the observation that natural resource abundant economies have slower growth than resource scarce economies. Using a two-sector open economy model with perfect competition and non-increasing returns to variable inputs, we show that the "curse of natural resources" is the expected outcome for economies producing exhaustible resources. We show, however, that while natural resource production negatively influences the growth rate of per capita income, it raises the level of per capita income, so long as the economic rents are not fully dissipated. The paper also shows how other explanations such as Dutch disease effects and insecurity of property rights can be incorporated into the model.

1. Introduction
Sachs and Warner (1995, 1999, 2001) show that over the last 35 years, economies that are dependent on natural resource exports have grown slower than resource scarce economies. They have dubbed this observation the "curse of natural resources" and there is a growing literature seeking to explain this surprising outcome. In this paper, we show that the resource curse occurs in competitive exhaustible resource markets as a result of the intertemporal optimization decisions made by owners of the resource stock.
The evidence for the resource curse comes from adding measures of resource abundance to the conditional convergence growth models as estimated by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991) and Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992). Sachs and Warner (1995) use as their measure of resource abundance the share of GDP represented by the value of primary products for export. They find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of primary product exports to GDP in 1971 of 0.134 decreases expected growth over the next 20 years by almost one percent per year.1
1 The curse has also been found in Leite and Weidmann (1999), Atkinson and Hamilton (2003), Bulte, Damania and Deacon (2003), Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003), and Papyrakis and Gerlagh (2004). An important exception to the robustness of these results is Stijns (2001), who finds no relationship between the reserves of energy and mineral resources and economic growth between 1970 and 1989.

Sachs and Warner (2001) summarize the general strategy for finding the explanation as one of searching for the way in which natural resource exploitation crowds out activity some x, where activity x drives growth. There are many candidates for activity x. Sachs and Warner (2001) observe that natural resource intensive economies have had smaller contributions from exports of manufactures to overall GDP growth and natural resource intensive economies tend to have high price levels. They consider manufacturing to be the sector in which technical progress, which sustains growth, is most likely to occur. Other authors have modeled the harm to the economy as arising from the manufacturing sector being characterized by external economies in production.2 In these so-called "Dutch disease" models, crowding out of manufacturing activity is the way in which natural resource exploitation harms the economy. Not only is the growth rate of the economy slower because of natural resource abundance, but in the long run, the level of per capita income is lower than it would have been in the absence of the natural resource sector. Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003), Bulte, Damania, and Deacon (2003) find little empirical support for Dutch disease arguments.
Gylfason et al. (1999), Gylfason (2000), and Bravo-Ortega and De Gregorio (2001) propose that x is human capital, observing that public expenditures on school and school enrolment rates are inversely related to natural resource abundance. Auty (2001) suggests that high rents result in resource-abundant economies being less vigilant about using resources efficiently, providing lower levels of investment in human and social capital, being more prone to trade policy closures due to Dutch Disease effects and the strong influence of interest groups benefiting from trade closure. Atkinson and Hamilton (2003) argue that the inefficiency is in how resource rents are

2 For example, learning by doing in Matsuyama (1992) and Torvik (2001), and increasing returns to scale in manufacturing in Rodriguez and Sachs (1999).

used by society.3
Others suggest that x is corruption due to non-productive rent-seeking to capture natural
resource rents. Leite and Weidmann (1999) argue the linkage between corruption and resources
is indirect. Those countries with `point sources' of resources--e.g., oil fields--are easily
expropriated, so those countries have governments that are tempted into rent-seeking and
possible corruption rather than pro-growth activities. Papyrakis and Gerlagh (2004) find that
rent-seeking accounts for about 40% of the indirect effect through institutional quality, and that
this is much larger than the (positive) direct effect of natural resources. Sala-i-Martin and
Subramanian (2003) and Bulte, Damania, and Deacon (2004) find no evidence in support of a
direct link between growth and natural resource abundance but they do find an indirect link through the relationship between resource abundance and institutional quality.4 They also find
that institutional quality is the likely indirect channel through which natural resources lower
growth.
Finally, Wright and Czelusta (2004) argue that for the United States, the most dramatic technical change in the 19th century took place in natural resource production.5 Thus, if resource
abundant economies display slow growth, it reflects institutions that inhibit technical change in
the resource sector. In this view, resource abundant countries that are poor lack the necessary
institutions to develop with or without natural resource (Olson Jr. 1996).
3 The measure of savings used in their paper is the "genuine savings rate," which deducts the depletion of resources. Neumayer (2004) uses an `El Serafy' measure of resource rent to estimate a similar model to that estimated by Atkinson and Hamilton. The El Serafy method measures resource rents as (pr - AC)qr(1+)+1, where pr is the resource price, AC is the average cost, qr is the resource production,  is the discount rate, and  is the ratio of reserves to production. 4 Measures of institutional quality used in the literature include the World Banks' "rule of law", "voice and accountability in government", and "government effectiveness" indices. Bulte, Damania, and Deacon (2003) use several indicators of human development, including percent of the population that is undernourished, the percent that lives in poverty, percent of children underweight, and life expectancy at birth. 5 See Barnett and Morse (1963), Slade (1982) and Krautkraemer (1998) for evidence that this continued in the 20th century for most commodities.

Sachs and Warner (2001, 833) conclude that there is no definitive explanation for the curse:
Since there is a diversity of views regarding the second of these statements (what exactly drives growth), we have a similar diversity of views on the natural resource question. In other words, a complete answer to what is behind the curse of natural resources therefore awaits a better answer to the question about what ultimately drives growth.
We offer an alternative explanation for the resource curse. Rather than viewing the resource
curse as a crowding out phenomenon, we show that the resource curse results from decreasing
total rents in the resource sector. Our model is a dynamic general equilibrium model of a small
open economy with constant returns to scale in a manufacturing sector and a resource sector with a decreasing marginal product to the one variable input, labor.6 While Hotelling's rule (1931) for
an exhaustible resource states that marginal rents are rising over time at the rate of return to
capital, total rents are decreasing over time. The explanation we present for the resource curse
does not require institutional failure, nor that economic activities characterized by non-
convexities be crowded out. All of these proposed explanations for the curse can have
deleterious effects on growth but they are not necessary to provide an explanation for the slower
growth of resource abundant economies. Our simple framework also allows us to demonstrate
that an important effect of bad or corrupt policy is to lower the income of the fixed factor.
Our model is empirically distinguishable from others in the literature through predictions of
the effects of natural resources on income levels. Crowding out or institutional quality
explanations for the curse explain slower growth as the product of resources limiting the size of a
manufacturing sector characterized by positive external economies (e.g., learning by doing or
learning spillovers) or increasing returns to scale. These models predict that over the long run,
6 The simplest form of this model has already been presented by Chambers and Gordon (1966). In their model, the resource sector was agriculture, with a fixed input of land. The key feature of their model was that labor is mobile between the sectors. Thus, when the agricultural sector experienced a boom (a one-time increase in marginal productivity of labor in their model), labor flowed into the agricultural sector and out of the manufacturing sector. Chambers and Gordon demonstrated that a resource boom results in higher employment in the resource sector, higher GDP, and higher returns for the fixed factor land. However, the only sustained increase in per capita GDP in their model is due to exogenous productivity growth in the non-resource sector.
5

natural resource exploitation reduces the level of per capita income below what it would have been in the absence of natural resource exploitation. In contrast, our model predicts that over the long run, per capita incomes in the economy converge from above to the income level associated with a non-resource economy. If our model provides the correct explanation for the resource curse, then it should be the case that over the long run measures of initial resource abundance are negatively correlated with growth rates, but positively correlated or uncorrelated with per capita income levels. Crowding out explanations such as those identified by Sachs and Warner (2001) would be supported by a negative correlation between per capita incomes and measures of resource abundance.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and the two fundamental results regarding growth and level effects of the resource curse. Section 3 extends the model to include institutional failures. Section 4 extends the model to include a non-traded sector to examine Dutch Disease arguments. Section 5 discusses the implications our model has for empirical estimation. Section 6 concludes.
2. A Two-Sector Model with Exhaustible Resources
We consider a simple dynamic two-sector open economy with an exhaustible resource sector and a manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector earns constant and exogenous price pm and has a constant-returns-to-scale technology. Manufacturing production is described by M = BLm, where B(t)Lm(t) is the number of effective labor units working in manufacturing in period t, and  is a positive constant.7 The function B(t) represents labor-augmenting technological progress, and B(t) = B(0)egt, so technological change occurs exogenously at rate g. In a cross-sectional analysis of growth rates in different countries, initial differences in B(0) may account for

differences in incomes. L(t) = L(0)ent is the available labor at time t, and grows at rate n, the net (births minus deaths) population growth rate. The resource sector earns the world price, pr, which, for simplicity, is assumed to be constant over time, and operates with the production function Q = f(BLr) = (BLr), where 0 <  < 0, and B(t)Lr(t) is the amount of effective labor units used in the resource sector in period t.
Given constant returns to scale in manufacturing, the economy will always be in a state of full employment. The allocation of labor across the two sectors is defined by

(1) Lr(t) + Lm(t) = L(t). The resource sector reserves at time t are R(t). Reserves are depleted at rate (BLr):

(2)

dR dt



 R

=

-(BLr),

R(0) = R0 and R(T)  0.

We assume that reserves are privately owned, and there are no externalities created by this industry. Thus, the model is an input variation of the model of Hotelling (1931). The market for reserve ownership is assumed to be perfectly competitive and capital markets require a rate of return equal to , the return to capital in international markets.
The problem faced by the competitive producer in the resource sector is to select the quantity of labor hired at each instant in time to maximize the present value of resource rents

T
(3) PV = e-t[pr(BLr) - wBLr]dt, 0

subject to the resource constraints (3). We assume that L is sufficiently large so that Lr < L. Then the wage, wB, paid to labor is equal to the value of the marginal product of labor in manufacturing. This wage is rising over time as the productivity of labor increases.

7

The manufacturing contribution to gross domestic product is Ym = pmBLm. Income per

worker in manufacturing is given by ym  Ym/Lm = pmB. The resource contribution to GDP is Yr = pr(BLr). Per capita income in the resource sector is, yr  Yr/Lr = pr(BLr)-1B. Income in this

economy is thus Y = Yr + Ym, so per worker income can be written as

(4)

y



Y L

=

yrLLr

+

ym1 - LLr,

where Lr/L and (1 - Lr/L) = Lm/L are the shares of labor employed in the resource and manufacturing sectors, respectively.

For the resource sector to be in equilibrium, three conditions must hold. First, at each instant

in time, Hotelling's rule (1931) must hold, which implies that the current marginal profits in the

resource sector must grow at rate  for firms to be indifferent between selling the resource at

time t and at a later time. This condition can be expressed as:

(5)

pr

-

w (BLr)-1

= et,

where , a positive valued constant, is the competitive price for the resource stock, which equals the present value of resource rents, and w/(BLr)1- is the marginal cost of extraction. Equation (5) is an arbitrage equation of the form  =  /, which says the capital gains to holding oil in the ground (the rate of change of marginal profits) equals the rate of return elsewhere in the economy. The marginal cost of extraction is increasing in BLr since the marginal product of labor is decreasing in BLr. Equation (5) is the intertemporal optimization condition in a resource economy.
If the resource sector is in equilibrium, then two other conditions must hold at the moment when the resource is exhausted. The first of these conditions is simply an accounting condition

8

that ensures that at some the time 0 < T < , that the reserves are exhausted:

T
(6) R0 = [B(t)Lr(t)]dt. 0

The condition (6) holds because the marginal cost of extraction depends only on the rate of extraction, prices and technology. Thus if there are positive rents, reserves are exhausted.
Since T is chosen by the resource owners, it must be that the present value of profits from extracting the resource at time T equals the rental value of the reserves extracted at that moment.8 Given the Hotelling condition for intertemporal optimization (5) must hold over the entire interval of extraction, it must also hold at time T. Thus, at the moment when reserves are exhausted, the marginal and average costs of production are equated (Gray 1914):

(7)

pm[B(T)Lr(T)]1- 

=

pm[B(T)Lr(T)]1-.

This implies that Lr(T) = 0. To show that T is finite, plug into (5) the result that at T, Lr(T) = 0. Then (5) implies that pr - eT = 0. Since  = e-Tpr > 0, this can only occur if T is finite.
Differentiating the intertemporal equilibrium condition (5) with respect to time and using (5) to eliminate  yields an expression for how Lr(t) evolves over time:

(8)

L r(t) Lr(t)

=

-prLr(t)-1e-(1-)gt (1-)pm

- g(1 - 1-

).

Equation (8) is a non-linear differential equation that can be solved by the Bernoulli substitution, v(t) = Lr(t)1- (e.g., Sato 1963). This allows (8) to be expressed as a linear differential equation in

8 Expressing the problem of the mine owner of maximizing (3) subject to (2) as a Hamiltonian, H(Lr, R, , t) = e-T[pr(BLr) - wBLr] - (BLr), then the necessary condition when T is freely chosen is that H(Lr, R, , T) = 0. Using this condition and (5) to solve for  yields (7).

=

(1 - )LL rr((tt)) =  - g(1 - ) - vp(rte)-p(m1-)gt.

Given the boundary condition from (7) that v(T) = Lr(T)1- = 0, the solution to (9) is

(10)

Lr(t)1- = v(t) = pmpr(1 - e-(T - t))e-(1-)gt.

From (10), the percentage change in the quantity of labor used in the resource sector declines according to

0.

Notice that as tT, L r(t)/Lr(t) the rate at which labor leaves the resource sector accelerates. Thus we can state the following result:

Lemma 1 (Hotelling): In order for economic rents to be rising at the rate of interest, the quantity of labor used in the resource sector is decreasing over time, approaching zero as tT.

This implies that the quantity of labor used in manufacturing must be increasing over time.

Thus a resource economy is always on the path to becoming a manufacturing economy. How far

down that path it is depends upon the countries' resource endowment (which determines T) and

how long it has been exploiting that resource (which determines T - t). Note also that the amount

of labor employed in the resource sector is increasing in pr, , and , and decreasing in pm and .

At a any point in time t, 0 < t < T, equation (5) may be rewritten as

(12)

(pr - et)Lr-1e(1-)gt = pm,

where we have divided through by egt on each side of the equation. Since the right-hand-side of

10

(12) is a constant, the time derivative of the left-hand-side must be zero. From (8) we know that Lr is decreasing over time. As a decrease in Lr causes the left-hand-side of (9) to increase, it must be that the expression (pr - et)Lr-1e(1-)gt is shifting down over time. In order to satisfy (6) and (7), it must be that  = pre-T. Thus, at time T, pr = eT, and Lr(T) = 0. This equilibrium is depicted in Figure 1. The value of the marginal product of labor in the resource sector, net of rents, is the downward sloping function labeled (pr - et)(BLr)/B. Thus, the value of marginal product of labor in the resource sector, net of rents, is shifting down over time as rents are rising in current value. The opportunity cost of labor is given by pm, which is constant over time. By time T, the resource rents have risen to the point where they equal pr, so Lr(T) is zero.

Notes--This graph plots the value of the marginal product in the manufacturing sector (pm) and the resource sector, (pr - et)(BLr). Over time the labor share in the resource sector declines. The shaded area is the reduction in rents earned in the resource sector at time t+t relative to the rents earned at time t. By time T, the rents vanish, and the economy becomes a pure manufacturing economy.
Next, we turn to finding an expression for the growth rate in per capita income in an

11

economy with natural resources. Differentiating (4) with respect to time and dividing each side by y, provides an expression for the percentage rate of change in per capita income in this economy:9

and

(t)

ymLLr.

Since (5) implies that yr - ym = (LrB)-1B > 0, (t) is the the per capita net resource rental value times the marginal product of labor in the resource sector divided by per capita income. Thus (t) is the per capita share of resource rents in income evaluated at the margin. The term (t) = (t) + ym/y is the ratio of the weighted gross marginal return in the resource and manufacturing sectors to total income, and is positive in sign. The numerator of the term (t) is yr - ym = pr(LrB)-1B - pmB, which is the average net return per unit of labor in the resource sector. Thus (t) is the share of resource rents in per capita income evaluated at the average resource rent. As  < 1, average resource rents, pr - AC, always exceed marginal resource rents, pr - MC.
The percentage rate of growth in per capita income is composed of three parts. The first expression on the right-hand-side of (12) is the share of marginal rents in income, , times the rate of change in the quantity of labor employed in the resource sector. This expression is negative, since labor is leaving the resource sector. The second expression is sum of the share of marginal rents in the resource sector in income plus the gross return in the manufacturing sector

9 See the Appendix for the derivation of equations (13) and (14).

12

times the rate at which these are increasing due to technological change. This term is positive in sign since both rents and technological change are positive. The third term is the rate at which the share of average resource rents in total income is being spread over a larger number of people. This term is negative in sign.
We are now in a position to state the following proposition regarding the "curse of natural resources":

Proposition 1: Ceteris paribus, an economy with active natural resource production grows more slowly than one that has no natural resources.

Proof: A pure manufacturing economy has a per capita growth rate equal to y m/ym = g. Subtracting (12) from this yields an expression for the difference in the percentage growth rates of a pure manufacturing economy and a mixed manufacturing-resource economy:

(15)

g(1 - )yyrLLr

0.

From (12), (14) and the assumption that 0 <  < 1, each of these terms is positive in sign, which completes the proof. Q.E.D.

Proposition 1 shows that the findings of Sachs and Warner (1995, 2001) can occur in a simple competitive two-sector model of an exhaustible resource economy. The intuition behind this result is that in a natural resource economy, the share of labor in the sector earning economic rents is declining, and the share of rents in the economy is being spread over a larger number of individuals as the number of effective workers grows. Externalities in production, economies of scale, corruption or inefficiency are not necessary to get this result. Thus, in our view, the search for an x that is crowded out is unnecessary--the dynamics of low growth arise because of the

13

dynamics of an exhaustible resource market. Next, we consider whether it follows that a slower growth rate in per capita income means
that resources are a curse for an economy? In particular, we consider how the per capita income level compares in an economy with a portion of its income derived from natural resources and one with its income generated entirely from manufacturing, holding all else constant. The main result is summarized in Proposition 2:
Proposition 2: Ceteris paribus, an economy with natural resources has higher per capita income than an economy without natural resources.
Proof: Per capita income in an economy with a mix of natural resource production and manufacturing is given by (4). If all income were generated from manufacturing, per capita income is ym. Subtracting ym from y yields
(16) y - ym = LLr(yr - ym) > 0.
The expression on the right-hand-side is positive in sign since the net value of the average product of labor in the resource sector is positive by (14). This completes the proof. Q.E.D.
Proposition 2 shows that while economies with natural resources grow slower than manufacturing economies, it does not follow that natural resources are a curse, since per capita income is higher for countries that have natural resource endowments, all else constant. Thus arguments over whether or not a nation should ignore its natural resource base are based on an incomplete view of welfare. Propositions 1 and 2 show that a nation with a large natural resource base will have high per capita incomes, but those incomes will not grow as quickly as a nation that has no natural resources.
An interesting comparison can be made with the growth equation in (13) and the growth
14

equation in Stiglitz (1974).10 In Stiglitz, output of the economy is given by the constant-returnsto-scale production function in capital (K), labor, and resource output (Q): (17) Y = K(LB)Q1--, where  and  are constants between zero and one. Time differentiating (17) yields

Let gR denote the growth rate in Q.11 Then using y = Y/L and k = K/L to denote per capita income and capital stock, along the balanced growth path, where y /y = k/k, this growth equation can be written as

We see that when gR is negative, as it is in (13), we obtain the curse of natural resources result that resources are a drag on economic growth. We also see that the remainder of (18) shares the properties with (13) that the other two factors affecting growth are g, the growth rate in technology, which has a positive effect, and n, the population growth rate, which has a negative effect. The difference between (18) and (13) is that in (18), the coefficients on g, n, and gR are all constants. However, in (13), these coefficients change over time. This is due to the sectoral shifts that occur in this model, which do not occur in the Stiglitz model. Nevertheless, (18) shows that the two models share a common structure.

10 We thank Scott Taylor, who pointed out this relationship to us. 11 In our model, gR = LL rr((tt)) + g, which is negative by (11), so the coefficient on g and gR change accordingly.
15

A second observation can be made for the case where the resource is exhausted. In the Stiglitz model, no resources will be used if the coefficient on R, 1 -  -  = 0. When this occurs, the growth rate in (18) collapses to y/y = g/(1-) = g, which is the growth rate in a Solow economy. As we showed above, a similar thing happens when the resource is exhausted. In that case, y /y = g. Thus, the model in (13) has as special cases, two familiar growth models from the literature.
Figure 2: Dynamics of Labor Allocation, Income, and Per Capita Income.
Notes--Panel (a) plots Lr (declining over time) Lm and total labor L; panel (b) plots income in a pure manufacturing economy (My, which is rising) and income in a mixed resource-manufacturing economy (Y, which declines then rises after it becomes a manufacturing economy); and panel (c) plots per capita income in a mixed-resource-manufacturing economy (y, which is falling until it becomes a manufacturing economy) and per capita income in a pure manufacturing economy (my, which is rising). Each graph is drawn with  = 0. 5,  = 0. 3, g = 0. 15, n = 0.1, pr = 1, pm = 3, T = 3, and L(0) = 0.05, and B(0) = 1.
Next, we plot the equilibrium for a particular set of parameters in Figure 2, which shows the dynamics of Lr, Lm, L, Y, Ym, y and ym over time. In panel (a), Lr is decreasing over time while both L and Lm are increasing. The resulting aggregate income is plotted in panel (b), along with the aggregate income of an economy in which there are no resources. Aggregate income in the resource economy is higher, but the resource curse means that the rate of growth in income is lower--indeed, it is negative for these parameters--than in a pure manufacturing economy.
16

Panel (c) shows the change over time in per capita incomes. These follow a similar pattern to the aggregate incomes in panel (b). The resource curse means that a mixed resource-manufacturing economy has a higher level of per capita income, but a lower growth rate in per capita income.

The negative relationship between growth rates and reserve abundance is apparent in this measure of natural resource intensity as it was in the measures used by Sachs and Warner (1995, 2001). The simple correlation in the data is -0.33. This correlation is apparently not due to poor governance, as among the OECD countries, the correlation is -0.58.

Figure 4, we do not see a negative relationship between reserve abundance and per capita income levels. While the simple correlation is -0.06 in the whole sample, among the countries at the top of the income levels in 1996, such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, Japan, and the Netherlands, we see a positive relationship exists between income and oil reserves. It is only for countries like Nigeria, Benin, and Syria that high oil reserves are associated with very low incomes. These are countries where the governance has been the poorest over the past thirty years. Thus in the next section, we turn to an analysis of institutional quality.

4. The Impact of Poor Institutional Quality
A number of authors have tied the disappointing growth experiences of resource rich countries to poor institutions. (e.g., Atkinson and Hamilton 2003, Torvik 2002, Sala-i-Martin and
18

Subramanian 2003, and Bulte, Damania, and Deacon 2003). In this section, we show that one particularly simple form of bad policies--i.e., those that threaten to confiscate resource wealth-- do in fact have a negative effect on growth, but that such an effect is, once again, predicated in the dynamics of a resource economy.
Suppose the government, or individuals using the government, threatens to confiscate the wealth in the resource sector. This can occur through a "windfall profits" tax, nationalization, or any other mechanism that threatens to reduce the returns to owners of the resource. In particular, we shall focus on the most drastic form that this may take, which is direct confiscation as occurred in Venezuela and more recently with the Russian government's take over of Yukos. Let F(t) = 1 - e-t denote the constant and exogenous probability that the resource is confiscated by the government by time t. Thus, the instantaneous probability of wealth being confiscated over a small interval t is t. If confiscated, the current owners of the resource earn zero income from that point on (although the new owners may earn positive rents). This changes the optimization problem faced by producers in the resource sector in the following manner. Now, the resource sector maximizes
TT (19) PV = e-t[pr(BLr) - wBLr][1 - F(t)]dt = e-(+)t[pr(BLr) - wBLr]dt,
00
subject to the constraint (3). However, the solution to this problem is identical to the solution to (2), except that the discount rate has increased to  +  from . We can now state the following:
Proposition 3: When there is an instantaneous probability dt of expropriation of the resource, the equilibrium path yields a more rapid natural resource exploitation rate than when  = 0.
Proof: See the Appendix.
19

Proposition 3 shows that poor institutional quality of the form of probabilistic expropriation has the effect that it increases the rate at which labor in the resource sector is declining. This occurs because the value of the resource, , decreases when there is a chance that it may be expropriated, so owners protect themselves by extracting the resource more quickly. Thus, there is both a negative level and a negative growth effect of insecure property rights. The important point to note, however, is that while poor institutional quality lowers per capita income relative to the benchmark of "best institutional arrangements", in the most extreme situation where poor institutions dissipate all resource rents, the level of per capita GDP will not fall below its nonresource sector income. Poor institutional quality may be important for explaining the poor productivity of the non-resource sector. Consistent with the views of Olson Jr. (1996), poor but resource abundant countries lack the necessary institutions to develop with or without natural resources.
5. "Dutch Disease" Effects of Resource Booms on Growth
Trade economists such as Neary and Van Wijnbergen (1986) and Sachs and Warner (2001) invoke the Dutch Disease argument to explain why natural resource intensive economies perform badly. In the simplest Dutch disease model, there are three sectors of the economy, a resource sector, which acts purely as an export sector, a non-traded sector (e.g., services), and a traded sector (e.g., manufacturing). Let Lr and Ln denote the number of workers in the resource and nontraded sectors, and Lm = L - Lr - Ln the number of workers in the traded manufacturing sector. For simplicity, we shall ignore technological change, so g = 0. Let k(Ln)  Ln, where 0 <  < 1, is the output in the non-traded sector, and let pn denote the endogenous price in the non-traded sector. Per capita income in this model is
20

(20)

y

=

prLr

+

pnLn

+

pm(L L

-

Ln).

Since we assume that the resource sector is purely for export, a representative domestic consumer purchases only manufacturing and non-traded goods. Thus a representative domestic consumer faces the following budget constraint:

(21)

prLr + pnLn + pm(L - Lr - Ln) L

=

pnqn

+ L

pmqm,

where qn/L and qm/L are consumption per effective unit of labor in non-traded and manufacturing goods. Total production in the non-traded sector equals total demand:

(22) pnLn = pnqn.
In addition, assuming that the manufacturing sector still has positive production, competition for labor implies that the non-traded sector faces a wage w = pm, so the quantity of labor used in the non-traded sector satisfies

(23) pnLn-1 = pm.

Similarly, in the traded resource sector the equilibrium wage is also w = pm. Writing the firstorder condition for the resource sector in current value terms yields:

(24) prLr-1 - pm = Lr-1et.
In addition, utility maximization implies a relationship between qn and qm. Letting U(qn, qm) = qnqm1-/L denote the Cobb-Douglas utility function of a representative consumer, we obtain that the marginal rate of substitution be equal to the price ratio, which implies

(25) pnqn = (1-)pmqm.

21

Equations (20)-(25) describe the equilibrium in a Dutch disease economy at any point in time, t  T. The endogenous variables are Lr, Ln, qn, qm, and pn.12
From (24), we obtain the condition given by (12) for the percentage change in the labor used in the resource sector. Differentiating (22) with respect to time and dividing by levels yields

(26)

q n(t) qn(t)

= LL nn((tt)).

Thus, the rate of change of consumption of the non-traded good is a fraction () of the rate of change of the labor employed in the non-traded sector. From (23), the price in the non-traded sector also changes at a rate proportional to the rate of change in the labor employed in the nontraded sector:

(27)

p n(t) pn(t)

=

(1 - )LL nn((tt)).

Thus the percentage rate of change in pn is a fraction (1-) of the rate of change of labor employed in the non-traded sector.
From (25), we can see that percentage change in the aggregate quantity of manufacturing goods consumed also moves at the same rate as the percentage change of the amount of labor utilized in the non-traded goods sector:

(28)

q m(t) qm(t)

= qq nn((tt))

+ (1 - )pp nn((tt))

=

LL nn((tt)).

The percentage rate of change in income per unit of effective labor in this model is

12 The shadow price of the resource, , and the length of time it takes to exhaust the resource are also endogenous. The extra equations needed to solve for these values are the end-point condition that L^ r(T) = 0, given by (7) above, and the condition that reserves are exhausted, given by (6).

The properties of the i and i are identical to the properties of  and  above, with y given by (20) rather than by (4). To close this system, we need to obtain an expression for how Ln changes over time. This is obtained from budget constraint, which equates income to expenditures for the representative consumer:

=

where the second equality makes use of (26)-(28). Rearranging this yields an expression for L n(t)/Ln(t) as a function of L r(t)/Lr(t) and n:

(32)

L n(t) Ln(t)

= 1 -r(tn)(t)LL rr((tt))

+ 1 - 1 r-(t) n-(t) n(t)n.

Substituting (32) into (29) yields an expression for the percentage growth rate of income per capita as a function of L r(t)/Lr(t) and n:

y (t) y(t)

=

1 -r(tn)(t)LL rr((tt))

23

The right-hand-side of (33) is negative since n > n, and no technological change occurs. Thus, we may state the following proposition: Proposition 4: In a "Dutch Disease" model with a non-traded sector and consumption of only the traded manufacturing and the non-traded good, the per capita growth rate in an economy with natural resources is lower than that of an economy without natural resources. Proof: See the Appendix. Thus, even in a Dutch disease model, we see that the basic result regarding growth rates is driven by the fact that labor is shifting out of the resource sector over time as the resource sector obeys Hotelling's rule.
We may also prove an analog to Proposition 2 regarding level effects:13 Proposition 5: The level of per capita income increases when the economy becomes more resource intensive, all else constant. Proof: See the Appendix.
This proposition shows that even in a simple Dutch disease model, having natural resources increases the level of per capita income, holding all else constant. Thus, the results of section 2 follow through even when there are Dutch disease effects.
6. Issues in Testing Hypotheses for the Curse of Natural Resources
If our model provides the correct explanation for the resource curse, then it should be the case that over the long run measures of initial resource abundance are negatively correlated with growth rates, but positively correlated or uncorrelated with per capita income levels. Crowding out explanations such as those identified by Sachs and Warner (2001) would be supported by a
13 The methodology of this proof could also be used to prove Proposition 2.
24

negative correlation between per capita incomes and measures of resource abundance.

The standard approach for estimating the effect of natural resource abundance on growth

involves using a single equation growth models to capture both a level and a growth effect.

Consider the conditional convergence estimating equation used by Sachs and Warner (2001):

(34)

1 N

lnyyN0ii 

=

0 + 1 ln(y0i) + 2 R0i + 3Zi + i,

where yN and y0i are per capita incomes measured at times N periods apart, R0i is a measure of

resource abundance at time 0, Zi is a set of other control variables, and i is the unobserved error.

The parameters in this model are the j, j = 1,..,4. If we rearrange this equation to look at level effects, we obtain:

(35) ln(yNi ) = 0N + (1N + 1)ln(y0i) + 2NR0i + 3NZi + Ni.
Thus, the signs of all of the coefficients in the level effects regression except the coefficient on the initial per capita income will be the same sign in the growth equation and the level equation. All that changes across these equations is the magnitudes of the coefficients on the variables other than the initial income level. The magnitudes of the coefficients in the level equation are N higher than those in the growth equations. Thus, it is not possible to identify separate level and growth effects using this model if estimated by ordinary least squares.
Our model suggests one way to think about this problem. An implication from the propositions regarding level effects is that both the initial per capita income, y0i, and the ending per capita income, yNi , will be higher in resource economies. This suggests that resource abundance affects both the initial per capita income, y0i, as well as future per capita income, yNi . Thus one procedure that might account for this is to treat the initial income as a function of the measure of resource abundance. However, this requires finding instruments that are correlated

25

with the initial income but not with end of period income. Given the difficulties of such a task, we leave this to future research.
7. Discussion and Conclusions.
A number of economists have sought to explain the "curse of natural resources." We show that when one considers a simple Hotelling exhaustible resource model, the explanation of the curse of natural resources is immediately clear. Well functioning natural resource markets require that the marginal profit be equalized across time. In a simple model with one variable input, this means that the quantity of that input used in production declines over time, as does the production of that resource. This fact alone makes it possible to observe the growth of per capita income in resource abundant economies will be lower than in resource scarce economies. No reference to "Dutch disease" problems or induced rent-seeking from natural resources are required to obtain this result. Of course, these factors can play a role, but the fundamental driver is and always will be the basic economics of intertemporal use of a natural resource.
To call it a "curse" to have a natural resource endowment is to ignore the fact that an economy with abundant natural resources has a higher level of per capita income than an economy that does not have abundant resources, or in one that chooses not to exploit its resources. The reason is simply that an economy with a natural resource base has the potential to earn economic rents from this resource. Since those rents are not available to an economy without the resource, an economy with the resource is richer. Indeed for this not to be the case, the rent-seeking must be fundamentally irrational, since the rents being sought are more than consumed.
The model presented here can be extended in a number of ways, each maintaining the basic story that natural resources are bad for growth but are good for having higher incomes. One
26

simple extension is to allow the price of the natural resource to be affected by the quantity supplied by that country (e.g., Saudi Arabia for oil or South Africa for diamonds). In this case, the Hotelling model predicts again that marginal profits must be rising over time, which implies that the output (and hence labor input) is declining over time. Another extension that is possible is to allow the production of the resource to depend upon the resource stock, e.g., to specify the production function as (Lr,R), where R > 0. In this case, the basic results of the Hotelling model still hold. The only difference is in the conditions that hold at time T, when the resource is exhausted.
One interesting extension to our model would look at how resource intensive economies invest their wealth. An economy that invests its wealth in international capital markets, earning a rate of return  on these investments, could have a much different consumption path than the economies considered here and in Rodriguez and Sachs (1999). The consumption path of a country availing itself to the international capital markets could have a consumption path that is either declining or rising, depending upon whether or not r, the countries' own discount rate, is greater or less than the international return on capital, . Future research in this area should look at a model where consumption can be smoothed by savings on the international markets. Such a model would predict that GNP measures would be much smoother than GDP measures, since a country that can save in this fashion would alter its consumption pattern relative to its income pattern.
Finally, it is interesting to note that tests of the Hotelling model have proved to have mixed results. Miller and Upton (1985) found support for the Hotelling model, while Halvorson and Smith (1991) did not. We are suggesting that evidence for the Hotelling model shows up in aggregate macroeconomic statistics, and that this is the explanation for the curse of natural
27

resources. A direct test of this hypothesis would require looking at how resource revenues change over time. This is not what the present empirical literature on the curse of natural resources has estimated. Thus, the model we present suggests future empirical work on the curse of natural resource focus more specifically on how the resource sector evolves in modern economies.

Proof of Proposition 3: Let Lr|(t) denote the amount of labor used in the resource sector when the

discount rate is , and let Lr|+(t) denote the amount of labor used when there is a chance that the resource will be expropriated. Since each path must satisfy (6), there exists a point in time, t*, such that the two

paths intersect. Thus, at t*, Lr|(t*) = Lr|+(t*). From (10), this implies

(A.4) Lr|(t*)1-  pmpr(1 - e-(T - t*))e-(1-)gt* = pmpr(1 - e-(+)(T+ - t*))e-(1-)gt*  Lr|+(t*)1-,

where T denotes the time at which Lr| = 0 and T+ denotes the time at which Lr|+ = 0. Canceling common terms and taking logarithms on each side of the equation yields

Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 5: The equilibrium in a resource economy is given by (26)-(30). Given exogenous prices in manufacturing and the resource sector, the dynamics of labor demand in the resource sector are given by (25). Letting (22)-(24) and (26) describe the remaining endogenous variables, a change in the size of the resource sector has the following effect on the per capita income in the economy:

The last term on the right-hand-side is equal to zero by (28). Thus, the level effect of an increase in labor

used in the resource sector is felt directly through the rents per worker earned in the resource sector and

indirectly through the effect this has on the price in the non-traded sector. To get this effect, differentiate

the system (22)-(24) and (26) with respect to Lr:

(A.12)

Letting H denote the Jacobian matrix on the left-hand-side of (A.7), it follows that

(A.13)

|H| = pmpnLn-2[Ln + (1 - )qn] > 0,

and

(A.14)

pn Lr

pmpnLn-2(prLr-1 - pm)(1 - )(1 - )|H|-1

Thus the right-hand-side of (A.11) is positive. Q.E.D.
