NASAL T/NATURAL KILLER (NK)-CELL LYMPHOMAS ARE DERIVED FROM EPSTEIN-BARR VIRUS­INFECTED CYTOTOXIC LYMPHOCYTES OF BOTH NK- AND T-CELL LINEAGE

The cellular nature of nasal T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphomas (NLs) remains controversial. It is still debatable whether these represent T-cell lymphomas with extensive loss of surface antigens or are, in fact, true NK-cell lymphomas. They are associated closely with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), to the extent that EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs (EBER) expression can be used as a marker for the neoplastic cells. The cell lineage of this group of lymphomas was examined further by correlating immunophenotype, genotype and EBV status with the expression of cytotoxic granule-associated proteins, perforin and T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) in 13 cases of NL. Combined immunophenotypic and gene rearrangement analyses demonstrated that NLs can be identified clearly as either NK-cell or T-cell tumours. Nasal NK-cell lymphomas lacked clonal rearrangement of both T-cell receptor (TCR)  and immunogloulin heavy chain (IgH) genes and were either CD3(Leu4)CD56 (8 cases) or CD3(Leu4)CD56 (2 cases), whereas nasal T-cell lymphomas had rearranged TCR and germ-line IgH genes and were either CD3(Leu4)CD56 (2 cases) or CD3(Leu4)CD56 (1 case). Immunohistochemical (IH) studies showed that both perforin and TIA-1 were expressed universally in NL, irrespective of NK- or T-cell lineage. Dual labelling of TIA-1 by IH and EBER by in situ hybridisation demonstrated that the granule proteins were expressed predominantly by the EBER tumour cells. Our results indicate that NLs are derived from EBV-infected cytotoxic lymphocytes of both NK- and T-cell lineage. We postulate that cytotoxic lymphocytes generated during the cellular immune response to EBV infection or re-activation at the nasal region themselves may become targets for EBV infection and subsequent transformation.

Although nasal T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma (NL) has
been considered a subset of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (Chan et
al., 1987) owing to expression of some T cell­related antigens, the
majority have been shown to carry germ-line T-cell receptor (TCR)
and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes (Ho et al., 1990b) while expressing
an NK cell­associated antigen, CD56 (Ho et al., 1990a), thus
raising doubts as to the true nature of this neoplasm. Part of the
confusion arises because T and NK cells share common surface
antigens. While CD3 was thought to be a specific antigen for T cells, the cytoplasmic CD3 chain is expressed by activated adult NK cells and cytoplasmic CD3 ,  and  complexes are expressed by fetal NK cells (Lanier et al., 1992). Similarly, CD56 is
expressed on all NK cells and a subset of T cells (Lanier et al.,
1986). Further studies, however, revealed that NL may consist of
both NK- and T-cell tumours, which are morphologically indistin-
guishable but different in TCR gene rearrangement and transcript
expression (Chiang et al., 1996a). Nasal NK-cell tumours carry germ-line TCR and Ig genes and express truncated 1.0 kb TCR and multiple unrearranged TCR mRNAs, whereas nasal T-cell tumours have unrearranged TCR or  genes and express full-length TCR transcripts (Chiang et al., 1996a). Both subtypes are closely
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and express the same
EBV latent genes (Chiang et al., 1996b). On the contrary, B-cell
tumors of the nasal region are mostly secondary tumours, exist
almost exclusively in the nasopharynx and have a much less
frequent association with EBV (data not shown).

While we have provided phenotypic and genotypic evidence to support NK-cell lineage for the majority of NLs, demonstration of cytotoxic activity of the tumour cells, which is a hallmark of cytolytic cells, would provide additional evidence for NK-cell lineage. Perforin and T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) are cytotoxic granule-associated proteins which are expressed constitutively in NK cells and up-regulated in activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Liu et al., 1995; Anderson et al., 1990). Perforin is a pore-forming protein that inserts into target cell membranes, which may facilitate the entry of other granule proteins, such as granzymes and TIA-1, into the target cells (Liu et al., 1995). It is a key effector molecule in T- and NK-cell cytolysis, as was demonstrated in perforin-deficient mice (Kagi et al., 1994). TIA-1, however, is an RNA-binding protein capable of inducing DNA fragmentation in permeabilised thymocytes (Tian et al., 1991). Both have been shown to be reliable markers for activated cytotoxic lymphocytes in vivo (Griffiths and Mueller, 1991; Anderson, 1995). Here, we describe the pattern of expression of perforin and TIA-1 in a series of NLs, correlating the results with the phenotype, genotype and EBV status of the tumours. In addition, dual-labelling studies of TIA-1 and EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs (EBER) were used to determine the distribution of these granule proteins in relation to the tumour cell population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Case selection
Thirteen cases of NL with sufficient fixed and frozen tissues available for the studies described were selected from the files of the Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, covering a 9 year period (1986­1994). Cases 1­12 are identical to the first 12 cases and case 13 is equivalent to case 18 of another report from our group (Chiang et al., 1996b). All were primary tumours except cases 5 and 6, which were recurrences at the primary nasal site after complete remissions, and case 13, which was a metastatic lesion to the testis from a primary nasal lymphoma. Histological classification of the tumours is described in Table I. For TIA-1 staining, 8 cases of primary nasal or nasopharyngeal B-cell lymphomas from the same study period were included for comparison.
Immunophenotyping Immunophenotyping with a panel of monoclonal antibodies
(MAbs) against B, T and NK cells (Table I) was carried out as

described previously (Chiang et al., 1996a). Polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3 antibody (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) was applied on paraffin-embedded tissue sections (3 µm) after antigen retrieval by heating in a pressure cooker for 2 min using the streptavidin­ biotin complex (SABC) method and diaminobenzidine as substrate.
TCR and Ig gene rearrangement studies
Rearrangement of TCR and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH ) genes was analysed by PCR. DNA was extracted from representative frozen tissues of each case by standard methods (Chiang et al., 1996a) except for cases 3 and 12, where DNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues was used. Two independent protocols verified by different groups were employed for TCR gene analysis. Protocol I consisted of a single PCR reaction (labelled TCRG1) using 1 pair of consensus primers of the V and J gene segments (Benhattar et al., 1995), whereas protocol II consisted of 2 separate PCR reactions (labelled TCRG2 and TCRG3) using an equal mixture of 2 V consensus primers in combination with one of 2 J primers complementary to a common sequence in the J1/J2 and JP1/JP2 gene segments of the TCR gene, respectively (McCarthy et al., 1992). For IgH gene analysis, one pair of consensus primers of the VH and JH gene segments was employed (McCarthy et al., 1990). DNA (0.5 µg) was amplified in a 50 µl PCR reaction volume for 40 cycles with magnesium concentration and annealing temperature optimised for individual PCR reactions. Amplified products were electrophoresed through an 8% polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. Molt-4 or Peer cell lines (T-cell leukemia lines) and Nalm-6 (B-cell lymphoma line) served as positive controls for TCR and IgH PCR, respectively, with H2O as negative control.
Although TCR gene rearrangement is not lineage-specific when interpreted on its own, our data combining phenotype with TCR as well as IgH status would exclude any B-cell or non-lymphoid tumours. The advantages of TCR PCR analysis are the relatively small number of V and J genes which enable a simple primer design (McCarthy et al., 1992) and the more frequent rearrangement of the TCR over the TCR locus in T-cell lymphomas of either  or  lineage (Theodorou et al., 1994).
To validate the PCR-based gene rearrangement assays, 19 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphomas with rearranged TCR genes and 15 cases of B-cell lymphomas with rearranged IgH genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridisation in our laboratory, were

evaluated by the above PCR protocols. For TCR gene analysis, protocols I and II were found to be complementary with rearrangement detected in 16/19 (84%) T-cell lymphomas, and for IgH, rearrangement was detected in 11/15 (73%) B-cell lymphomas.
Immunohistochemical (IH) staining for perforin and TIA-1
For perforin, cryostat sections (6 µm) were stained by the alkaline phosphatase-labelled streptavidin­biotin method, using MAb, clone delta G9 (T Cell Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA) at a dilution of 1:10 and new fuchsin as a substrate. For TIA-1, the SABC method was applied on paraffin-embedded sections (3 µm), using MAb, clone 2G9 (Anderson et al., 1990), at a dilution of 1:1,000 and diaminobenzedine as a substrate. No antigen retrieval was required. Irrelevant antibodies of the same isotype, mouse IgG2b and IgG1 (Dako, Kyoto, Japan), were used as negative controls for perforin and TIA-1 staining, respectively. TIA-1 cells were recorded as a percentage of total nucleated cells in each case; at least 1,000 nucleated cells were counted per case.
In situ hybridisation (ISH) for EBER
Results of EBER ISH on the 13 NLs have been reported (Chiang et al., 1996b), showing positive EBER signals in the majority of tumour cells in every case. Adjacent sections were used for TIA-1 IH and EBER ISH. The percentage of EBER cells was scored similarly in each case as in TIA-1-stained sections.
Dual-labelling study for TIA-1 and EBER
Dual-labelling of paraffin-embedded sections (3 µm) by combining TIA-1 IH and EBER ISH was performed. TIA-1 staining was applied first by the alkaline phosphatase­labelled streptavidin­ biotin method using new fuchsin as a substrate, followed by EBER ISH.
RESULTS
Determination of lineage
Nasal NK-cell lymphomas were distinguished from nasal T-cell lymphomas primarily by the absence of TCR gene rearrangement. Ten NK-cell and 3 T-cell lymphomas were identified (Table I). Histological characteristics were shown in Figure 1.
Nasal NK-cell lymphomas. No rearranged bands were detected in either TCR or IgH PCR. A broad smear derived from polyclonal reactive T lymphocytes was detected by the TCR PCR in most cases (Fig. 2). Germ-line TCR and IgH genes have been demon-

FIGURE 1 ­ Haematoxylin and eosin­stained paraffin sections of (a) nasal NK-cell (case 1) and (b) nasal T-cell (case 9) lymphomas demonstrate
that nasal NK- and T-cell lymphomas are morphologically indistinguishable, both consisting of an atypical lymphoid infiltrate of medium to
large-sized cells with round as well as elongated and irregularly shaped nuclei. A small number of reactive small lymphocytes, histiocytes and occasional plasma cells are found scattered amongst the atypical lymphoid cells. The majority of nasal NK-cell lymphomas are CD3(Leu4) (c, case 1), but some cases can be Leu4 (d, case 11), while nasal T-cell lymphomas are uniformly Leu4 (e, case 9). All pictures are at the same

strated previously by Southern blot analysis in cases 1 and 13
(Chiang et al., 1996a), in agreement with the PCR results.
Two phenotypic groups were identified (Table I). The majority (8 of 10 cases) were CD3(Leu4)CD56, while 2 cases (5 and 11) were CD3(Leu4)CD56 (Fig. 1). The Leu4CD56 lymphomas showed strong uniform expression of CD56. The 2 Leu4CD56
lymphomas differed, however, in their pattern of staining, with
intense uniform Leu4 but variable CD56 staining in case 5 in
contrast to weaker and heterogeneous Leu4 but uniformly strong
CD56 staining in case 11. The significance of this differential
staining of Leu4 and CD56 is not known. All cases were negative for CD5, CD4, F1 and TCR1. CD8 was expressed strongly in 2 cases (5 and 13), whereas CD7 was expressed variably in some cases (Table I). In contrast to our earlier report on the lack of CD3 staining in 2 cases of NL (Tao et al., 1995a), all of the Leu4CD56 nasal NK-cell lymphomas in this series were CD3, which is in agreement with results from other studies (Suzumiya et al., 1994; Emile et al., 1996). The discrepancy in our data could be due to an

improved antigen retrieval method in the application of the polyclonal anti-CD3 antibody on paraffin sections by heating in a pressure cooker rather than a microwave oven in the present study.
Nasal T-cell lymphomas. TCR PCR demonstrated mono-allelic rearrangement of the TCR gene in 2 cases (2 and 12) and bi-allelic rearrangement in 1 case (9) with no rearranged bands detected in IgH PCR, thereby confirming their T-cell lineage (Fig. 2). Clonal rearrangement of both TCR and TCR genes in case 2 has been confirmed by Southern blot analysis in a previous report (Chiang et al., 1996a).
Two phenotypic categories were recognised (Table I): 2 of 3 cases (2 and 12) were CD3(Leu4)CD56 and 1 case (9) was CD3(Leu4)CD56. All 3 cases showed strong uniform staining for CD3(Leu4) (Fig. 1) and polyclonal CD3, while CD56 staining was found to be more heterogeneous and only in a proportion of the atypical cells. For the other T-cell antigens, CD4 or CD8 always was expressed, with case 9 being double CD4CD8. CD5 was

expressed in 2 cases and F1 in 1 case, while TCR1 and CD7 were not expressed in any case (Table I).
Perforin and TIA-1 expression
Both perforin and TIA-1 were expressed abundantly in all NLs, irrespective of NK- or T-cell lineage. Perforin staining on cryostat sections was more membranous (Fig. 3), though granular appearance also was observed in some cases. TIA-1 staining on paraffin sections, however, demonstrated coarse granules in a perinuclear distribution and polarised to one end of the positive cells (Fig. 3). In contrast, TIA-1 staining was absent in all nasal B-cell lymphomas, except in some of the infiltrating lymphocytes.
Correlation between TIA-1 and EBER cell populations Close correlation was observed between percentages of TIA-1
and of EBER cells in each case of NL (Table II). A typical case consisted of around 50­70% TIA-1 cells, which corresponded to our previous estimate of the tumour cell proportion (Tao et al., 1995b). TIA-1 cells frequently outnumbered EBER cells in the same tumour, which could be explained by the presence of infiltrating cytotoxic T cells in the tumour tissues.
Co-localisation of TIA-1 and EBER
To ascertain whether these granule proteins were localised to the tumour population, dual-labelling of TIA-1 by IH and EBER by ISH was performed. Since virtually all tumour cells in NL expressed EBER in their nuclei (Tao et al., 1995b; Chiang et al., 1996b), EBER can serve as a tumour cell marker. The results showed that the 2 signals predominantly co-localised in the same cells in every case (Fig. 3). TIA-1EBER cells also were observed, particularly in those tumours where TIA-1 cells outnumbered EBER cells (Table II), and occasionally TIA-1EBER cells were noted in some cases, most likely representing reactive CTLs and EBV-reactive lymphocytes, respectively.
DISCUSSION
We have extended and confirmed our observation that NLs can be derived from both NK- and T-cell lineage (Chiang et al., 1996a) by combined immunophenotypic and genotypic studies, and we

further demonstrated that cytotoxic granule­associated proteins,
perforin and TIA-1, were expressed universally, irrespective of
NK- or T-cell lineage, in this group of lymphomas. In contrast,
these proteins were never expressed by B-cell tumours at the same
anatomic location. The granule proteins were shown to be localised
in the neoplastic cells by dual-labelling of TIA-1 and EBER using
EBER as a tumour cell marker. Therefore, we can conclude that
NLs represent malignant proliferations of EBV-infected cytotoxic
lymphocytes of both NK- and T-cell lineage.
Phenotypic and genotypic data revealed that NLs can be classified into 4 groups: TCRCD3(Leu4)CD56, TCRCD3(Leu4)CD56, TCRCD3(Leu4)CD56 and TCRCD3(Leu4)CD56. The first 2 represent phenotypic subtypes of nasal NK-cell lymphomas while the latter 2 represent those
of nasal T-cell lymphomas. The majority of NLs still fall into the first group of Leu4CD56 NK-cell tumours with germ-line TCR
genes, irrespective of geographic and ethnic variation (Weiss et al.,
1988; Ho et al., 1990b; Emile et al., 1996; Petrella et al., 1996;
present study). However, studies by 2 Japanese groups (Suzumiya
et al., 1994; Harabuchi et al., 1996) have shown some notable
differences. Both groups reported a similar predominance of Leu4CD56 NL cases (6/9 and 7/11 cases, respectively). All except one Leu4CD56 NL in the series of Suzumiya et al.
carried germ-line TCR genes and were, therefore, NK-cell lympho-
mas. Harabuchi et al. (1996) contested that 9 of 11 cases in their series were derived from NK-like T cells or  T cells based on demonstration of rearrangement of TCR,  or  genes together with expression of TCR, but not TCR, proteins. Two critical contradictions in their data, however, require closer scrutiny: (i) they failed to show concomitant rearrangement of both TCR and TCR genes in any case, yet 2 cases had both TCR and TCR, but not TCR genes rearranged and (ii) TCR protein was expressed in 4 cases in the absence of rearrangement of the TCR gene. Using the same antibodies, F1 and TCR1, we confirmed that TCR and  protein expression was absent in all nasal NK-cell lymphomas, irrespective of Leu4 positivity. For the nasal T-cell lymphomas, none expressed TCR protein, while only 1 of 3 cases expressed TCR protein, which is consistent with the frequent loss of this antigen among T-cell lymphomas (Picker et al., 1987).

together, our results have proved that NL is comprised of bona fide NK-cell tumours together with a smaller number of true T-cell lymphomas.
It is clear that gene rearrangement studies should be performed to distinguish nasal NK- from T-cell tumours in selected cases owing to the possibility of expression of both CD3 and CD56 antigens in either lineage. This observation is illustrated by the Leu4CD56 NLs in our series, in which 2 cases (2 and 12) showed clonal TCR gene rearrangement, while the remaining 2 cases (5 and 11) showed absence of TCR gene rearrangement, corresponding to T- and NK-cell lymphomas, respectively. An explanation for Leu4 positivity in nasal NK-cell lymphomas has been provided by Suzumiya et al. (1994), who suggested that these tumours may correspond to fetal NK cells, which express cytoplasmic CD3,  and  complexes. However, the Leu4 NK-cell lymphomas correspond to the phenotype of activated adult NK cells, which express the CD3 protein alone. This hypothesis is substantiated by the positive reaction of the tumour cells to polyclonal anti-CD3 antibody in the Leu4 NK-cell lymphomas. The discordance between Leu4 and polyclonal anti-CD3 reactivity is explained by the recognition of CD3 and CD3 complexes by Leu4 in contrast to specific detection of CD3 chain by the latter antibody (Suzumiya et al., 1994).
One key characteristic of NK cells and CTLs is their cytotoxic capability, at least part of which is mediated by the release of cytotoxic granule proteins into target cells. Direct evidence of cytotoxic activity of fresh tumour cells against the prototype NK-sensitive target cell line, K562, from a single case of nasal NK-cell lymphoma was demonstrated (Kaneko et al., 1995), and perforin was expressed in 8 cases of NL from Japan (Mori et al., 1996). Although gene rearrangement studies were not carried out in the latter report, the majority of cases appeared to be Leu4CD56 nasal NK-cell lymphomas. One of the most intriguing findings of our study is the demonstration of cytotoxic protein expression in all nasal T- as well as NK-cell lymphomas. Examination of CD4 and CD8 status in the nasal T-cell lymphomas revealed that they were single CD8 (case 2), single CD4 (case 12) and double CD4CD8 (case 9), corresponding to both CD8 and CD4 CTLs.

prevalence of the cytotoxic phenotype of nasal T-cell lymphomas is in contrast to the generally low prevalence of this phenotype, as illustrated by granzyme B expression, in peripheral T-cell lymphomas at other anatomic sites (de Bruin et al., 1994). The universal expression of cytotoxic proteins in NL, irrespective of NK- or T-cell lineage, argues for a selection for transformation of cytotoxic lymphocytes in this anatomic region. One clue to this phenomenon was indicated by our previous observations that in our population both normal nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosal tissues frequently harboured EBV-infected B as well as T lymphocytes, which can act as reservoirs for EBV persistence and, thus, may provide a local setting for the emergence of EBV-associated tumours (Tao et al., 1995c, 1996). Since they are the primary effector cells in host immune surveillance against EBV, it is plausible that cytotoxic lymphocytes generated during the cellular immune response to primary EBV infection or subsequent re-activation at the nasal region themselves may become targets for EBV infection and subsequent transformation. Evidence for T cells as potential targets for EBV transformation in vivo has been provided by the demonstration of clonal proliferation of EBV-infected T cells in 3 Japanese patients with severe chronic active EBV infection (Imai et al., 1996).
