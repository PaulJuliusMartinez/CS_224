CHINA'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: HOW FAST HAS GDP GROWN; HOW BIG IS IT COMPARED WITH THE USA?*
By Angus Maddison and Harry X. Wu In the past two decades, China has been the world's fastest growing economy. In 1982, it overtook Germany as the world's third largest economy; in 1992, overtook Japan as the second biggest economy. In 2003 its GDP was about 73 per cent of that in the USA. It seems likely that it will overtake the USA, and become number one before 2020. The above estimates were made by converting China's GDP and that of the other countries in their national currencies, using a PPP (purchasing power parity) converter, rather than the exchange rate. As the Chinese currency is greatly undervalued, the difference between PPP and exchange rate conversion is unusually large. With exchange rate conversion, Chinese GDP appears to have been only 15 per cent of that in the USA in 2003. Very frequently, there is significant error in assessing China's comparative performance when such exchange rate comparisons are used. This happens in journalism, in political discourse and also amongst some economists who regard Japan as the second largest economy although it now has a GDP less than half the Chinese. In 2003, German GDP was about a quarter of that in China. Estimation of the PPP converter for China is described in Maddison (1998) Appendix C, pp. 153-154. It was derived from the China/US expenditure comparison for 1986 in Ren (1997), China's Economic Performance in International Perspective, OECD, Paris, p. 37. His estimates were updated to 1990 which is the benchmark year for all other countries in Maddison (1995, 2001, 2003 and www.ggdc.net/Maddison). Here the PPP estimate of China's GDP in 1990 has been raised from $2,109,400 to $2,123,852, as the estimated 1986-1990 change in GDP volume between these years has been adjusted very slightly upwards.
(I) Official Estimates of Chinese GDP Growth Here we are mainly concerned with a different problem: adjustment of the official Chinese estimates of GDP growth. These were initially based on the Soviet material product system (MPS) which greatly exaggerated growth performance. They are now based on the western SNA system; they still exaggerate growth, but to a much smaller degree. Until the late 1980s, China used the Soviet material product system of accounts which systematically overstated growth, and excluded a large part of service activity. There were also serious deficiencies in the basic reporting system. In the turbulence of the cultural revolution, the statistical office was abolished in 1968 and its staff disbursed. It was re-established in 1972, but most of the old personnel had disappeared and many old records had been destroyed. No new graduates with the requisite training had been produced in the years when the universities were closed. The statistical office published two measures of aggregate economic performance. The "total product of society" showed average annual growth rate in "comparable prices" of 7.9 per cent for 1952-78 (1988 Yearbook p. 28). It referred to aggregate gross output of five sectors and involved a good deal of double counting because each of the component sectors had significant inputs from the others. "Net material product" which the Chinese called "national income" showed 6 per cent growth for the same period at "comparable prices" (p. 42 of the 1988 Yearbook); this was better as it deducted most inputs except "non-material services".

In the early 1990s, these Soviet style measures were dropped in favour of

western concepts showing slower growth. The statistical office also stopped reporting

estimates for the Maoist period 1952-78; since 1995, the Yearbooks have only

published estimates for 1978 onwards. However, there was a joint retrospective

exercise by the statistical office and Hitotsubashi University in 1997 which provided

western type estimates for 1952-1995. This exercise showed a growth rate of GDP of

4.7 per cent a year for 1952-78. The Maddison-Wu revision shows a growth rate of

4.4 for this period. For 1978-2003 Maddison­Wu show growth of 7.85 per cent a year

compared with the official 9.6 per cent. Table 1 summarises the difference between

the revised Maddison-Wu estimates and those of the NBS.

The estimates of the statistical office for 1978 onwards are a great improvement on the earlier MPS system. They are made independently from the production and expenditure side, but the former are considered more reliable (see Xu and Ye, 2000, p. 12). They are based on the international standard SNA guidelines, but there is still scope for improvement. The national accounts department of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is of high quality, but relatively small. In 2000, there were only 26 staff members. Reports at the basic level reach NBS through several levels of aggregation in the administrative hierarchy. This transmission train provides opportunities for officials at different levels to adjust their reports to reflect favourably on their management. NBS makes crosschecks, but they are necessarily limited in scope. Xu and Ye give a detailed account of the procedures used in constructing official accounts. Except for two sectors (agriculture and transport), growth measures are not based on quantitative indicators of volume movement. Most sector accounts are constructed at current prices and deflated by price indices. Because of the shakiness of the price reports it receives, the NBS, until 2002, distinguished between current and "comparable" prices instead of current and "constant" prices as other countries do. State enterprises use a price manual specifying 2,000 items to help them differentiate current and constant prices. Many reporting units in the private sector cannot or do not make this distinction. This is an important reason for overstatement in the official statistics.
(II) Maddison-Wu Re-estimation of Chinese Growth, 1952-2003 Maddison (1998) re-estimated Chinese performance to produce a measure of growth and levels closer to western SNA practice. This required recalculation of the annual change in real GDP at 1987 prices from 1952 to 1995. Maddison (2001 and 2003) contained rough updates of the GDP growth estimate beyond 1995, using a "correction coefficient" derived by applying the ratio (.7586) of the Maddison estimates to the official growth rate for 1978-95 to correct the official figures beyond 1995. It is now clear that this type of updating is unsatisfactory, as the difference between the official and the Maddison estimates is not stable from year to year. In this

2

paper, Maddison and Wu have made comprehensive revisions and updates for 19522003 which supersede earlier Maddison estimates.
(1) Maddison (1998) made his own estimates of gross value added in farming, using price and quantity data of the Food and Agriculture Organisation for 125 crop and livestock items, adjusted for changes in farm and non-farm inputs. For fishery, forestry and agricultural sidelines he used the official estimates. He found approximately the same rate of growth as the official estimates for the agricultural sector as a whole in 1952-90, but his level of value added was nearly one fifth higher in 1990. In view of the close congruence of the official and Maddison estimates up to 1990, the official estimates for this sector have been used to update the Maddison estimates from 1991 to 2003.
(2) for industry, Wu's (1997) estimates of gross value added in industry were used in Maddison (1998). This was a volume index, with detailed time series on physical output and prices from the China Industrial Economic Statistical Yearbook. Value added was derived from the official input-output table. Wu (2002) presented a bigger sample covering 117 products, and explained in detail why the official figures exaggerated growth. He provided detailed time series showing annual movement for 15 branches of manufacturing as well as mining and utilities. Here he has revised and updated these estimates to 2003. He shows a growth rate of 10.1 per cent a year for industry as a whole for 1952-78, compared to the official 11.5 per cent; and 9.75 per cent a year for 1978-2003 compared to the official 11.5 per cent. (see tables 3, 4 and 6 below). Figure 2 compares the time-profile of the official and the Wu estimates for industry. The profile of the two estimates is very different in the 1990s, with Wu showing a distinct slowdown of growth in 1996-98, and faster growth than the official estimates thereafter. It seems clear that the official estimates for industry involved a smoothing of the growth path in the 1990s.
(3) In the old Soviet-style national accounts "non-material services" were excluded from "material product". These are banking, insurance, housing services, administration of real estate, social services, health, education, entertainment, personal services, R & D activities, the armed forces, police, government and party organisations. They are now incorporated in the Chinese accounts, but the estimates are not shown explicitly. Official estimates show an estimate for the "tertiary" sector as a whole, and a breakdown for two component sub-sectors (transport and commerce). The estimate for non-material services is a residual which the reader has to derive for him or herself. As GDP originating in this sub-sector is bigger than in transport or commerce, it suggests that the residual treatment reflects official qualms about its measure for this sector.
The international standardised System of National Accounts (1993, p. 134), recommends valuation of non-market output by the cost of labour input minus intermediate consumption. NBS credits these activities with improbably high rates of growth of labour productivity (1.5 per cent per annum per person employed for 195278 and 5.1 per cent for 1978-2003). Maddison (1998) made a rough alternative estimate, assuming no increase in productivity in these activities. He used employment as a proxy indicator of growth in real value added, and the same assumption is made in the present estimates. He used the employment estimates in the NBS Statistical Yearbooks, adjusted them from an end-year to a mid-year basis, and added a proxy estimate of 3 million a year for the military which were not included in the official figures until 1992 (see Maddison 1998, p, 171). Here these Maddison estimates have been updated to 2003 (see Table 8).
3

(4) for construction, Maddison (1998) used the official figures for 1952 onwards, and this has been done here. (5) for the sectors "transport and communications" and "commerce and restaurants", official volume figures were used for 1957 onwards. For 1952-57, Liu and Yeh (1965) estimates were used because they included estimates for traditional modes of transport and for the activity of pedlars which seem to have been omitted from the official estimates. In 2006, the NBS made a significant upward adjustment to its earlier estimates of growth in these two sectors for 1993 onwards (see section III below).
The need for adjustment of the Chinese official estimates was acknowledged by official statisticians (Xu Xianchun, Deputy Commissioner of NBS (National Bureau of Statistics), and Ye Yanfei, former head of the social division): "There can be no doubt that China's official national accounts are regarded with suspicion by many users outside China. Professor Maddison's 1998 study raised serious questions about both the levels and growth rates of China's GDP. His criticism carries particular weight because it is based on a careful reworking of the GDP estimates and because he consulted widely with Chinese scholars who have first-hand knowledge of economic developments in China." " the sheer size of China, together with the limited resources currently devoted to national accounts and the continuation of MPS-oriented statistical procedures, inevitably means that the official GDP estimates are subject to margins of error that are somewhat bigger than for other developing countries and substantially larger compared with most other OECD countries" "A reasonable assessment might be that the official growth estimates represent an upper bound and the Maddison estimates a lower bound, with the true growth rates lying somewhere between the two".
(III) Recent Upward Revision of Official Estimates for the Service Sector The Chinese statistical office produces two types of basic survey which
provide crosschecks on the accuracy of the national accounts. The first input-output estimates for the whole economy appeared in 1987. They were used to estimate sector value added in Maddison (1998). Since then, condensed input-output tables were published for 1990, 1995 and 2000, and a full-scale set of tables for 1992, 1997 and 2002.
The other major source of information is the census of economic activity. A first industrial census was taken in the 1950s, a second for 1985, and a third for 1995. There was a census for the service sector in 1993 and a rather slim census for agriculture in 1996. The latest census for 2004 covered the whole economy excluding agriculture. Its results were published in four volumes in January 2006. The respondents had to supply information on the value of their sales between January 1 and December 31 of 2004 at current prices; estimates of their capital stock (at book value), employment, wages, taxes, debt, but nothing on value added. In the light of this new information, the statistical office made a substantial upward adjustment in its measure of GDP growth in the two service sectors transport and communication and commerce for 1993-2004. We have accepted these revised official estimates. However, we have some reservations, as the updating was done with current price information, and it is not clear whether all of the increase should have been assumed to occur after 1992.
The revised estimates were presented in the 2006 Yearbook. NBS calculated a new trend in the value of output in current prices for the years 1992 and 2004, and compared it with the trend based on its former estimates for this period. The ratio of the two trends was used to inflate the former estimates of the year-to-year change in the component series of real GDP. Table 2 shows the outcome of this procedure in
4

real terms-it involved an increase annual average real GDP growth from 9.4 to 9.9 per

cent for 1992-2003, the new Maddison-Wu estimate shows an 8.7 growth rate.

The bottom panel of Table 2 shows the Maddison-Wu estimates. The columns

for industry, non-material services and GDP differ markedly from the NBS estimates.

(IV)Wu's Alternative Estimates of Industrial Performance NBS derives its aggregate measure of industrial performance by cumulating
returns from enterprises with very few independent checks. These returns show output in current and in "comparable" prices. In order to measure "comparable" prices, enterprises are given price manuals which specify the prices they are to use for benchmark years. However the specification manuals do not cover all items produced

5

or specify in sufficient detail. State enterprises have an incentive to exaggerate

performance by understating inflation. Although there are penalties for falsification,

there are substantial possibilities for exaggerating the volume of output when new

products are incorporated into the reporting system at so-called "comparable" prices..

Many of the new small-scale non-state enterprises cannot or do not bother to

distinguish between current and "comparable" prices, so the tendency to understate

inflation has increased

Wu (1997, 2000, and 2002) made alternative estimates of industrial value

added in constant 1987 prices for 1952 onwards which are much better than the

official figures for several reasons. They are based on physical indicators for a

relatively large number of products from the official Industrial Economic Statistics

Yearbooks, with 1987 value added weights from NBS, Input Output Table of China

1987 (199l, pp.147-62). The exercise is fully transparent and follows methods used in

Western countries. The procedure is rather like that for measuring farm output, except

that it was not possible to adjust for possible changes in input ratios over time. The

coverage corresponds to that in Western definitions (ie. it excludes forestry products

and repair and maintenance which are included in the official statistics for industry).

There is a breakdown for 17 sectors: mining, utilities, and 15 manufacturing sectors,

following the standard industrial classification. Table 3 provides a comparative

picture of the pace of advance in different sectors and the locus of structural change.

The time-profile of the Wu estimates of industrial value added in Figure 1 shows

slower growth than the official estimates for 1996-1999, and significantly faster

growth thereafter. This suggests that the official estimates of growth performance in

recent years have been smoothed.

(V) Alternative Estimates for Non-Material Services

In the old Soviet-style national accounts so-called "non-material services"

were excluded from "material product". They are now incorporated in the Chinese

accounts. All are measurement resistant. NBS credits these activities with labour

productivity growth averaging 3.2 percent a year from 1952 to 2003), but the

international standardised System of National Accounts (1993, p. 134), recommends

valuation of non-market output by the cost of labour input minus intermediate

consumption. Table 5 shows the situation in OECD countries, where the average

practice is to assume virtually zero productivity growth in this sector:

NB: this table corrects errors for 1981 and 1985 employment in Maddison (1998), p. 171. Until 1992, the official

figures excluded the military. It was assumed that the military are included in the official figures from 1993.

Official figures are not available for total employment in 2003; 113,370 is an estimate of Ximing Yue.

Table 6 replicates and updates the procedure used in Maddison (1998) to provide an alternative measure of GDP in the "non-material" service sector, assuming no increase in productivity in these activities. Employment is used as a proxy indicator of growth in real value added. The employment estimates for this sector in the NBS Statistical Yearbooks were used, with two modifications: (i) adjusting the official employment estimates from an end-year to a mid-year basis (see first column), and (ii) adding a proxy estimate of 3 million a year for military personnel who were not included in the official estimates until 1993 (see China Labour Statistics Yearbook, 1994). Maddison augmented the 1987 weight for this sector, as the official coverage appeared to be inadequate. It substantially undervalued housing and military outlays, and probably did not cover welfare benefits in kind which were provided free to employees of state enterprises.
The fourth column of Table 6 shows the Maddison estimates of GDP growth in this sector, in 1987 yuan. The annual movement is the same as for employment (shown in the third column). Column five shows the official estimates of GDP growth in this sector. They are also in 1987 prices.
Table 7 shows official employment statistics for the whole economy for 19522002, with a fourfold sector breakdown which is the best we can do if we want a consistent picture for the whole period. The estimates for 1952-78 were derived from NBS, Statistical Yearbook of China (1993, Chinese version), pp. 100-101. It provided a four sector breakdown: a) for the primary sector; b) for the secondary sector; c) for the "material" service sector, and d) for the "non-material" service sector. For 19782002, much more detail was available for sixteen branches. However the total coverage was consistent with the earlier estimates. In Table 7 they are aggregated into four sectors for the whole period.
The 16 branch breakdown included a consolidated estimate for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries; 4 separate components for the secondary sector-mining, manufacturing, construction and utilities (gas, water and electricity); 3 components for "material" services-transport and communications, wholesale and retail trade, and geological prospecting; and 8 components for "non-material" activity. For 1978-85 estimates were derived from the 1994 Yearbook, p. 68; 1985-89 from the 2000 Yearbook, pp. 120-121, 1989-2002 from the 2006 Yearbook, p. 130.
An Important Incongruity in the Official Estimates of Employment Until 1997, The NBS had, in addition to the sixteen branch breakdown (pp. 92-93), more aggregative employment estimates for 3 sectors, primary, secondary and tertiary (pp. 87). The figure for total employment was the same in the two tables. In Yearbooks from 1997 onwards, there is a discrepancy between the two tables. Total employment in the 3 sector table is much bigger than for the 16 sectors. In the 2006 Yearbook (pp. 128 & 130), the 3 sector total for 1990 (end-year) was 647.5 million and the actual total for the 16 sectors was 567.4 million. Hence a discrepancy of 80.1 million. For 2002, the discrepancy had risen to 99.6 million. Instead of explaining the discrepancy, the Yearbooks disguised it by showing the same "total" for the 16 sector breakdown as for the three sector aggregate. The 16 sector series continues to be published, but the figures stop at the year 2002 in the last four Yearbooks. It would seem that the 3 sector breakdown is derived from the sample population census (see Yue, 2005) and the sixteen sector breakdown from labour force statistics, but users of the employment figures are entitled to a detailed explanation or reconciliation of the two types of estimate. They are also
10

entitled to know why the 16 sector breakdown has been discontinued. In the present situation, meaningful measurement of labour productivity is no longer possible.

(VI) Summary of Maddison-Wu Results Figure 2 shows the difference between the official measure of GDP growth, and the Maddison-Wu estimates. Both are shown as volume indices benchmarked on 1990. Tables 8 and 9 provide a full annual six-sector picture for 1952-2003. Here one can scrutinise the impact of the Maddison-Wu amendments in detail. Thus for the reform period 1978-2003, the official GDP growth rate is 9.59 per cent per annum. Replacing column 2 of table 9 for industry by column 2 of table 8 lowers the growth rate to 8.8 per cent. Replacing column 6 for non-material services reduces the growth rate further to 7.98. Replacing column 1 for agriculture reduces the growth rate to 7.85. Thus the adjustment for non-material services has a slightly bigger impact than that for industry.

Source for Table 8 Agriculture 1952-90 from Maddison (1998), 1990-2003 from official index. Industry 1952-2003, Wu estimates, see table 4. Construction 19522003, official estimates. Transport and communication and commerce 1952-57 from Liu and Yeh (1965), thereafter official estimates. Non-material services assumed to move parallel to growth in employment (see table 6). 1987 weights were used for these Maddison­Wu estimates. Source for Table 9 1952-78 from Historical National Accounts of the People's Republic of China (1997) pp. 61 and 70-71. This was a joint study of SSB (State Statistical Bureau as NBS was then called) and the Institute of Economic Research of Hitotsubashi University in Japan. It provided SNA type estimates for the volume movement in each sector and for the value of output in each sector at current prices. Here they are updated to 2003, using the NBS Yearbook (2006, p. 60) for volume movement in each sector. SSB-Hitotsubashi did not show estimates at constant prices as we have in table 9, nor did it explain what weights it used to arrive at its total GDP index. Although the volume movement in each of the six sectors in table 9 is the same as in SSB-Hitotsubashi, their GDP index showed faster growth than our aggregate GDP estimates at 1987 prices. This is due to the fact that the official GDP index was constructed in linked segments (see Xu and Ye (2000, p. 18). NBS does not explain what weights it uses to arrive at its total GDP index for 1978-2003; however, it shows

12

a volume movement identical with that in Table 9, where 1987 weights are used. Both show an average annual growth of 9.59 per cent. TABLE 8 MADDISON-WU ESTIMATES OF CHINESE GDP BY SECTOR, 1952-2003

(VII) Major Conclusions 1) As the Chinese currency is greatly undervalued, it is particularly important to measure its GDP level using a purchasing power (PPP) converter. In 2003, its GDP was about three-quarters of the US level. With exchange rate conversion, it was only 15 percent. In fact, all valid cross-country, regional or world GDP comparisons require PPP converters. 2) Chinese official statistics exaggerate the pace of growth by use of dubious deflators. Our revisions show GDP growth of 7.85 per cent a year 1978-2003, compared with the official rate of 9.59 per cent. In making adjustments for China, we follow normal practice in eliminating idiosyncrasies in official statistics to enhance the validity of inter-temporal and cross-country comparisons. 3) The two major areas where we amended the official estimates were industry and the measurement-resistant part of the service sector. The alternative Wu measure of industrial performance is based on quantitative indicators. It is specified in great detail and seems clearly superior to the official estimates for this sector, which accounted for 55 per cent of official GDP in 2003. We feel that NBS should give serious consideration to using the Wu approach to improve its estimate for this sector. 4) Our second major adjustment, for "non-material" services, is much cruder than our industry adjustment. This sector represented 15.6 per cent of official GDP in 2003.We assumed that there was no productivity growth in this sector and used employment as an indicator of the growth of value added. The implicit official estimate for labour productivity in this sector was 5.1 per cent a year for 1978-2002, which is higher than the rate for other services (transport and commerce combined) where productivity grew 4.8 per cent a year, and for agriculture, where productivity rose 4 per cent a year. The relative pace of growth seems implausible and out of line with the experience of other countries (see Table 5). It would be very useful to have more detail on the official deflation procedures for this sector. At the moment it is something of a pariah in the official accounts; it is not shown explicitly, but as a residual in the official estimate for the tertiary sector. 5) We strongly recommend that the official statement of the GDP accounts in the China Yearbook be expanded. At the moment information is provided on GDP in current prices and volume movement. It would be very useful to have a table showing GDP and its six component sectors in constant prices (as in Tables 8 and 9). Such a change would require no research, but add considerably to the transparency of the accounts. 6) Our estimates suggest quite strongly that official GDP statistics were subjected to a smoothing procedure to disguise a significant slowdown of output growth in 19961998 (see Table 2). 7) The official estimates of employment in the China Yearbook have deteriorated significantly in the last four years. The 16 sector breakdown which was available for 1978-2002 has been discontinued, and in its place there is only a rough 3 sector breakdown. The large discrepancy between them has been disguised instead of being explained. In the present situation, meaningful measurement of labour productivity is no longer possible.
