The red blood cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity of every donor was examined with automatic enzyme-coupled method. The technique of molecular biology was applied to determine the DNA mutations for the 97 donors with undetectable G6PD activity. The concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the stored RBC of the 97 G6PD-deficient donors and 124 normal donors was determined with the technique of high performance liquid chromatography. Routine blood counts, bilirubin and haptoglobin levels were used to evaluate posttransfusional hemolysis for the 48 adult patients transfused with 1 U G6PD deficient and 1 U normal RBC. Most (88, 90.7%) of the 97 donors were confirmed to be G6PD deficient at the DNA level. At each age interval of storage, the GSH concentration of G6PD-deficient RBC was significantly different from that of normal RBC. The total average value of GSH (µmol/gHb) was 2.52 ± 0.95 (mean ± 1 standard deviation) vs. 3.74 ± 1.43 (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, bilirubin, and haptoglobin levels in the patients receiving G6PD-deficient RBC were not statistically different from those in the recipients of normal RBC; even though the age of stored blood was 26­35 days. Within the same group of patients, the results of bilirubin and haptoglobin were not significantly changed before and after transfusion. The results of this study show that the GSH concentration in the stored blood of G6PD deficient donors was 67% of that in the normal donors. However, hemolysis does not occur in adult patients transfused with 1 U G6PD-deficient RBC. It seems unnecessary to screen G6PD activity for donors of adult recipients in Taiwan. Am. J.

INTRODUCTION
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common one of all clinically significant enzyme defects. Since G6PD deficiency is definitely associated with hemolysis [1], studies concerning the mechanism of hemolytic reaction including that occurring in blood transfusion are important topics for G6PD deficiency. Exchange transfusion of G6PD-deficient blood has been found to cause hemolysis in infants [2,3] and exaggeration of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [4]. It has been noted that posttransfusion viability of autologous G6PD-deficient A- blood was inferior to that of normal cells [5]. A minor hemolytic reaction as slight increases in bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase level

was found in adults receiving a unit of severely G6PDdeficient blood [6,7]. However, the mechanism of storage change in G6PD-deficient blood during conventional blood banking has never been studied.
The prevalence of G6PD deficiency in male Taiwanese is approximately 3.0% [8­10]. We and others have shown that at least 12 different types of G6PD mutation

at the DNA level are responsible for G6PD deficiency in Taiwan [9­15]. Since most of the mutations in Taiwanese are severely deficient WHO-class 2 variants, it seems to be necessary to study the circumstance of transfusion from the donors with G6PD deficiency. In this report, we investigated the reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration of 97 G6PD-deficient stored blood and the consequences of 48 adult recipients transfused with that blood. To our knowledge no such large body of data has been reported previously.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Donation Blood
All the donated blood was obtained from the Taipei Blood Donation Center. Blood donations of 250 ml (1 U, regulation set by the Taiwanese Department of Health) were collected in a standard commercial plastic bag with CPDA-1 as anticoagulant, then made to be packed RBC (180­200 ml) and stored at 2­6° in a blood bank for up to 35 days.
Determination of G6PD Activity and Mutation Types
The quantitation of G6PD activity for every donor's blood was measured by the automated enzyme-coupled method as described [16]. Any subjects with G6PD activity below 4.0 IU/gHb were defined as having G6PD deficiency. For the research of severely G6PD-deficient blood, 97 donors with undetectable G6PD activity (0 IU/gHb) were selected as the study group. The G6PD mutations were identified at the DNA level on the thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) by using the nine primers as described [10] and three additional primers as listed in Table I. The restriction enzymes were obtained from Biolabs Co. (Beverly, MA).
Determination of GSH
One milliliter of blood was lysed by ultrasonic vibration (full power for 5 min on Heat System XL 2020 Sonicator, Farmingdale, NY), then deproteinized with 3 ml of absolute methyl alcohol (obtained from JT Baker Co., Phillipsburg, NJ). After centrifugation (13,000g for 10 min), GSH of the supernatant was determined by the

technique of high performance liquid chromatography (Hewlett-Parckard 1050 series, Waldbronn, Germany) as described [17]. The concentration of GSH in each specimen was expressed as mol/gHb. The stored blood of 124 subjects with normal G6PD activity was chosen as the control.
Patients
All the recipients were adults. They did not have oxidative stress, did not have irregular antibodies, had normal liver function tests, normal bilirubin (0.2­1.2 mg/dl) (performed on Hitachi 747 analyzer, Tokyo, Japan) and haptoglobin (30­140 mg/dl) (performed on Beckman Array Protein System, Brea, CA) before transfusion, were not treated with oxidative medications liable to induce hemolysis in G6PD deficiency [1], and no more blood was transfused during the study period. In order to collect enough numbers (N  16 for each group) for study, three groups of patients were chosen as the study subjects. There were patients with anemia of chronic disease, gastrointestinal tract bleeding, and blood loss of 100­250 ml during surgery, respectively. Each of the 48 study recipients was transfused with 1 U of G6PD-deficient packed RBC and 1 U age-matched normal packed RBC. The reason for this combination is that the probability that both units of the donated blood being G6PD deficient is very low, since the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Taiwan is 3%. Each of the 48 control recipients was transfused with 2 U normal packed RBC. The time from phlebotomy to transfusion of all the units was divided into two groups, 11­20 days and 26­35 days. Tests of complete blood count (performed on Sysmex NE-8000, Kyoto, Japan), bilirubin, and haptoglobin were done for all recipients 24, 48, and 72 hr after transfusion.
Statistical Analysis
Linear regression, two-tailed Student's t-test and paired t-test as appropriate were used to analyze the data. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
The mutation types of the 97 donors with undetectable G6PD activity were analyzed as those listed in Table II.

Figure 1 shows that, in each age interval of stored blood, the GSH concentration (mol/gHb) of G6PD-deficient subjects was significantly different from that of the control subjects. Mean ± 1 SD: 3.35 ± 0.86 vs. 4.25 ± 1.30 at 6­10 days, 2.69 ± 0.95 vs. 4.20 ± 1.73 at 11­15 days, 2.46 ± 0.99 vs. 3.86 ± 1.25 at 16­20 days, 2.34 ± 1.12 vs. 3.43 ± 1.23 at 21­25 days, 2.21 ± 0.92 vs. 3.35 ± 1.25 at 26­30 days, 2.11 ± 0.84 vs. 2.95 ± 0.76 at 31­35 days of storage, and 2.52 ± 0.95 vs. 3.74 ± 1.43 in total. The results of linear regression analysis for the relationship between GSH concentration (Y) and age (day, X) of stored blood were Y  -0.033 × +3.214, r  0.278 (N  97, P  0.0080) for G6PD deficient subjects and Y  -0.055 × +4.740, r  -0.274 (N  124, P  0.0037) for control subjects, respectively.
The data listed in Table III indicate that there was no difference in the severity of the anemia between the study group and control group in each of the three kinds of patients. Table III also shows that the effectiveness in correcting the anemia by transfusing G6PD-deficient RBC was equal to that of normal RBC even though the age of blood was 26­35 days.

concentrations of bilirubin and haptoglobin in the recipients transfused with G6PD-deficient RBC of both 11­20 and 26­35 days old were not different from those in the recipients of age-matched normal RBC at pretransfusion, 24, 48, and 72 hr after transfusion. The results of the paired t-test in each kind of patients also showed that there was no significant difference in bilirubin and haptoglobin between 24, 48, or 72 hr after transfusion and pretransfusion.
DISCUSSION
We [9,10,14,15] and other scientists [11­13] have found that at least 12 different types of mutation are responsible for Taiwanese with G6PD deficiency. Those data also show that among the mutation types the nucleotide substitution (nt) of 1,376 predominates. In this report, we show the occurrence rates of the 12 types in the 97 donors with undetectable G6PD activity are similar to those we found in neonates [10], except that nt 517 [15] and nt 519 [18] are new findings. Our results also confirm that most (>90%) of the 97 donors are G6PD deficient at the DNA level. The nt 1,376 accounts for 45.4% of the 97 subjects, and is also the most popular variant.
G6PD is responsible for the generation of nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) in the hexose monophosphate pathway (HMP). The HMP is the only source of NADPH in RBC [1]. NADPH is a cofactor involved in maintaining glutathione in the reduced form (GSH), which is an important substance in the protection of RBC against oxidative damage [19]. Beutler et al [20] reported that content of GSH was lower in primaquine sensitive red cells than in normal cells. Al-Ali [21] has observed a decreased value of GSH in the subjects with G6PD deficiency when compared to normal. In this investigation, we also find that the GSH concentration in the stored blood of G6PD-deficient donors was statistically different from that of normal RBC. The former was 67% of the latter in average. Moreover, our results indicate that the GSH value slightly declines with the age of storage in both G6PD-deficient and normal RBC.
A decrease in the GSH level may influence the life span of stored RBC in some ethnics. Shalev et al. [6] have found that an immediate posttransfusional hemolysis reaction occurred in 6 of 10 recipients of G6PDdeficient RBC in Israeli subjects. Although they did not examine the GSH concentration for that blood, the authors postulate that the oxidation-mediated storage lesions that occurred in normal RBC are amplified in G6PD deficiency, further restricting their posttransfusional life-span, eventuating in posttransfusional hemolysis. In contrast, McCurdy and Morse [22] and Kuhn et al. [23] reported that the evaluation of the patients who

received G6PD-A- blood failed to reveal any hemolytic reaction.
We did not find any hemolysis cases in our study subjects, since the serum bilirubin and haptoglobin values in the recipients of G6PD-deficient RBC were not significantly changed after transfusion and were not different from those in the control subjects. The contradiction between our results and those from Shalev et al. [6] may be due to different types of G6PD mutation in the two groups studied. The most popular type of mutations in G6PD-Mediterranean is nt 563 with a silent mutation at nt 1,311 [24], while nt 1,376 predominates in Taiwan. Different types of G6PD mutation may lead to different biochemical and clinical characteristics. For instance, G6PD-Mediterranean owns a B-like electrophoretic mobility [24] and has been found to cause moderate hemolysis during the steady state [25], while nt 1,376 shows fast electrophoretic mobility [26] and is highly associated with neonatal jaundice in Taiwanese [10,13]. Therefore, different outcomes of blood storage may occur among different types of G6PD mutation. The decreases of GSH and antioxidant function in G6PD-Mediterranean stored blood may be more severe than those in G6PD-nt 1,376. Since posttransfusional hemolysis reaction is not observed in our patients transfused with G6PD-deficient RBC, it seems unnecessary to screen G6PD activity for blood donors of adult recipients in Taiwan.
