ABSTRACT Energy intake, weight gain, carcass composition, plasma fuels, hepatic metabolites and lipogenic enzyme activities were studied in adult rats fed either a low fat, high carbohydrate (LF) diet or one of two fat-containing diets in which 32% of the metabolizable energy was constituted by long-chain triglyc Ã©rides(LCT) or medium-chain triglycÃ©rides(MCT). Compared with the LF diet, the MCT diet did not depress food and energy intake, weight gain, energy and nitrogen retention or lipid deposition and did not produce ketogenesis. The weight gain of rats fed LCT was 25% higher, and increased lipid deposition was observed. Lower lipogenic enzyme activities were ob served in rats fed the LF diet containing 4% corn oil than in rats fed the MCT diet containing 1% corn oil. This effect disappeared when rats previously adapted to the LCT diet were fed LF or MCT diets containing 1% corn oil for 21 d. By d 21, in both groups, hepatic malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase activities were 2.2-, 2.0-, 2.3- and 1.8-fold higher than those of rats fed LCT. Intermediate hepatic glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-
nase activities were observed in rats fed the MCT diet, compared with LCT (40% lower) and LF (1.6-fold
higher) diets. These data show that in rats fed a diet in which MCT supplies 32% of metabolizable energy, a high activity of lipogenic enzymes is observed, sug gesting that MCThad no inhibitory effect on the activity of these enzymes. J. Nutr. 121: 585-594, 1991.

consequences of MCT ingestion. Indeed, long-term feeding of MCT-containing diets causes a decrease in
plasma lipids (3) and in the deposition of fat in adipose tissue (3-6) and an increase in blood ketone bodies (3).
The body weight gain of rats did not change (2) or was decreased (3, 4), and the net protein utilization in rats was not altered (7). More recently, Crozier et al. (8) reported that MCT diets did not change the plasma insulin and glucagon levels but reduced the energy retention, which resulted in a 60% decrease in the daily lipid deposition. In these experiments, rats adapted to high MCT intake by decreasing the initial hyperketone-
mia (5 mmol/L) by 50%. Most of the observations de scribed previously were obtained from experiments in which MCT provided more than 60% of the dietary energy and the contribution of carbohydrate was low.
One aim of this study was to investigate the time course of the metabolic changes during long-term MCT feeding in which MCT supply was moderate (-30% of
dietary energy), relative to previous animal experi ments, and thus more appropriate for practical purposes. The results obtained with MCT were compared with those resulting from long-term feeding of a diet contain
ing LCT, shown previously to increase fat deposition in adipose tissue and to decrease markedly the activity of lipogenic enzymes in liver and adipose tissue (9). Some studies involving MCT diets suggested that MCT had lower inhibitory effects on the activity of some lipoge nic enzymes in liver and adipose tissue than does dietary

In 1951, Bloom et al. (1) reported that dietary me dium-chain triglycÃ©rides (MCT)3 are more completely
hydrolyzed than long-chain triglycÃ©rides (LCT). The medium-chain fatty acids released are then rapidly ab
sorbed and transported via the portal vein into the liver, where they seem to be extensively oxidized. Since these observations were made, MCT have been used to pro vide energy to patients with malabsorption syndromes (2), and much has been learned about the metabolic

LCT (4, 8, 10). More recently, Takase and Hosoya (11) reported that the MCT inhibitory effect on malic en zyme and fatty acid synthetase activities was dependent on the dietary linoleate supply.
To clarify these aspects, a second experiment was initiated, and we investigated the following: 1) the met abolic changes and activity of lipogenic enzymes in liver in middle-term MCT or low fat, high carbohydrate (LF) feeding, both diets supplying 1% corn oil, and 2) the time course of metabolic changes and hepatic lipogenic enzymes activities during middle-term MCT and LF feeding of rats previously adapted to a LCT diet.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and diets. Male Wistar CF rats (Janvier,Le Genest, France), weighing 150 to 180 g were housed in aintudrievid(2u2alÂc±2aÂg°eCsa)unnddleirghctoinngtro(llliegdhtcforonmditi0o7n0s0 otof te1m90p0erh)
and were adapted to a low fat, high carbohydrate diet (LF1)or to a very low fat, high carbohydrate diet (LF2) for 21 d. The LF1 and LF2 diets were used for Experi ments 1 and 2, respectively. In the long-chain (LCT)and medium-chain (MCT) triglycÃ©ridesdiets, fat replaced the carbohydrate (Table 1). Commercial corn oil was used as the source of LCT. The fatty acid composition

of LCT was as follows: 14:0 (0.1%), 16:0 (11.7%), 16:1 (0.2%), 18:0 (2.0%), 18:1 (26.5%), 18:2 (56.4%), 18:3 (2.0%), 20:0 (0.8%), 22:0 (0.2%) and 24:0 (0.1%). The MCT were supplied by Nestec (Lausanne, Switzerland) and contained 6:0 (0.2%), 8:0 (56.2%), 10:0 (43.1%) and 12:0 (0.5%).The metabolizable energy as fat of each diet was 10.8, 4.7, 32.8 and 31.5% for LF1, LF2, LCT and MCT diets, respectively (Table 1).
Experimental design
Experiment 1. One hundred fifty-two rats were di vided into three groups of 56, 48 and 48 animals. Eight rats from the first group were killed at the beginning of the experiment (time 0), and thereafter the three groups were fed for ad libitum intake the LF1, the LCT or the MCT diets for 45 d. Food intake and body weight were recorded every 2 and 4 d, respectively. Eight animals from each group were killed (between 0900 and 1000 h) after 1, 4, 8, 15, 25 and 45 d using the procedure pre viously described (14). Briefly, the animals were anes thetized with sodium pentobarbital (7 mg/100 g of body weight i.p.), blood (inferior vena cava) was collected, and one aliquot of liver was freeze-clamped, ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and stored at -180Â°Cuntil
analysis (I.R. Cryogenic Equipment, Union Carbide, Danbury, CT). Another aliquot of liver was stored at

-20"C for enzyme assays. One aliquot of blood (1 mL)
was collected directly in a centrifuge tube containing 1.0 mL of perchloric acid (10%, wt/v) for ketone body determination. Another aliquot of blood (1.5 mL) was collected in a heparinized tube placed on ice and centrifuged, and plasma was stored at -20Â°Cfor further sub
strate determinations. The carcass, without blood and liver, was weighed and frozen at -80Â°Cfor analysis of
body composition. Before the beginning of the experi ment (time 0), the initial body composition of eight rats was determined. Because these rats ate about 0.2 to 0.3 g/h between 0900 and 1000 h, they were considered fed rats.
Experiment 2. In the first experiment the corn oil content of the LF1 and MCT diets (Table 1)was different (4.0 and 1.0 g/100 g, respectively). Therefore, a second experiment was initiated in which the corn oil supply in the two diets was similar (1.0 g/100 g, LF2 and MCT, Table 1). After rats adapted to animal house conditions and LF2 diet, 88 of them were divided into three groups of 8, 8 and 72 animals and were fed for ad libitum intake the LF2, the MCT and LCT diets, respectively, for 21 d. After this period, the groups LF2 and MCT and 8 rats of LCT diet were killed. Thereafter, 64 animals previously fed the LCT diet were divided into two groups that were given ad libitum access to the LF2 and MCT diets, respectively, for 21 d. Eight rats from each group were killed after 2, 7, 14 and 21 d. Food intake, body weight recording, and blood and tissue sampling were similar to Experiment 1, but body composition was not deter mined.
Analytical methods
Plasma. Insulin (15) (in Experiment 2) and glucose (16), triglycÃ©rides, glycerol, total cholesterol (17) and free fatty acids (FFA) (18) were determined by using commercial kits from International-CIS (Gif-surYvette, France), Boehringer (Meylan, France) and Biolyon (Lyon, France), respectively. Blood ketone body concentrations were measured by enzymatic tech niques (17).
Liver metabolites. Glycogen (19) (in both experi ments) and lactate, pyruvate, malate, citrate and ketone bodies (17) were measured in samples of freeze-clamped liver.
Enzyme activities. Enzyme activities were deter mined using frozen (-20Â°C)liver. The activities of malic
enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40) (20), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (EC 1.1.1.49) (21) and phosphoenolpmyerausvuarteed caatrb3o7xÂyk°Cinuasisneg a(PsEuPpeCrKna)ta(nEtC 4f.r1a.c1t.i3o2n) (o2b2t)aiwneerde
by centrifugation at 50,000 x g of a liver homogenate in 0.25 mol/L sucrose. Substrates, enzymes and coenzymes were supplied by Boehringer (Meylan, France), and NaH14CO3 was obtained from C.E.A. (Gif-surYvette, France). The activities of ATP-citrate lyase (EC

4.1.3.8) (23) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) (EC 2.3.1.85) (24) were measured at 37Â°Cusing a supernatant fraction
obtained by centrifugation at 50,000 x g of a liver ho mogenate in 0.143 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was purchased from Amersham, U.K. The activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AcCoACx) (EC 6.4.1.2) was assayed as described by Maeda et al. (24) using a liver homogenate in 0.6 mol/L Tris buffer (pH 7.5). The activities were expressed per milligram of supernatant proteins (25) or per total liver.
Other. Body composition of rats (without blood and liver) was assessed by the method of Abraham et al. (26). The water content of carcasses was first determined by freeze-drying. After acid hydrolysis (12 mol/L HCl, 4 h, 90Â°Ct)he fat content was determined on the hydrolysate
by continuous extraction with petroleum ether. Finally, nitrogen was determined in the fat-free hydrolysate (13). Energy retention, nitrogen retention and lipid gain were derived from the difference between the initial and final body composition and were expressed per day of exper iment.
Statistical analysis of results (SEM,ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test) was carried out according to Snedecor and Cochran (27).
RESULTS
Experiment 1
Energy intake and weight gain. Food intake was not altered by the content of LCT or MCT. Over 45 d, daily energy intakes, although higher for rats fed the LCT diet, were not significantly different (Table 2). However, by d 25, the animals fed the LCT diet were heavier, and by d 45 the weight gain of rats fed the LF1 and MCT diets was 21% (P < 0.05) less than that of LCT group (Fig. 1, Table 2). The energy retention for the MCT group was similar to that of the LF1 group but was 26% (P < 0.05) less than that of LCT group (Table 2). Nitrogen retention was not affected by the fatty acid composition of the diet and was similar in the three experimental groups. The LCT diet increased lipid deposition 1.5- and 1.7-fold (P < 0.05) relative to the MCT and LF1 diets, respectively. Changes in lipid deposition largely explain the differ ence observed in the daily weight gain between the three groups of rats (Table 2).
Concentrations of plasma glucose and Â¡ipids and blood ketone bodies. No significant differences were observed in concentrations of plasma glucose, triglycÃ©r ides, FFA, glycerol or cholesterol throughout the exper iment between the rats fed LF1, LCT or MCT diets (results not shown). Blood ketone body concentrations in rats fed the MCT diet were initially slightly elevated (d 1, 4 and 25) compared with those in LF1 or LCT groups, but by d 45, blood ketone bodies were similar in the three groups (Fig. 2).

uvate ratio, malate, citrate or ketone bodies throughout the experiment among the rats fed LF1, LCT or MCT diets (results not shown). The hepatic ketone body con-

centrations in the blood of rats in the three groups also were low and within physiological ranges (results not shown). At the end of the experiment, the hepatic gly-
cogen concentration was similar in the LF1 and MCT groups (350 Â±10 and 311 Â±11 umol glucose/g, respec tively), but it was lower (264 Â±14 umol glucose/g) (P <

liver (results not shown) or per milligram of protein (Fig. 3), changes in hepatic enzyme activities were similar.

fed rats. In contrast, LCT decreased progressively the hepatic activity of enzymes involved in lipogenesis and at the end of experiment the activities of G6PDH, malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, AcCoACx and FASwere 40,
30,55, 50 and 45% lower, respectively, than those of LF1 animals. However, the decrease of hepatic malic en zyme activity was not statistically significant. On the first days of LCT or MCT diet consumption, an increase in liver PEPCK activity was observed. Thereafter, in rats fed MCT diet, PEPCK activity returned to the LF1group level, but in rats fed LCT diet it remained 1.6-fold (P < 0.05) higher than that of rats fed the LF1 and MCT diets until the end of experiment (Fig.3).
Experiment 2
Energy intake and weight gain. As reported in Ex periment 1, no significant differences were observed in energy intake, daily weight gain and food efficiency ratio (FER, energy intake/body weight gain) between rats fed LF2 or MCT diets (Table 3). However, by d 21 the weight gain was greater and the FER was 30% (P < 0.05) lower in rats fed the LCT diet than in rats fed the MCT diet. The metabolic response to changing from the LCT to the MCT or LF2 diets was delayed in MCT rats. Indeed, during the 1st wk of the experiment the energy intake and weight gain were lower and the FER was greater in

MCT-fed animals than in LF2-fed animals (Fig. 4).
Thereafter (during d 7 to 14), energy intake and weight gain of MCT-fed rats rose greatly, but by the end of
experiment (d 21) no significant differences were ob served between LF2 and MCT rats (Fig.4).

Rats were fed the long-chain triglycÃ©ride (LCT) diet for 21 d. Thereafter, they were shifted to LF2 or MCT diets for 21 d. Each column represents the mean Â±SEM of eight rats. Means not associated with the same superscript letter (a, b, c for MCT) are significantly different (NewmanKeuls test) (P < 0.05); comparisons between LF2 and MCT diets: *P < 0.05; *'P < 0.01 (ANOVA).

were observed in plasma insulin, glucose, triglycÃ©rides and blood ketone body concentrations among LF2, MCT and LCT diets (results not shown). However, by d 21, the animals fed the LCT diet had higher plasma choles terol concentrations than those fed the LF2 or MCT diet (LCT = 2.49 Â±0.11 mmol/L > LF2 = 1.70 Â±0.18 mmol/L and MCT = 1.52 Â±0.11 mmol/L; P < 0.05).
No alterations were observed in plasma insulin, glu cose, triglycÃ©rides and blood ketone body concentra tions when the LCT diet was replaced by the LF2 diet. In contrast, the LF2 diet lowered significantly the plasma cholesterol (Fig. 5). No significant differences were observed in plasma glucose and triglycÃ©rides by replacing the LCT diet with the MCT diet, but the MCT diet lowered plasma cholesterol throughout the experi ment (Fig. 5). In addition, the MCT diet decreased the plasma insulin (d 7) and increased ketonemia between d 7 and 14 (Fig. 5). These alterations were concomitant with changes in energy intake and body weight gain (Fig. 4). However, at the end of the experiment, no differences were observed in plasma insulin and blood ketone bod ies between animals fed the LF2 and MCT diets, but plasma cholesterol level was lower in rats fed the MCT diet (Fig. 5).
Liver weight and hepatic glycogen. No significant differences were found in liver weight (by d 21 ) between the rats fed LF2, MCT or LCT diets (results not shown). As in Experiment 1, the hepatic glycogen concentration was similar in the LF2 and MCT groups (288 Â±15 and 268 Â±12umol glucose liver/g, respectively), but it was 50% lower (P < 0.05) in the LCT group (199 Â±9 umol glucose/g liver).
No significant differences were observed in liver weight between the LF2 and MCT rats when LF2 and MCT diets replaced LCT diet (results not shown). As the experiment progressed, the hepatic glycogen concentra tion of rats fed LF2 and MCT diets increased, and by d 21 it was similar (313 Â±20 and 306 Â±13umol glucose/g liver in the two groups but was 1.5-fold higher (P < 0.05) than in LCT-fed rats (199 u 9 umol glucose/g liver).
Liver enzyme activity. By d 21, hepatic malic en zyme, ATP-citrate lyase, AcCoACx and FAS activities were similar in LF2- and MCT-fed rats and were 2.2-, 2.0-, 2.3-and 1.8-fold higher (P< 0.05), respectively, than those in LCT-fed rats (Table 4). hi rats fed the MCT diet, the hepatic G6PDH activity was 1.8-fold higher than
that of LCT rats but 41 % less than that of LF2 rats (Table 4). The change from a LCT diet to LF2 or MCT diets was followed by an increase in hepatic lipogenic enzyme activity, which was higher in LF2-fed rats than in MCT-
fed rats on d 14 (Fig. 6). However, at the end of the experiment (d 21), no differences were observed in lipo genic enzyme activities between the LF2 and MCT rats, and the hepatic G6PDH, malic enzyme, ATP-citrate lyase, AcCoACx and FAS activities were 2, 0-, 1.8-, 2.2-, 1.8- and 1.8-fold higher, respectively, in LF2 and MCT
groups than those in the LCT group (Table 4).

FIGURE 5 Plasma insulin and cholesterol, and blood ketone bodies in rats fed very low fat (LF2, D) and medium-chain triglycÃ©ride(MCT, â¢)diets for 21 d. Rats were fed a LCT diet for 21 d. Thereafter, they were shifted to LF2 or MCT diets for 21 d. Each point represents the mean Â±SEM of eight rats. Means not associated with the same superscript letter (a, b, c for LF2, and x, y, z for MCT) are significantly different (Newman-Keuls test) (P < 0.05); comparison between LF2 and MCT diets: 'P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 (ANOVA).

The present data show that changing from a low fat diet (LF1or LF2) to a diet containing 30% of energy as
MCT did not depress food and energy intake and weight
gain (3), energy and nitrogen retention, or lipid deposi tion. These results disagree with experiments in which predominant replacement of dietary carbohydrate by MCT (-60% of metabolizable energy) mildly reduced
the energy intake (8)but markedly decreased the body weight gain (4, 8), energy retention (8), depot size of
adipose tissue (4, 6) and body lipid deposition (8). Me dium-chain triglycÃ©rideasre rapidly digested, absorbed,
transported to the liver as FFAand oxidized extensively (2). A single oral load of MCT (28-30) or long-term feeding of a diet rich in MCT (2,3, 8) enhances ketogenesis and is associated with a high ÃY-hydroxybutyrate: acetoacetate ratio in blood and liver, a high lactate:pyr-
uvate ratio in liver, and decreased hepatic oxaloacetate concentration (8).Moreover, MCT may induce thermo-
genesis, resulting in dissipation of energy as heat that may be responsible for the reduction of carcass lipid accumulation (31).However, the present results do not show high rates of ketogenesis (Fig. 2) or changes in hepatic lactate, pyruvate or malate concentrations and lactate:pyruvate ratio during the experimental period.
This may be attributable to the relatively moderate dietary content of MCT in our animal experiments. This level is still high when compared with use of MCT in human nutrition. The contribution of carbohydrate was increased to 50% of metabolizable energy. In rela tion to these changes in energy supply, the hyperketone-
mia induced by an MCT load can be practically abolished by the simultaneous administration of glu cose (28).Moreover, the simultaneous administration of MCT and oxaloacetic acid donors noticeably reduces the production of ketone bodies from MCT in rats (30).
As shown previously, the change from a low fat diet (LF1 or LF2) to a LCT-containing diet resulted in an
increase in body weight gain (8). Because the energy intake was similar in the three groups, the increase in body weight gain due to the LCT diet apparently can only be attributed to a decrease in the food efficiency ratio (energy intake/body weight gain). This may be related to the fact that after their digestion and absorp tion LCT are transported as chylomicrons via the lym phatic system and general circulation to adipose tissue, where they are stored as lipids. Such a mechanism has been shown to be responsible for the obesity induced by high fat (LCT)diets in rats (9,32). This also explains why the daily lipid gain of LCT-fed rats was higher than that of LF- and MCT-fed groups.
Our results show that the amount of nitrogen re tained in the carcass of rats fed the LF1, LCT and MCT diets was similar. In relation to this observation, Ling et al. (7)showed that when carbohydrate supplies 48% of

With regard to MCT and LCT diets, the present results show that hepatic G6PDH, malic enzyme, ATP-
citrate lyase, AcCoACx and FAS activities are elevated

with MCT but markedly depressed with LCT (Fig. 3, Table 4).Conversely, many authors (4,8,10) have shown that MCT-rich diets are much less effective in reducing the hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities than are LCT-
rich diets. However, rats fed MCT had higher lipogenic

enzyme activities than LF1 rats (Fig. 3). Similar obser vations for malic enzyme and FAS activities have been
recently reported (11). Moreover, our observations are consistent with high rates of lipogenesis observed in hepatocytes isolated from long-term MCT-fed rats incu
bated with oleate or octanoate in the presence of lactate plus pyruvate (33,34). Because the LF1 diet contains 4% corn oil whereas the MCT diet contains only 1% corn oil, a question arises as to whether the observed MCT diet effect is due to MCT or to inhibitory effects of corn oil included in the LF1 diet. This was addressed in Experiment 2, in which LF2 and MCT diets both con tained 1% corn oil.
Our results show that hepatic activities of lipogenic enzymes were similar in rats fed for 21 d with the LF2 and MCT diets (Table 4) or in rats fed for 21 d with the LF2 or MCT diets after previously being adapted to a LCT diet (Fig. 6). Our observations are consistent with similar increases in hepatic malic enzyme and FAS activities observed in starved rats refed with LF and MCT diets containing 1% corn oil (11). Furthermore, feeding an MCT diet to weaned rats does not prevent the normal increase (threefold) of both activity and mRNA synthesis of AcCoACx and FAS in adipose tissue (Girard, J., personal communication). Thus, MCT per se have neither an inhibitory nor a stimulatory effect on liver activities of lipogenic enzymes,- these effects de
pend on the linoleic acid and carbohydrate content, respectively, of MCT diets.
High fat diets have been reported to stimulate gluco-
neogenesis (35), and high MCT or LCT diets have been shown (8) to increase PEPCK activity in rats. However, in Experiment 1, hepatic PEPCK activity did not change with the MCT diet or increase (1.6-fold) with the LCT
diet compared with the LF1 diet (Fig. 3). This discrep ancy suggests that in some way an excessive LCT intake may be related to an increase in PEPCK activity. Gener ally, an increase in liver PEPCK activity and synthesis is associated with a decrease in the insulin:glucagon molar ratio and an increase in liver cyclic AMP (36). However, as shown by others, no significant changes in insulin:glucagon molar ratio (8) or hepatic cyclic AMP (35,37) were found after feeding high levels of LCT. This suggests that another mechanism could be involved. Such a mechanism could involve thyroid hormones. Recent studies indicate (38, 39) that thyroid hormones can also increase the synthesis of PEPCK. Moreover, thyroxine treatments of fed rats decreased liver glycogen concentration and increased the rate of gluconeogenesis in the perfused fat liver (40, 41) or in intact rats (42). In keeping with that, our results show (Experiments 1 and 2) that hepatic glycogen concentration was significantly lower in rats fed the LCT diet than in those fed LF1, LF2 or MCT diets. Further study is needed to explore this hypothesis.
The present data (Fig. 4â"6a)lso show that the shift
from a LCT diet to a MCT diet induced biphasic adapta

tive changes. First, a decrease in food intake resulted in a decrease in weight gain and plasma insulin concentra tion and an increase in blood ketone body concentra tions, which was probably related to a high peripheral lipolysis that resulted in high hepatic FFA oxidation. Second, food intake was overshot, resulting in an in crease in weight gain; blood ketone body levels were maintained, but the plasma insulin concentration re turned to the LF2 level. During this phase, high blood ketone body concentrations may be related to the high MCT diet intake. However, in neither phase did the ketonemia exceed the physiological limits (300 (j.mol/L). This may be attributable to the high level of carbohydrate supplied by the MCT diet. The adaptation phase seems to end 21 d after initiation of the MCT diet, because all parameters studied were constant and sim ilar to those observed in rats fed the LF2 diet.
In conclusion, this study shows that in rats, long-
term consumption of a diet in which MCT constitutes 30% of metabolizable energy did not change energy intake, body weight gain, energy and nitrogen retention, or lipid deposition. Moreover, no alteration in hepatic metabolites or in both blood and hepatic ketone body concentrations was observed. This is probably due to the high carbohydrate level (50% of metabolizable en ergy) in the MCT diet used in the present study. In addition, a high activity in the hepatic lipogenic en zymes was observed, showing that MCT per se had no inhibitory effect on the activity of these enzymes. These observations suggest an adaptation of the rat to the long-term consumption of such a diet containing MCT
at a level not reached in human feeding.
