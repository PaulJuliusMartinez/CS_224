Strain-induced alignment in elastic collagen gels

Abstract

Collagen is the most abundant extra-cellular-network-forming protein in animal biology
and is important in both natural and artiﬁcial tissues where it serves as a material of great
mechanical versatility. Much of this versatility arises from its almost unique ability to remodel
under applied loads into anisotropic and inhomogeneous structures. We explore the origins of
this versatility by probing the mechanical response of ﬁbrous collagenous networks in a load
cell that mimics the typical deformation proﬁle imposed by cells in vivo. We observe strong
ﬁber alignment and densiﬁcation as a function of applied strain for both uncrosslinked and
crosslinked networks. This alignment is found to be irreversibly imprinted in uncrosslinked
collagen networks, and suggests a simple mechanism for tissue organization at the microscale.
However, this behaviour becomes reversible when the ﬁber binding strength is increased by
addition of a crosslinker, indicating that these eﬀects are primarily elastic, and part of the
fundamental non-linear properties of ﬁbrous biological networks.

Introduction

Fiber networks, which arise in a range of natural and technological situations, are prime candidates
for a wide spectrum of applications [1] requiring a range of mechanical, transport and chemical
properties that are easily tunable by changing their geometry, density, connectivity and order. In
nature, these networks self-assemble to generate important structural and functional elements at
various length scales: actin, intermediate ﬁlaments and microtubules are the main components of
the cytoskeleton [2]; spectrin confers versatile qualities to red blood cell membranes [3]; ﬁbrin is
an essential element in hemostasis [4]; collagen is the major component of the extracellular matrix
(ECM) [5] in the animal kingdom and cellulose is used by plants to build cell walls.

The mechanical function of biological ﬁber networks is essentially two-fold: (i) at the subcellular
(actin, spectrin) and supracellular (collagen, ﬁbrin) scales, the material oﬀers little resistance and
high sensitivity to small deformations, while it stiﬀens at larger strains to ensure cell and tissue
integrity [6]; (ii) at the mesoscale, these networks are also a means of transmitting and amplifying
forces over larger length scales, such as when molecular motors inside a single cell transmit forces
through the network onto focal adhesions and integrins during cell motility [7], or when cells in
a tissue equivalent (TE) [8] generate signiﬁcant tensile forces of the order of 10nN [9, 10], lead-
ing eventually to the contraction of the ECM [11].
In this class of latter examples where cells
remodel their environment, the structural and mechanical state of the ECM also inﬂuences the
physiological behaviour of cells such as polarity and motility, leading to complex tissue organization
[12, 13, 14, 15] which often shows strong local anisotropy resulting from cell polarization and ﬁber
alignment. Indeed this allows for the speciﬁc control of tissue mechanical properties in such cases as
artery walls [16] where this anisotropy is crucial for normal function. Recent attempts to engineer
functional tissue [17] focus on the role of an external perturbation upon polymerization to generate
oriented structures by trying to mimic in vivo processes which involve the mechanical behaviour

of cells embedded in it, post polymerization [18]. However, the structural origins of the alignment
in cell-populated tissues is subtle in that it depends on the boundary conditions and the strong
stress heterogeneities around each cell in the network, neither of which can be easily extrapolated
from measurements of global shearing or stretching. An understanding of in vivo or in vitro tissue
morphogenesis, a precursor to the rational engineering of tissues, therefore requires that we disen-
tangle intrinsic cell behaviour (mechano-sensation and force generation) from the purely mechanical
aspects speciﬁc to the underlying network.

Before proceeding towards this goal, in ﬁgure 1 we show how the contractile activity of cells
embedded in a TE and its eﬀect on the collagen network is illustrated at several length scales. A
single cell (a) has the ability to pull on ﬁbers, resulting in local variation of the network density
and signiﬁcant ﬁber alignment [11]; this eﬀect is enhanced when the cell is polarized and oriented.
Multiple cells tend to polarize in the same direction when sparsely plated in the network, illustrating
their ability to sense their mechanical environment and to orient in the direction of higher stiﬀness
[14]; they can thus produce a higher level of network organization (b), each individual cell interacting
with its nearest neighbours. While performing experimental tests on much larger assemblies, such
as two cellular colonies or spheroids, we observed an ampliﬁcation of this material densiﬁcation
and alignment, and a strong attraction of motile cells toward this region, which suggests that
large-scale ﬁber alignment is predominantly driven by the collagen matrix. However, working with
live cells prevents a complete analysis of the purely mechanical processes at work; in particular
understanding how morphological changes associated with ﬁber bundling and alignment arise is
diﬃcult in the presence of live cells that do not have ”robust” behaviours. Indeed, while live cell
cultures impose a controlled and constant chemical environment, they have a limited range of time
scales over which they pull on the network, resulting in large uncertainties on the deformation and
stress they produce. This is compounded by the fact that cells are known to degrade the ECM
enzymatically, as well as secrete their own ECM [19]. While all these aﬀects are undoubtedly
important in biological tissues, here we use a minimal system using a purely mechanical device
to mimic the deformation seen when two groups of cells generate localized tensile forces on the
network, and use this system to understand the minimal requirements for strain-induced alignment
in ﬁbrous networks.

Experimental approach

We focus on purely geometrical measurements characterized by the evolution of ﬁber alignment
on local stretching, and thus avoid any considerations of the corresponding forces and stresses.
This makes our results independent of the speciﬁc mechanical properties of both the ﬁber and the
network, and allows us to generalize our results to a broad range of networks. However, for experi-
mental ease, we focus on collagenous systems, which oﬀer many practical advantages in addition to
being broadly relevant for tissue engineering. These advantages include a) an extensive knowledge
of collagen’s properties [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]; b) the large diameter of the ﬁbers (typically 0.5µm
[26]) and the stability of the network [27, 28], which make it easy to handle and image over a
range of spatial and temporal scales, compared to say, actin networks; c) sample preparation for
ﬁbrillogenesis is conveniently controlled in vitro by pH, temperature and concentration [22, 25].

The range of collagen concentrations we work with (0.5-4.0 mg/mL) display mesh sizes ranging
from 1-5 µm and span over two orders of magnitude in shear modulus, with an onset of non-linear
elasticity typically occurring at strains of the order of 10% for a broad range of deformation modes
[22, 29]. Our experimental procedure consists of placing a polymerized sample onto a glass cover
slip and perforating it with two rigid rods (see ﬁgure 2) which are gently pushed all the way to
the glass bottom to prevent the collagen from slipping beneath them. The rods, initially 1cm from
each other, are then moved apart using linear motors at speeds ranging from 0.125 to 12.5 µm/s,
corresponding to strain rates of 2.5·10−5 to 2.5·10−3 per second; this range includes measured rates
of cell-induced contraction [30]. The movement of the rods results in the local stretching of the
gel between them. Acquisition of confocal reﬂectance laser scanning microscopy (CRLSM) images
allows us to extract the statistics of ﬁber orientation in the central region of the sample, away from
the boundaries where the eﬀects of the localized deformation may not be neglected. We characterize
the direction of each ﬁber projected in the xy plane by the angle φ with the y axis (see Materials and
Methods). We limit ourselves to a characterization of the in-plane properties of the network, since
the procedure of laying down the material onto the cover slip yields a system that is anisotropic
perpendicular to the cover slip, as we discuss later. To quantify network anisotropy as a function of
the applied deformation, we calculate an orientation tensor Ω and nematic order parameter µ from
the distribution of the ﬁber orientation φ at each time step, deﬁned by

Ω = (cid:18)

hcos(φ) sin(φ)i

hcos2(φ)i

hcos(φ) sin(φ)i

µ = Max {Eigenvalues(2 Ω − Id)}

(cid:10)sin2(φ)(cid:11)

(cid:19)

We see that the order parameter ranges from µ = 0 for a uniform angular (isotropic) distribution
to µ = 1 for a perfectly aligned system. Since the ﬁbers also deform as they are aligned, we also
determine the mesoscopic deformation ﬁeld induced by the externally applied displacement of the
glass rods. Using image cross-correlation of ﬂuorescent particles that are permanently attached to
the gel allows us to determine the local strains in the horizontal plane εxx and εyy, while confocal
imaging of multiple slices along the vertical axis provides an estimate of the deformation εzz along
that axis (see Materials and Methods). These geometric measurements allow us to determine
the incremental Poisson ratio νxy = −∂εyy/∂εxx, which characterizes the incremental coupling of
deformations in orthogonal directions. Taken together, these measurements enable us to determine
the evolution of both the local displacement ﬁeld and the microstructure of the ﬁbrous network as
a function of the applied deformation, and for a representative experiment are shown in ﬁgure 3.

Orientational ordering is primarily an elastic eﬀect

At low strains (< 10%), the confocal microscopy images of the collagen network shown in ﬁg 3a,b
as it is being stretched show no particular alignment; however, there is clear alignment as well as
increased ﬁber volume fraction at higher strains along the axis of the applied displacement. Away
from this axis, both ﬁber alignment and ﬁber density (expressed as fraction of pixels above a given
threshold) decrease (ﬁg 2). This is in agreement with observations of the alignment induced by cell
colonies pulling on extra-cellular matrix shown in ﬁgure 1, where ﬁber alignment and density are
maximum along the axis joining the colonies, and decay away from it.

In ﬁgure 3c we show the components of the induced strain εyy and εzz as a function of the
externally applied strain εxx. When εxx ≤ 2% there is little or no signiﬁcant contraction in the
transverse direction so that the Poisson ratio νxy ∼0. As the applied strain increases, the material
ﬁrst thins by contracting in the z direction when 2% ≤ εxx ≤ 5%, and only when εxx ≥ 5% does it
also contract in the transverse y direction, with a Poisson ratio which can be quite large, νxy ∼ 5.
The lag in response between these two directions is due to the sample geometry as well as a slight
initial anisotropy of ﬁber orientations in the yz plane [26]; here we consider only the properties of
the planar projection of the network. The large in-plane incremental Poisson ratio νxy quantiﬁes
the change in local ﬁber density and conﬁrms the qualitative observations of an increase of the
density obtained using confocal imaging. In ﬁgures 3d and 3e, we show the probability distribution
of local in-plane ﬁber orientation and the resulting order parameter, as a function of the applied

4

strain. When εxx ≤ 5%, the ﬁber distribution reﬂects the minor anisotropy usually seen in a random
polymerized network but does not evolve; during this phase, the sample becomes slightly thinner.
The slight initial anisotropy noticable on the histograms is random in its orientation and seems
to result from the preparation itself: this bias has no inﬂuence on the response at larger scale.
As the strain increases beyond 5%, the ﬁbers progressively align with the direction of the applied
displacement.

from the data in (d); the curve beyond 15% stretch is greyed out due to the lack of conﬁdence of
the order parameter when the high value of the density prevents a proper detection of the ﬁbers
(see Materials and Methods). Movies showing ﬁbre alignment and wide-ﬁeld ﬂuorescence images
are available as supplementary online material.

Strain-induced alignment arises due to a combination of reversible elastic eﬀects and irreversible
inelastic eﬀects. All pure type-I collagen samples display very little reversibility regardless of their
concentration once the imposed deformations exceed about 10%; the gel never recovers its initial
conﬁguration once the external displacements are relaxed. This can be seen in ﬁgure 4 by following
the evolution of the ﬁber orientation histograms as the material is stretched up to strains of ∼15%
and released, wherein the applied strain is permanently imprinted. To contrast this irreversible de-
formation with a possible reversible mechanism for orientational ordering, we added glutaraldehyde

(GA) - a common cell and tissue ﬁxative - to the collagen samples post polymerization (see Materials
and Methods). This crosslinks the ﬁbers without changing any of the basic geometrical parameters
(ﬁber width and length, mesh size) in the problem. When moving through a cycle of applying and

6

then relaxing the external displacement ﬁeld for the GA crosslinked sample, ﬁgures 4c-e show that
the material exhibits near-reversibility at the microscale, with ﬁber images of successive cycles being
almost identical. Figures 4f and 4g quantify this reversibility in terms of the orientation histogram
and the order parameter over multiple deformation cycles. Consistent with this behaviour, at the
mesoscale we can track the deformation of the gel and ﬁnd that the local deformation ﬁelds evolve
along a reversible path; the bold line (loading) and dashed line (unloading) on ﬁgure 4 show this
for the same strain rate as previously. Taken together, these results show that ﬁber plasticity is
neither involved in the alignment process, nor in the corresponding Poisson eﬀect at larger scales,
i.e. strain-induced alignment is primarily an elastic eﬀect.

The establishment of a reversible mechanism for alignment serves as a baseline for the eﬀect of
inelastic and dynamical processes which are of importance in other situations. For example, we see
that there is a slight decrease in the amplitude of the alignment with the number of cycles, which is
conﬁrmed independently by using the mesoscopic deformation ﬁeld as shown in ﬁgure 4g; an eﬀect
possibly due to the slow rupture of bonds under these large-strain cycles. In ﬁgure 4h we show
the eﬀects of strain rate on the response of the system, for a ﬁxed displacement amplitude. At
lower strain rates, although the response of the system is close to being reversible, the system does
not recover completely after a full cycle. This oﬀset in the response can be attributed to a slow
creeping process occurring over a time scale of a few hours. At larger strain rates, one expects to
see dynamic eﬀects related to viscous dissipation. Imposing a fast step-like deformation, we found
that the system equilibrates on time scales of the order of a minute, consistent with previous work
on the poroelasticity of collagen networks [31]. However, larger rates inﬂuence the unloading curve
more than the loading curve, which suggests that the material responds with diﬀerent time-scales
in extension and compression; this is probably due to the fact that the relaxation of the gel can
be delayed because of the slow dynamics of ﬁber bending relative to the rapid dynamics of ﬁber
stretching.

Discussion

Functional tissues, which are often made of ﬁbrous elements, are both anisotropic and inhomoge-
neous. This raises the question of how nature is able to engineer such structural materials. Here we
have shown a plausible pathway for how this might be brought about by applying deformation with
a purely mechanical device which causes the network to develop a texture similar to that generated
by cells in an in vitro assay. Our results quantify observations of collagen orientational ordering in
in vitro gels [26], as well as recent measurements on macroscopic ﬁbrous systems such as felt [32] and
show that tissue anisotropy in our system arises solely from the externally applied displacements
without any involvement from the active remodeling due to living cells. Moreover, the reversibility
of the ﬁber alignment and gel densiﬁcation seen in GA-crosslinked collagen gels indicates that this
orientational ordering of the material is primarily an elastic eﬀect, even if ﬁber plasticity eventually
sets in. An important feature of this behaviour is the high value of the incremental Poisson ratio
obtained for deformations larger than 10%, which is a natural consequence of the softness of the
ﬁbers in compression relative to their behaviour in tension. Indeed, these two eﬀects are coupled
in our system, where the softness in compressive behaviour at the micro-scale leads to alignment of
the ﬁbers along direction of the applied displacement.

This type of primarily extensional deformation that is accompanied by large changes in dilata-
tional (volumetric) strain should be relevant broadly across biology and rheology but has been often
neglected due to the nature of the rheometric devices typically used to characterize soft materials

7

that almost always impose isochoric deformations and rates thereof. Even in extensionally domi-
nated deformations, our work emphasizes the importance of boundary conditions. Most previous
work (see [33] for a recent example) involves samples mounted between two gauges whose size was
of the same order of the distance between them, so that the network is therefore under tension
in all directions. Indeed, this leads to negative normal stresses in simple shear experiments [34].
This must be contrasted with our studies that were designed to prevent biaxially stressed states
and ensure stress-free boundary conditions on the lateral sides, similar to earlier experiments on a
macroscopic piece of felt [32]. In both these situations, an important eﬀect was that ﬁber buckling
in the direction normal to the applied displacement leads to large lateral contraction and consequent
ordering. More generally the external control of ﬁber alignment post polymerization oﬀers a conve-
nient way to design anisotropic tissue equivalents, and also sheds light on a range of other analogous
phenomena, such as actin gel contraction [35] or platelet-ﬁbrin interactions [36], where microscopic
agents interact through the network and lead to large scale evolution and reorganization of matter.

Materials and methods

Network synthesis

A previously described [37] cell culture-compatible preparation protocol is used to generate in vitro
collagen networks with a ﬁnal collagen concentration ranging from 0.5 to 4.0mg/mL. Brieﬂy, solu-
tions consist of 10% 10X minimum essential medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10% fetal bovine
serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), bovine collagen di-
luted to desired concentration (from 3.1mg/mL or 10mg/mL batch, Inamed Biomaterials, Fremont,
CA), a few µL of 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to bring pH to neutral,
50mM sodium bicarbonate (N aHCO3, Sigma) buﬀer and deionized water. 800µL of solution are
pipetted onto glass-bottom Petri dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) Samples then polymerize for 30-
60 minutes in a cell incubator at 37 degrees Celsius, 5% CO2. After polymerization, samples are
roughly 20mm in diameter and 1-2mm in height.

Crosslinking with glutaraldehyde is performed after polymerization. 2mL of 4% v/v GA (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) in water is pipetted onto the sample, which is then incubated once more for at least
2 hours. It is subsequently rinsed twice with deionized water. Before imaging and stretching, all
samples are immersed into 2mL of deionized water, to allow the gel to swell, to reduce friction and
gravity eﬀects.

Mechanical and optical setup

To stretch the samples, we use two rough-ended 1mm-diameter glass cylinders (capillaries). Each
cylinder is attached to two secondary transverse elastic rods, themselves attached to two linear
transducers (Newport, Irvine, CA) controlled by the ESP300 controller (Newport). The deﬂection
of the secondary rods allows the tips to maintain contact with the bottom cover slip of the dish, and
ensures some control of the applied pressure. For confocal and wide-ﬁeld microscopy, we place the
motors and tips onto platforms (built-in or custom-made, respectively) attached to the microscope
sample holder plate, to ensure synchronous motion of the tips with the sample.

Confocal imaging

We use a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with
a 488nm Argon laser line and several photomutliplier tubes. We set the Meta channel of the
microscope (which allows for selection of speciﬁc wavelengths) to detect wavelengths between 474
and 494nm; this range need only include 488nm in it, since we are working in reﬂectance. A 60X
1.2-NA Olympus (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA) water immersion objective is mounted
onto the microscope.

While deforming the sample, we acquire timelapse 2D confocal images at various heights between
50 and 150µm from the bottom surface. Following more than one slice over time allows us to estimate
the vertical deformation of the sample (ﬁg 5). The timelapse interval is 10s, which corresponds to
0.25% imposed deformation at the typical strain rate.

Fiber orientation is calculated on each 2D confocal slice by several image processing steps: the
raw images are ﬁltered using a 2D Gaussian blur and subsequently thresholded so that at 0%
stretch, 10% of the pixels are above that threshold; this threshold value is applied to all subsequent
images of the same experiment. A circular window of diameter 15px moves across the thresholded
image, and calculates the 2nd order moment tensor Mloc locally using binary pixel weights: below
the threshold level, the pixel weight Aij is 0, above that level it is 1.

Mloc = (cid:18)

P(Aij(Xij − Xavg)2)

P(Aij(X(ij) − Xavg)(Yij − Yavg))

P(Aij(Yij − Yavg)2)

The ratio r is directly correlated with the aspect ratio of binarized network fragment enclosed in
the sliding window: a single ﬁber passing through the middle of the window, with a diameter less
than half the window size will yield a high aspect ratio; a single ﬁber in the corner of the window
will give a low aspect ratio; multiple ﬁbers in the window will also give a low aspect ratio. We keep
only those pixels with r > 2; for those valid pixels, the eigenvector corresponding to the higher
eigenvalue of Mloc gives the local orientation.

It must be noted that the local orientation analysis, as described, gives unreliable results for high
density images - typically, where the fraction of pixels higher than the set threshold is above 0.5. At
high stretch, the ﬁber volume fraction is larger and many of the calculated aspect ratios are below
2 because there is more than one ﬁber in each sliding window; much noise and artefacts are thus
introduced in the measurement of angular histograms and order parameter, at high densities and
high stretch. As a consequence, the angle histograms and order parameter are considered invalid at
densities higher than 0.5. The choice of window size (15 pixels) is a compromise between increasing
angular resolution at low strains and avoiding multiple ﬁbers in a window at high strains.

Vertical strain can be estimated by correlating each slice of each stretching time series with each
slice of the next time point. By ﬁnding the best-matching slice for several initial slices at a given
time point, one can estimate the distance between them and compare it to the undeformed state,
thus obtaining an approximate value for the vertical strain.

Deformation ﬁeld at the mesoscale

1µm diameter rhodamine Fluospheres (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), at a volume ratio of 1:100000,
are used as tracers to measure the deformation of the gel at millimeter lengthscales. Most of the
carboxy-coated particles stick to the network, as seen on ﬁgure 5. Using a 5x lens on a Zeiss

wide-ﬁeld microscope and focusing in the middle of the sample, we image the local density of these
particles, which presents heterogeneities at the scale of 10 to 50 µm. We use image correlation
techniques to track these heterogeneities as the network is progressively deformed. To identify the
local displacement of a point P1 of the matrix, located at (x1, y1), from time t1 to t2, we extract a
box of 48x48 pixels surrounding P1 at t1 and search for the best matching region in the ﬂuorescence
image measured at t2, over a region of size 64x64. This process is iterated over time to extract the
full trajectory of the point. The local deformation is obtained by using a grid of points (typically
8x8) tracked independently: this leads to a map of the deformation ﬁeld in the horizontal plane.
As the deformation is, to a good approximation, aﬃne and homogeneous at the scale of 100 µm, we
use a least-square planar ﬁt of the displacements grid to evaluate the local value of the deformation
ﬁeld, averaged typically at the millimeter scale. The deviation from this least-square ﬁt gives a
measure of the error on the deformation ﬁeld.
