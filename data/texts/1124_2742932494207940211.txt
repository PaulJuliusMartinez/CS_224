Measurement Geometries
Fig. 3-16. A ray of light striking a translucent material will lead to reflection, transmission, and absorption. Reflection can be either regular, diffuse, or retro. Transmission can be either regular or diffuse. Light that is neither reflected nor transmitted is absorbed.

Fig. 3-17. Here are three indicatrices showing the differences between the diffuse, specular, and retroreflecting properties of different materials.

Fig. 3-18. These spheres were drawn using a computer graphics model(Phong 1975) that assumes that the specular portion of an indicatrix is a Gaussian distribution with adjustable width, similar to the above indicatrices.

Fig. 3-21. By having the illumination angle between 6 and 8 , the specular reflection of a specimen can be excluded by placing a black trap at the specular port or can be included by placing at that port a plaque with identical properties to those of the sphere's interior.
Page

Fig. 3-22. Here we superimpose an indicatrix for a semiglossy material and an integrating sphere along with its specular port. When instruments with different size specular ports measure this material, the measured values are different, caused by different amounts of the specular reflection being excluded from each measurement. Neither instrument completely eliminates the specular component.

 Choosing a CIE geometry-reflectance
­ The various geometric
· Diffuse illumination and 8 viewing with the specular component included (d/8:i)
- Corresponding to completely diffuse illumination in which any specular reflection and texture would not be obserable
· Diffuse illumination and 8 viewing with the specular component excluded (d/8:e)
- Corresponding to completely diffuse illuminatio, but specular reflection is excluded
· Circumferential 45 illumination and normal viewing (45/0:c)
Page

Fig. 3-23. A semigloss tile is measured using d/8:I(red dotted line), d/8:e(green dashed line), and 45/d(blue solid line) gemetries. The color differences between d/8:I and d/8:e and between d/8:I and 45/0 are compared. Clearly, geometry has a dramatic affect on the estimated color of a specimen.

Fig. 3-24. Depending on the position of the sample and the use of a white tile or black trap at the sample port, it is straightforward to measure regular, diffuse, and total transmittance using an integrating sphere.

 Multiangle geometry
­ The three dominant color
· Near-specular
- Observation of viewing a sample very close to the specular angle - Influence the metallic flak or interference pigment
· Face
- Observation of viewing a sample at a conventional diffuse angle such as along the normal for 45 illumination
- Influence the conventional colorants
· Flop color
- Observation of viewing a sample in the opposite direction from the specular angle
- Influence both conventional pigments and metallic flak or interference pigment

­ The angle
· Aspecular angle
- Viewing angle measured from the specular direction
· Near-aspecular angle
- The aspecular angle when a material is viewed from a direction very close to the specular, typically with 25
· Face angle
- The aspecular angle when a specimen is viewed close to its surface normal and illuminated near 45 , or when the angle of illumination and viewing are interchanged
· Flop color angle
- The aspecular angle when a material is viewed from a direction far from the specular, typically with 70 or more

 Spectrophotometers
­ Measurement the reflectance form or the transmittance through materials as a function of wavelength
­ Using of source the spectral characteristics of D65 between 300 and 780nm
­ Reflection
· The process by which radiant energy is returned from a material or object
­ Reflectance factor
· The ratio of the flux reflected from the specimen to the flux reflected from the perfect reflecting diffuser under the same geometric and spectral conditions of measurement
­ Transmittance
· The ratio of transmitted flux to incident flux, under specified geometric and spectral conditions

Fig. 3-32. A measurement recorded at a given wavelength is actually based on light collected over a range of wavelengths, evenly weighted about the given wavelength. Bandwidth defines the half-width of this weighted average. In this example, the bandwidth is defined as 10nm triangular.
