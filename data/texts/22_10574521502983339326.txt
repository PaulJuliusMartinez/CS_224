IMPACT OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
z Achievement of human-level machine intelligence will have a profound impact on modern society--a society which is driven by a quest for efficiency, convenience and enhancement of quality of life.

z Human-level machine intelligence is likely to play a pivotal role in mechanization of natural language understanding, search, decision-making, planning, control and, more particularly, in information reuse and integration.

TURING TEST (1947)

z The Turing test is intended to differentiate between a human and a machine. There is an extensive literature.

z My contention is that Turing test is unnecessary. No machine can pass the following test. I talk for a few minutes and ask the machine to summarize what I said.

THE CURSE OF EFFICIENCY
z Far too often, we have to struggle with a dumb automated customer service system which we are forced to use. Such experiences make us keenly aware that human-level machine intelligence is an objective rather than reality.

z When human-level machine intelligence is achieved, we will not be able to tell the difference between an automated customer service system and one which is not.

TEST: DEDUCTIVE CAPABILITY

z Existing search engines have many remarkable capabilities. But a capability which they do not have is deduction capability, that is, the capability to synthesize an answer to a query by drawing on information contained in various web pages. As an illustration, Google--the most advanced search engine--cannot come up with an answer to the simple query: Population of Obama's birthplace?

CONTENTION
z Achievement of human-level machine intelligence is beyond the reach of theories based on classical, Aristotelian, bivalent logic.

z The centerpiece of bivalent logic is the

principle of the excluded middle: every

proposition is either true or false, with no

shades of truth allowed. The problem is that

this principle is not a good fit to the real

world--a world in which imprecision,

uncertainty and partiality of truth are

pervasive phenomena.

WHAT CAN BE DONE?
z What can be done to advance our ability to achieve human-level machine intelligence?
z Add new tools to the armamentarium of AI

1. Employ soft computing

2. FL-generalization. Upgrade bivalent-logic-based methods through addition with concepts and techniques drawn from fuzzy logic

Example: Probability theory

SOFT COMPUTING (BISC 1991)
z Soft computing is a coalition of methodologies which collectively serve as a platform for the conception, design, construction and operation of intelligent systems.

z The four cornerstones of soft computing are (1) fuzzy logic; (2) neurocomputing; (3) evolutionary computing; and (4) probabilistic computing. The guiding principal of soft computing is: To achieve superior performance employ the constituent methodologies of soft computing in combination rather than in a stand-alone mode. Examples: neurofuzzy, neurogenetic, neuro-fuzzy-genetic. Such combinations are in wide use in consumer products, industrial control and fraud detection.

13 /90

LAZ 2/15/2008

z The genesis of soft computing has an important side-effect; it stimulates inclusion of courses on soft computing engineering curricula, and thereby enlarges the cadre of engineers trained in applying soft computing to the design and construction of high-performance intelligent systems.

COMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF PERCEPTIONS (ZADEH 2001)

z Humans have a remarkable capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks, e.g., driving a car in heavy city traffic, without any measurements and any computations.
z In my 2001 paper "A new direction in AI--toward a computational theory of perceptions," published in AI Magazine, I argued that mechanization of this remarkable capability is beyond the reach of methods based on bivalent logic. What is needed is bivalent-logic-based computational theory of perceptions. In this theory, the objects of computation are not perceptions per se but their descriptions in a natural language.

NEED FOR FUZZY LOGIC AS A BASIS FOR HUMAN-LEVEL MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

z Achievement of human-level machine intelligence require mechanization of two remarkable human capabilities.

z The capability to reason and make decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information and partiality of truth.

z The capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks based on perceptions, without any measurements and any computations. Example: driving a car in city traffic.

z A nontraditional view of fuzzy logic serves this

purpose.

FUZZY LOGIC MINUS MISCONCEPTIONS

z There are many misconceptions about fuzzy logic. To begin with, fuzzy logic is not fuzzy. Basically, fuzzy logic is a precise logic of imprecision and approximate reasoning.
z Paradoxically, one of the principal contributions of fuzzy logic is its high power of precisiation.
z Example: The meaning of "Speed limit is 65 mph" can be precisiated more closely through the use of fuzzy logic than through the use of bivalent logic.

18 /90

LAZ 2/15/2008

CONTINUED

z Another source of confusion is the duality of meaning of fuzzy logic. In a narrow sense, fuzzy logic is a logical system which is a generalization of multivalued logic.

z In a wide sense, which is in dominant use today, fuzzy logic, FL, is much more than a logical system. FL has many facets. The principal facets are: the logical facet, FLl; the fuzzy set theoretic facet, FLs, the epistemic facet, Fle; and the relational facet, FLr.

z The basic concepts of graduation and granulation form the core of FL and are the principal distinguishing features of fuzzy logic. More specifically, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be graduated, that is, be a matter of degree or, equivalently, fuzzy.

21 /90

LAZ 2/15/2008

z Furthermore, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be granulated, with a granule being a clump of attribute-values drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity or functionality. Graduated granulation, or equivalently fuzzy granulation, is a unique feature of fuzzy logic. Graduated granulation is inspired by the way in which humans deal with complexity and imprecision.

A BIT OF HISTORY
z Today, the concept of a linguistic variable is used in almost all applications of fuzzy logic. When I introduced this concept in my 1973 paper "Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes," I was greeted with scorn and derision rather than with accolades. Here is an expert from a comment by R. Kalman, a brilliant scientist.

LAZ 2/15/2008

CONTINUED
R.E. Kalman (1972)
I would like to comment briefly on Professor Zadeh's presentation. His proposals could be severely, ferociously, even brutally criticized from a technical point of view. This would be out of place here. But a blunt question remains: Is Professor Zadeh presenting important ideas or is he indulging in wishful thinking?

26 /90

LAZ 2/15/2008

CONTINUED
No doubt Professor Zadeh's enthusiasm for fuzziness has been reinforced by the prevailing climate in the U.S.--one of unprecedented permissiveness. "Fuzzification" is a kind of scientific pervasiveness; it tends to result in socially appealing slogans unaccompanied by the discipline of hard scientific work and patient observation.

27 /90

LAZ 2/15/2008

CONTINUED
z The derisive comments reflected a deep-seated tradition in science--a tradition of according much more respect to numbers than to words. Thus, in science progress is equated to progression from words to numbers.

LAZ 2/15/2008

CONTINUED
z In fuzzy logic, in moving from numerical to linguistic variables, we are moving in a counter traditional direction. What the critics did not understand is that in moving in the countertraditional direction, we are sacrificing precision to achieve important advantages down the line. This is what is called "The fuzzy logic gambit."

z A concept which plays a key role in fuzzy logic is the concept of granular value.

z As was noted earlier, the problem of mechanization of natural language understanding has a position of centrality in machine intelligence. It plays a particularly important role in representation of world knowledge, assessment of relevance, summarization, search, question-answering, assessment of risk and decision-making. To compute with information described in natural language, it is necessary to precisiate meaning. The issue of precisiation is discussed in the following.

LAZ 2/15/2008

RATIONALE 1

z Use of fuzzy logic greatly enlarges the number and variety of ways in which the value of vimprecise variable or a system of v-imprecise variables may be described and mmprecisiated.

z One of the principal contributions of fuzzy logic is its high power of mm-precisiation. A concomitant of high power of mm-precisiation is high ability of fuzzy logic to serve as modeling language for complex, real-world systems.

z Historical note: my 1965 paper on fuzzy sets was motivated by Rationale 1.

LAZ 2/15/2008

RATIONALE 2

z Assumption: there is a tolerance for vimprecision. Precision carries a cost. To exploit the tolerance for imprecision, vimprecisiate the variable or a system of variables, reducing Case 2 to Case 1.

We achieve mm-precision by translation of natural language into a precisiation language.

(S, P, M(S,P), Sol(P, M(S))

system problem model solution

z If a cointensive, mm-precisiable model of S can be constricted, then P has a p-valid solution
z If a cointensive mm-precisiable model of S cannot be constructed, then it is not possible to construct a pvalid solution of P.
z The alternative is an f-valid solution

AN IMPORTANT CONCLUSION
z In many real-world settings, an f-valid solution based on a realistic model may be better than a p-valid solution based on an unrealistic model.

SUMMATION

z Achievement of human-level machine intelligence has profound implications for modern society and, more particularly, for science and technology

z A view which is articulated in our

presentation is that human-level machine

intelligence cannot be achieved through the

use of theories based on bivalent logic. It is

argued that to achieve human-level machine

intelligence it is necessary to upgrade

existing theories through addition of

concepts and techniques drawn from fuzzy

logic.
