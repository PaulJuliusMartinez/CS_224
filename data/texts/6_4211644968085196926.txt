Abstract

Hexagonal dot packing seems to offer beneﬁts for halftone
printing compared to conventional square dot packing, but
little practical experience has been reported. Taking advan-
tage of recent reﬁnements in digital electrophotographic
(EP) printer technology, the authors conducted experiments
on a commercially deployable system to assess whether the
potential advantages of hexagonal dot packing are econom-
ically exploitable.

Keywords: hexagonal, halftone, spot function, spectrogram

Introduction

Digital printing has nearly always been accomplished by
round dots organized on rectangular grids. It is understood
that the improved packing efﬁciency of hexagonal grids for
round dots would be more easily achieved than rectangular
dots for rectangular grids, but evidently neither hexagonal
grids nor rectangular dots have generally been considered
worthwhile.

Ulichney [1] addressed halftone theory for hexagonal
grids. Average dot overlap can be reduced, since smaller
dots can ensure 100 percent coverage for the same dot fre-
quency. In addition, as Harrington [2] noted, each dot has
only six instead of eight dots with which to overlap, which
should simplify halftone pattern analysis.

This report compares some halftones for hexagonal dot
packing with comparable screens for square dot packing
and demonstrates some implications for image quality, tone
reproduction and halftone formation patterns. Two hy-
potheses are investigated for hexagonal dot packing:

(cid:15) gray levels are more usefully distributed for the same
(cid:15) important screen frequencies and angles concentrate

cluster size;

less visually perceptible artifact energy.

An important effect in EP printers is that dots are mod-
ulated by the proximity of other dots. Results will be an-
alyzed for whether this proximity effect is exacerbated or
attenuated by having all overlapping dots more equidistant.
The greater interdependency of dots in the same raster line

compared to dots on adjacent raster lines can be a con-
founding effect.

Hexagonal packing was implemented on the test printer
by shifting the dot centers in alternate raster lines by half
of the dot spacing. In Ulichney’s terminology, the resulting
p
p
aspect ratio, (cid:11), was 1, while the ideal aspect ratio for round
dots would have been 2=
3. Neither optimizing
3 or 2
the dot shape and size for (cid:11) = 1 nor optimizing (cid:11) for the
given dot shape and size were investigated in this study.

Euclidean screen for square dot array

To create a basis for comparison, the printer was ﬁrst ex-
ercised using a conventional Euclidean spot function gen-
erated for a rectangular dot array, as in Figure 1. Since
the Euclidean halftone is well-known [3], interested read-
ers should be able to bridge from our analyses to others
with which they may be familiar.

At viewing distances typical for letters, dot clusters
large enough to closely approximate the ideal shapes for
the Euclidean spot function have a very apparent periodic
structure when printed at 600 dpi.

signed for square dot packing at about 42 percent requested cov-
erage.

Spectrograms allow easy correlation of periodic en-
ergy with location and are particularly useful when this
energy is not uniformly distributed [4]. However, even
though halftones were regularly periodic for the images in
this study, the two-dimensional FFT (Figure 2) still seems
to be relatively uninformative in comparison to spectro-
grams (Figure 3). Consequently, spectrograms were used
for halftone frequency analysis in this study.
Spectrogram analyses were performed on 256(cid:2)256
pixel gray images captured from a video camera and
StereoZoom 7 microscope. Unfortunately, this video cam-
era does not have ‘square’ pixels; at lowest magniﬁcation,
the camera captures an 8 mm square area in 413(cid:2)382 pix-
els. Since the 0 degree Euclidean spot function of Figure 1
has the same periodic structure in the vertical and horizon-
tal directions, its row and column spectrograms in Figure 3
are nearly identical, allowing for image aspect ratio.

The advantages of hexagonal packing should be greater

that halftone tiles for hexagonal packing were in phase with the

for small dot clusters associated with higher effective line
screens. Using a threshold array composed of multiple
small dot clusters, such as Lexmark’s PictureGrade, is one
technique for obtaining more gray levels while attenuating
low frequency energy. These analyses focused on single
cluster arrays that could be aggregated for real applications.
A threshold array designed for hexagonal dot packing will
generally need to tile without changing phase of raster line
shift and consequently needs to be an even number of raster
lines in height.

An important halftone metric is how usefully dis-
tributed are gray levels for the real printer with a given
number of dots in a cluster. It was anticipated that, since
hexagonal packing results in fewer immediate neighbors
to provoke EP dot size modulation, more light gray levels
should be available.

The next part of the experiment veriﬁed microcode for
packing dots in hexagonal array, which is nearly an act of
faith, since a half-dot offset is unobvious by direct obser-
vation of magniﬁed symmetric bitmap patterns. For ex-
ample, vertical lines printed with hexagonal dot packing
(alternate raster lines printed with one-half dot horizontal
offset) were indistinguishable from vertical lines printed
with square dot packing on the same mechanism. How-
ever, consider the bitmaps in Figure 4, of two mirror-image
vertical 50 percent checkerboards, each two pixels wide.
With hexagonal dot packing, one of the checkerboard pat-
terns is printed with a net one-half dot offset between adja-

cent dots, while the other has a net 1.5 dot offset between
adjacent dots. Through the magic of laser electrophoto-
graphic printer technology, the resulting prints (Figure 4)
are distinguishable from straight vertical lines to the un-
aided eye primarily in that the line with net 1.5 dot offsets
has reduced density. In fact, edge raggedness was compa-
rable for vertical straight lines printed with alternating one-
half horizontal dot offsets for hexagonal dot packing and
vertical lines printed with square dot packing.
ImageX-
pert [5] edge raggedness measurements for printed vertical
lines ranged from 0.010 to 0.023 mm, using the square dot
packing for which it was designed. Comparable measure-
ments using hexagonal dot packing ranged from 0.013 to
0.026 mm. This was good news, because signiﬁcantly de-
grading the quality of lines in exchange for reﬁned halftone
performance would be an unacceptable compromise.
It
is possible that taking further advantage of hexagonal dot
packing by reducing dot size could increase edge ragged-
ness.

For most bitmaps printed with both square and hexago-
nal dot packing, any detectable differences between prints
were generally in density of high frequency patterns. These
density changes are presumably driven by dot size modu-
lation from changes in distance between dots on adjacent
raster lines. Unfortunately, as with vertical lines, half-dot
shifts were not directly observable in magniﬁed images of
the investigated halftone patterns.

Using the threshold array designed for square dot pack-
ing with the printer conﬁgured for hexagonal packing
slightly improved lighter tones for the 0 degree Euclidean
screen. Horizontally shifting alternating centers of verti-
cally aligned spots slightly increases the distance between
them, which would tend to decrease the size of those spots.
This effect depends on vertical cell spacing that corre-
sponds to an odd number of raster lines and does not gen-

eralize to dark tones or all screen angles. However, since
dot gain and overlap typically result in a higher proportion
of dark tones than light tones, it is potentially useful. As
expected, hexagonal packing has more inﬂuence on gray
rendition for small threshold arrays, such as 5(cid:2)5 dots (Fig-
ure 5).

Euclidean screen for hexagonal dot array

A threshold array was then generated by the Euclidean spot
function based on hexagonal dot packing geometry. For
this exercise, 6(cid:2)6 clusters were used, resulting in a 100
line screen. A 6(cid:2)6 Euclidean screen was also generated
for square dot packing, so that results could be directly
compared (Figure 6). A 6(cid:2)6 halftone cluster provides
enough gray levels to avoid contouring on many prints, and
halftone periodicity for 100 line screens can be made visi-
ble or not, by varying the distance a print is held from the
eye. A simple experiment was performed:

1. Using both screens, print a column of gray steps.
2. Overlap the pages so that both columns are visible.
3. Fix on any gray level with the prints held at arm’s

length.

4. Move the pages closer, until halftone periodicity is
just visible for that gray level on only one of the
pages.

Our results for this experiment were that the square Eu-
clidean screen was consistently visible before the hexag-
onal screen. Inspection of the spectrograms suggests that
the greater visibility of square Euclidean screens may be
largely attributable to higher ﬁrst harmonic energy (at
around 0.07 normalized frequency in Figure 7).

Figure 8 shows that low dot coverage gray levels print
lighter for hexagonal Euclidean screen than for square Eu-
clidean, as was hoped.

Ulichney screens for hexagonal grids

A motivation for applying Euclidean spot function to
hexagonal packing was that it readily lent itself to direct
comparison with square dot packing. Ulichney described
a spiral-dot screen and a tristate ordering scheme that bet-
ter exploit hexagonal dot packing, which we implemented
using 9(cid:2)6 tiles (Figure 9).

Classical spiral-dot screens are designed for ink control
in offset presses, where black dots are clustered to improve

ink ﬂow control. Laser printers, on the other hand, tend to
have more problems with isolated unprinted clusters, so a
negative spiral-dot screen produced a better distribution of
gray levels, as can be ascertained from Figure 10.

Spiral-dot screens (Figure 11) are different in the ver-
tical and horizontal directions, and their vertical and hor-
izontal spectrograms (Figure 12) are also dissimilar. The
spectrograms for negative spiral-dot (not shown) are nearly
identical to Figure 12.

Inﬂection points can be observed in middle grays of
lightness plots for both Euclidean (Figure 8) and Ulich-
ney (Figure 10) screens, because the dot clusters abruptly
connect and increase in size. This can be addressed by in-
creasing the number of clusters in a tile and sequencing the
threshold values among clusters, so that connections occur
over a wider range of gray values. This reﬁnement was not
attempted for this study. For example, the 9(cid:2)6 tiles used
for Ulichney patterns each only had 27 different threshold
values.

Conclusions

Using two versions of microcode, a single electropho-
tographic printer was conﬁgured for either hexagonal or

all differences in prints could be attributed to this single
change. Hexagonal dot packing yielded subtle but useful
improvements in gray level distribution. Spatial artifacts
for Euclidean screens based on square dot packing were
consistently apparent at slightly greater distances than for
comparable screens for hexagonal packing. Interestingly,
screens designed for hexagonal packing conferred some
of these improvements even when printed with square dot
packing. Among the Ulichney patterns for hexagonal dot
packing, spatial artifacts were more visible in EP prints
made with spiral-dot screens than the tristate screen (Fig-
ure 13), which also had a better distribution of dark gray
levels. Negative spiral-dot had better distribution of gray
levels than positive spiral-dot screen, which is presumably
at a disadvantage in EP printing because dot overlap too
quickly ﬁlls in the nearly concentric white space around
black dot clusters. Additional experiments with rotated
Ulichney hexagonal patterns may be worthwhile.
