Abstract Background/Aims: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important determinant of treatment effectiveness in dialysis patients. To our knowledge, there are no reports evaluating HRQOL of hemodialysis (HD) in Chinese patients. The purpose of this study is to present our results about HRQOL using the 36-Item Short-Form (SF-36) questionnaire on Taiwanese hemodialysis patients. Methods: HRQOL was measured by using the SF-36 questionnaire in 497 HD patients in five hospitals. Results: The following attributes, male gender, age !50 years old, higher education level (HEL), marriage status, employment status (EPS), less comorbid medical condition (CMC), and non-diabetic patients (NDP) were all predicted on a better Physical Component Scale (PCS). Age !50 years old, body mass index 118.5, HEL, EPS and NDP were all predicted on a higher Mental Component Scale (MCS). Scales contributing to a summary measure of

physical health, the PCS score was significantly lower in women (35.0 8 12.3) than in men (37.9 8 12.3). However, there was no difference in the MCS score between women and men. In multivariate analysis, age, CMC, diabetes, serum creatinine (SCr), and erythropoietin responsiveness were significant independent predictors of PCS. Diabetes, educational level, SCr, and erythropoietin responsiveness were significant independent predictors of MCS. All of the individual scales were lower in Taiwanese HD patients than in both the general Taiwanese and US population. Each of the individual scales and MCS scores were substantially lower in the Taiwan HD group than in the US HD cohort. However, the bodily pain of PCS was significantly higher in the Taiwan HD group, although the mean PCS scores for the Taiwan HD group and the US HD study participants were nearly equal at 36.3 and 36.1, respectively. Conclusion: The physical and mental aspects of quality of life are substantially lower for Taiwanese HD patients, except for higher bodily pain tolerance. A number of demographic and clinical characteristics have a significant impact on HRQOL in Taiwanese HD patients.

Introduction
In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as in most chronic diseases in which a cure is not a realistic objective, maximizing heath-related quality of life (HRQOL) is an important goal of primary care physicians [1]. Asian dialysis patients have had a markedly lower death rate than Caucasians. The difference in death rates between the two groups has been attributed to a number of factors, including lower comorbidities in the Asian dialysis population [2]. As these ESRD patients lived longer, their self-perception of health became increasingly important [3]. We applied the Chinese version of the SF-36 questionnaire that was translated in 1996 for evaluation of HRQOL in ESRD patients. We also compared our results with those observed in the general US population and the US HD cohort.
This is the first comprehensive report on HRQOL using the SF-36 questionnaire in Taiwanese HD patients. This work presents the cross-sectional relationship with a selected list of clinical and demographic variables.

Scale (MCS) scores. The PCS score reflects physical morbidity and adaptation to disease, whereas the MCS score reflects psychological or mental morbidity and adaptation. The component summary scores are positively scored and normalized to a general population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. We calculated the PCS and MCS scores for each patient with the help of the User's Manual for the SF-36 questionnaire. Higher transformed scores indicate a better HRQOL [7].
Comorbidity Information and Demographics Demographic data (age, sex), duration of hemodialysis, prescribed dialysis time, underlying etiology of ESRD, dialysis indicators, such as hematocrit, erythropoietin responsiveness (hematocrit/erythropoietin ratio, HER), serum albumin, intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) and Kt/Vurea were recorded. Marital status was also surveyed. The level of education was scored in three grades: (1) less than senior high school, (2) senior high school, and (3) university graduated or above. Comorbid conditions were summarized into the following six categories: (1) coronary artery disease (history of angina or myocardial infarction), (2) other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (hypertension, chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and neurological disease), (3) respiratory disease, (4) diabetes (DM), and (5) cancer. Thus, the maximum number of comorbid conditions was six, and the minimum was zero.

Methods
Patient Population The study design was a multicenter, cross-sectional investigation of HRQOL in ESRD patients in Taiwan. In 2002, a total of 497 dialysis patients at five hospital-based outpatient dialysis units in Taipei, Taiwan, were enrolled to evaluate their HRQOL. The Institutional Review Board of National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan approved informed consent procedures for recruiting volunteers.
HRQOL Measures We used the SF-36 questionnaire to evaluate HRQOL. Physicians or nurses hand-delivered the questionnaires to their patients. After being given a brief explanation of the questionnaire, these patients were asked to complete the questionnaire during regularly scheduled dialysis treatments. Assistance was available for patients who were illiterate or had a language problem. A new Chinese-language version of the SF-36 questionnaire was available and tested reliable [4, 5], and normative data were available for the general Chinese population [6]. The SF-36 questionnaire, a generic instrument for measuring HRQOL, developed for the Medical Outcome Study [7], is comprised of eight scales to measure physical and mental dimensions of health status. The eight scales are as follows: Physical Function (PF), Role-Physical (RP), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health Perceptions (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Functioning (SF), Role-Emotional (RE), and Mental Health (MH). The scales are scored on a 0­100 possible range. The above scales can be summarized into component summary scores, which aggregate the physical and mental components of the eight scales profile of the SF-36 questionnaire into Physical Component Scale (PCS) and Mental Component

Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were presented as mean 8 SD, unless stated otherwise. Unpaired t tests and analysis of variance were used to determine whether demographic and clinical subgroups differed with respect to summary scale scores. In addition, correlation analyses were performed between selected continuous demographic and clinical characteristics and the two standardized scores. Variables significantly associated with summary scores in different variables were added to a univariate regression model that evaluated the effect of clinical and demographic characteristics on standardized scores. Further multivariate regression was used to examine the relationships between summary scale scores and clinical and demographic variables. Variables examined were age, gender, body mass index (BMI), serum creatinine (SCr), serum albumin level, higher education level (HEL), marriage status, employment status (EPS) and comorbid medical condition (CMC). We also compared the SF-36 questionnaire scores calculated for the Taiwan cohort with scores for the following groups: the general Taiwanese and US population [6, 8] and the Hemodialysis (HEMO) Study [9].
Results
Clinical and Demographic Characteristics Selected baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of all participants (n = 497) are listed in tables 1 and 2. The study cohort was predominantly female (55.3%) with an average age of 57.8 years. Mean serum albumin levels were 4.1 g/dl. The Kt/Vurea levels in males and females were 1.30 and 1.51, respectively. Low education level (62.2%) was frequent. Most of the participants had

married or had a marriage-like relationship (73.2%). More than half (59.6%) of the participants lacked any CMC. Unemployment was common (27.6%). Average BMIs in males and females were 21.4 and 22.4 kg/m2, respectively. According to the duration of HD (table 3), the cohort was divided into three groups: the early group (!12 months), the middle group (12­60 months) and the late group (160 months). Patients with DM were fewer in the late group. Higher levels of serum albumin, creatinine, i-PTH and Kt/Vurea were observed in the late group.
Unadjusted and Adjusted Scores of the SF-36 Questionnaire Mean scores for the SF-36 individual and summary scales are listed in table 4. In the entire cohort, scales contributing to physical health (PF, RP, and GH) were generally equal to the scales associated with mental health (SF, RE, MH, and VT), with the exception of BP, which was higher than the other scales (73.6). Consistent with these observations, the mean PCS score in the cohort was substantially equal to the mean MCS score (36.3 vs. 37.5, respectively). All individual scales, except PF and BP, were significantly higher in males than females (p ! 0.05). Similarly, the value for PCS was significantly higher in males than females (p ! 0.05). The absolute difference was greater for PCS (2.9) and MCS (1.1) in males. In addition to sex, PCS and MCS scores were examined in a variety of subgroups based on clinical and demographic characteristics (table 5). Of particular interest, all PCS scores were significantly (p ! 0.05) lower among the el-

derly, females, those with a lower education level, widows, the unemployed, those with diabetes, and those with more than one self-reported comorbid medical condition. In the case of MCS, significantly lower scores were observed among the elderly, those with lower BMI and education level, the unemployed, and those with diabetes.
As listed in table 6, a statistically significant (p ! 0.05), positive correlation was observed between PCS and serum albumin, SCr and HER, but not serum cholesterol level and dialysis adequacy (Kt/Vurea). Negative correlations were found between PCS and age and serum triglyceride level. Similarly, a statistically significant, positive

correlation was observed between MCS and SCr, serum albumin and HER. Negative correlations were found between MCS and age.
Predictors of HRQOL Univariate regression techniques revealed nine factors as predictors for PCS (p ! 0.05; table 7). In further analyses applying stepwise regression techniques, five of the nine factors tested as independent predictors for PCS (p ! 0.05; table 7). They were age, diabetes, CMC, SCr and HER. Univariate regression techniques revealed seven factors as possible predictors for MCS (p ! 0.05;

table 8). In further analyses applying stepwise regression techniques, four of the seven factors tested as independent predictors for MCS (p ! 0.05; table 8). They were education level, diabetes, SCr and HER.
For continuous variables, the regression coefficient was the mean of the change in score for each unit of change in the predictor variable. For example, the mean PCS score decreased by 2.601 for each increment in number of comorbid medical conditions reported after adjusting for other factors (table 7). For such categorical variables as current diabetes status, the regression coefficient was the mean difference between groups of patients with or without the predictor variable. For example, the mean MCS of patients with diabetes was approximately 9.6 points lower than that of non-diabetic patients (NDP) after adjusting for other factors (table 8). In general, PCS and MCS scores appeared to be more strongly associated with CMC, SCr and erythropoietin responsiveness. Despite the relatively large number of variables found to be significant predictors of baseline HRQOL in multivariate analysis, their combined contributions in explaining the variance for PCS and MCS scores were only 20.7 and 15.9%, respectively (tables 7, 8).
Comparison of HRQOL in Different Populations All of the individual scores of Taiwanese HD patients were less than the values for the general Taiwanese population. The mean score for the PCS and MCS scores (36.3 vs. 50.0 and 37.5 vs. 50.0) were also less than the values for the general US population (table 9). As expected, each of the individual scales and PCS scores were substantially equal in the Taiwanese HD cohort than in the US HD study participants, except for higher scores of BP (73.6 vs. 63.9). However, each of the individual scales and MCS scores for the Taiwanese HD cohort were lower than the US HD study participants (37.5 vs. 50.1).
Discussion
This is the first report of HRQOL among HD patients in Taiwan, where ESRD patients have a lower annual mortality than patients in Western countries [2]. In our study, a higher BP scale and lower MCS scale were further demonstrated between these two groups in HD patients. We also evaluated the independent predictor of HRQOL in Chinese HD patients. Age, diabetes, CMC, SCr and erythropoietin responsiveness acted as an independent predictor of PCS scale, and education level, diabetes, SCr and erythropoietin responsiveness acted as an indepen-

population [6, 8]. The individual mental and/or MCS scores in Taiwanese HD participants was significantly lower than the established mean for the Taiwanese, general US population and the US HD cohort [8, 9]. This is different from previous studies using the SF-36 questionnaire, in which mental aspects of quality of life had been maintained, but physical aspects had decreased in HD patients [8, 10­11]. These relative differences suggest that HD influenced the HRQOL, not only in the decline in physical well-being, but also in the accumulated psychological burden during HD treatment in the Taiwanese HD group. However, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution, because no adjustments were made for age and other differences in the comparison populations.
We also observed that both the mean MCS score and the mean PCS score were higher in males. Similar sex differences have been noted in at least two other cross-sectional studies of patients with chronic renal insufficiency [12, 13] and ESRD [14, 15]. However, because SF-36 individual and summary scales are lower among males in the Taiwanese HD cohort than among men in the general US population [9], and potential confounding factors may be differentially distributed between these two groups, we cannot conclude that HD has less of an impact on males than on females in the present study. Prospective studies are necessary to determine whether quality of life declines more rapidly in females with chronic renal disease. Of particular interest, the BP domain of the PCS

score was significantly higher in the Taiwanese HD group than in the US HD cohort. This finding may be related to the background of the group, as demonstrated by the general Taiwanese and US population [6]. Chinese males are required by society to endure more of life's pressures than males in the corresponding US cohort.
In the Taiwanese HD cohort, unemployment and low education level, reported commonly, were associated with reduced HRQOL (table 5). These findings are consistent with evidence that demographic factors are important predictors of HRQOL in the general population independent of disease status and comorbidities [17, 18]. Patients who had diabetes, as previously demonstrated by Mingardi et al. [15], acted as an independent predictor of worsening HRQOL in the present study.
Albumin is known to be a very important indicator for morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients [18, 19]. Several studies [15, 20] have demonstrated the association between albumin and HRQOL scales, which was also found in our work. Low serum creatinine levels were suspected as an indicator of skeletal muscle mass loss [21]. Previous studies also have shown that SCr is directly related to serum albumin levels [22­24]. In this work, we also demonstrated that low SCr was as an independent predictor of poor HRQOL. Much attention has been given to the positive effects of maintaining an adequate delivered dose of dialysis as measured by Kt/Vurea. The range of delivered dose of dialysis for the patients participating in this study was narrow and high mean (1.42

8 0.25; table 2), and the absence of a clear distribution across a broad range of values lessens the chance of detecting an association between HRQOL and Kt/Vurea.
The malnutrition-inflammation complex has been reported to correlate with EPO hyporesponsiveness and poor outcome including decreased HRQOL and significantly greater rates of hospitalization and mortality in HD patients [25]. Recently, Sloan et al. [26] have reported that patients receiving L-carnitine had a higher HRQOL, which may be through an improvement of EPO responsiveness. In the present study, we found that patients with a good EPO hyporesponsiveness had a higher HRQOL. In our current study, hematocrit levels did not associate with HRQOL as analysis by PCS and MCS. However, subscales analysis showed four (RP, BP, SF and RE) of the SF-36 scales positive correlated with hematocrit levels (data not shown).
Recent concern has been raised about the psychometric performance of instruments used to assess HRQOL in different ethnic and racial groups [27, 28]. This report summarizes and contributes to a growing body of literature supporting the use of the SF-36 questionnaire as an instrument of measuring quality of life in HD patients. Furthermore, the relative differences among scores for healthy individuals and patients with ESRD with multiple comorbid conditions suggest that the SF-36 question-

naire is sensitive to the incremental effect of chronic illness.
Several limitations of our study deserve consideration. First, the comparison of the Taiwanese hemodialysis cohort and the US hemodialysis study participants may not be proper since there are so many determined factors for these matters, such as diet, body mass, culture of eating habits, and so on. Second, the participants appeared to have experienced longer duration (57.7 8 53.6 months) of maintenance dialysis therapy and those with comorbidity had died in this cross-sectional study. It may result in a higher percentage (59.6%) of participants who lacked any comorbid condition as compared with US dialysis patients. The influence of these differences makes us to interpret our results cautiously.
In summary, both physical and mental aspects of HRQOL are reduced significantly in the Taiwanese HD patients. Quality of life in the Taiwanese HD group was lower than that of the healthy reference group and similar to that of patients on HD therapy in the physical aspect, but lower in the mental aspect.
