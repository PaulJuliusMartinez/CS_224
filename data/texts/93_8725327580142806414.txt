A knowledge representation system for tasks like these 
must have the  ability  to  express what  is known  about 
the world  (i.e., to form  and maintain  a theory) however 
incomplete  this  knowledge may  be.  One  important 
consequence of  this  involves the  form  of  the  repre- 
sentation  itself: 
in  the  case of  VLSI  design, for  ex- 
ample,  it  may  not  be  possible to  simply  construct 
an analogue of  a chip  where representational  objects 
stand for  fragments of the  chip  and relationships  be- 
tween  these objects  correspond  to  relationships  be- 
tween the  pieces of  the  chip. 
Incomplete  knowledge 
about  a  domain  (in  the  form  of  a  theory)  need not 
look  at  all  like the  domain itself. 

The requirements in  dealing with  realistic  applica- 
tion  domains  amount  to  this:  there  are at  least two 
distinct  notions  of  adequacy that  a knowledge repre- 
sentation system for  expert tasks will  have to  address. 
Terminologicul  udequacy involves the  ability  to  form 
the  appropriate  kind  of technical  vocabulary  and un- 
derstand  the  dependencies among the  terms;  udder- 
tionul  adequacy involves the  ability  to  form  the  kind 
of theory  appropriate  to the world  knowledge of a sys- 
tem  and understand the implications  of the theory.  In 
other  words,  terminological  adequacy means getting 
the right  kind  of structured  terms and assertional ade- 
quacy means putting  the  terms  together  to  properly 
express what  is known, however incomp1ete.l 

~3 Aspects of Current  Research 

One  of  the  places to  look  for  assertions1 ade- 
quacy is in  the  standard  first  order  logical languages. 
These appear to  be ideal  for  representing knowledge 
that 
is  potentially  very  incomplete.  For  example, 
one can assert that  there  is something with  a certain 
property  without  having  to  say what  thing  has that 
property  (existential quantification),  or that  one of two 
sentences is true  without  saying which  (disjunction). 
Indeed, one view of logic is that  it  is a formal  account 

‘The  issue of  defaults  seems to  involve  both  areas.  The  need 
for  defaults  is certainly  based on  the  need for  action  given  in- 
complete  world  knowledge.  On  the  other  hand,  at  least  one 
interpretation  of  default8  is such that  it  is part  of  understand- 
ing what  is involved  with  a term  to  know  what  the  typical  (and 
atypical)  cases are. 

But  however assertionally  adequate a  first  order 
language may  be, it  has the  property  that  there  are 
no  constraints  or  interdependencies forced  on the  in- 
terpretation  of the non-logical (predicate, function,  or 
In  other  words,  the  domain  de- 
constant)  symbols. 
pendent terms  in  a  classical first  order  language are 
all  completely  independent. One can certainly  form  a 
theory  stating,  for  example, that  every  aenhancement 
mode tran&tor” 
is a “transistor”, but the language it- 
self cannot be made to  enforce this  dependency. Once 
it  is agreed that  the  theories of  a first  order  logic are 
intended to represent world  knowledge, there is simply 
no place left  to  introduce  terminology. 

In  particular, 

With  at  least  some  uobject-centeredn languages 
(i.e.,  semantic net  and frame  approaches), the  situa- 
tion  seems completely  reversed.  To  the  extent  that 
they  allow  theories  to  be formed  at  all,  these tend 
the  assumption 
to  be  very  limited. 
that  knowledge  is  based on  explicit  representations 
for  all  objects of  interest  rules out  sentences that  do 
not  have specific individuals  as the  objects of predica- 
tion.  The  emphasis, rather,  seems to  be on facilities 
for  structuring  and organizing  a set of terms  (frames, 
concepts,  units,  classes).  There  might  be  various 
ways of specializing existing terms, of aggregating mul- 
tiple  terms  into  single  structures,  of  delineating  the 
roles played by  the  components of  a structure  and of 
separating the  essential from  the  merely  prototypical 
in  the use of a term.  This  is done quite  independently 
of  any theory  about  the  world.  For  example, calling 
any transistor  that  plays a certain  role in  an inverter 
a  “@I  down trszzsistor” is not  merely  asserting that, 
as a matter  of  fact,  one set of  electrical  components 
is  the  same as  another  (as would  be the  case with 
a  universally  quantified  biconditional);  rather,  it  in- 
volves defining  a term  so that  it  is  analytically  true 
that  any component playing  that  role  is  a pull  down 
transistor. 

$4 A  Unifying  Approach 

Given  the  almost  independent  concerns  of  the 
two  (perhaps  caricatured)  representation  methodo- 
logies just  mentioned,  a  natural  organization  for  a 
knowledge representation system suggests itself:  com- 
bine  both  representation  paradigms  into  a  single, 
unified  framework.  Moreover, the  unification  we  are 
considering is not  simply  an unstructured  amalgama- 
tion  of  two  languages (nor  is  it  simply  maintaining
