SUMMARY
Objectives. To determine the response to treatment of dierent subgroups within a sample of physically ill elderly depressed patients.
Design. Acute geriatric medical inpatients with depression, randomly assigned to an 8-week double-blind placebocontrolled trial of ¯uoxetine.
Main outcome measure. Response rate as de®ned by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Results. Data were analysed in subgroups according to diagnosed physical problems and concomitant medication. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify subgroups valid for separate analysis. Those reaching at least 5 weeks of treatment showed a signi®cant improvement compared with the placebo group if they had serious lifethreatening disease, cerebrovascular disease, were not demented, or were either on no analgesics or on analgesics stronger than paracetamol. Conclusion. While the response to treatment in these subgroups was encouraging, general physicians must not be led to believe that the answer to depression lies only in pharmacological intervention, just as the belief that the risk± bene®t ratio of such treatment where indicated is too high must be discouraged. # 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Little is known of the prognosis of psychiatric disorders identi®ed in hospitalized physically ill patients (Mayou et al., 1988). Hawton (1981) found that psychiatric disturbance often persisted, especially in patients with a previous history of psychiatric disorder. Feldman et al. (1987) interviewed patients after discharge and found that only two-thirds were improved psychiatrically at 4 months follow-up. Mayou et al. (1988), reporting the same study, found that those with an aective disorder on admission continued to make greater demands on medical, social and psychiatric services than matched controls and had double

the mortality rate (although this did not reach signi®cance).
Several studies have suggested that medically ill depressed patients respond poorly to antidepressant treatment (Popkin et al., 1985; Baldwin and Jolley, 1986; Meats et al., 1991), although that is not the experience of others (Evans, 1993; Evans and Lye, 1992; Lakshmanan et al., 1986; Gregory et al., 1992). Popkin et al. (1985) retrospectively reviewed case notes and suggested that pharmacotherapy may not be the answer to depressive illness emerging secondary to physical problems and that `the clinician confronted with depressive syndromes in the physically ill should consider forms of intervention other than tricyclic antidepressants'. However, the antidepressants used in this study were ®rst generation tricyclics: imipramine (most responders), amitriptyline and desipramine (most side-eects), nortriptyline or doxepin. Newer antidepressants, especially the

5-HT reuptake inhibitors, are becoming the drugs of choice in the physically ill depressed patient because of their lack of anticholinergic side-eects, reduced cardiotoxicity and much diminished likelihood of inducing confusion. Popkin's paper may best be viewed as an invitation to prescribe, when appropriate, the less toxic antidepressants now available, rather than as an excuse for therapeutic nihilism in this dicult group of patients.
A 12-month open prospective study (Evans, 1993) of geriatric medical inpatients showed a signi®cant response (p < 0.03) to treatment of those with concomitant depression with ¯uoxetine versus no treatment. The mortality rate in the depressed group was nearly 50% at 1 year, compared with 35% in those psychologically well. The majority of deaths in the depressed group occurred in the ®rst 3 months of the study, most before the depression had responded to treatment. The death rate in this group returned to that of the prospectively followed up psychologically well group for the ®nal 9 months of the study, suggesting that the depressive illness had a direct eect on the mortality rate.
Akiskal and colleagues (1981) reported that depression was likely to have a poor prognosis, either becoming recurrent or chronic, when accompanied by a non-aective disorder whether psychiatric or medical. Koenig et al. (1992) screened and followed up consecutive acute geriatric medical admissions to a veterans hospital and demonstrated that major depression diagnosed in these patients did not resolve once the patient left hospital, over 60% persisting without improvement. Less than 45% of these patients had received antidepressants at all, 20% had been given benzodiazepines and less than 25% had been treated for more than 1 week. The `considerable amount' of therapeutic nihilism found was considered by the author to be due to worries over the risk±bene®t ratio of known therapiesÐin the study reported he refers to tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors only. He concluded that an eective treatment for depression in elderly patients needs to be found, with widespread education of geriatricians in the diagnosis and treatment of depression.
Gregory et al. (1992) suggest that explanations for the apparent association of medical illness with poor treatment outcome might include: (1) age as a confounding factorÐmost of the trials of treatment in the physically ill are in elderly patients; (2) medically ill patients may be given inadequate

doses of antidepressants because of problems with side-eects or overcautious physicians; (3) dierent subtypes of depression exist, some medicationresponsive, some not.
To determine whether the response to treatment of the physically ill depressed elderly is related to their physical pathology and/or treatment, data from a double-blind placebo-controlled trial (Evans et al., 1997) were analysed in subgroups according to diagnosed physical problems and concomitant medication.
METHOD
Patients aged 65 years and over admitted to the acute geriatric or general medical wards at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital were eligible for the initial project, which was a double-blind, randomized parallel-group study. Subjects received either placebo or ¯uoxetine 20 mg in the mornings for a target period of 8 weeks. The primary dependent variable was depression measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) (Hamilton, 1960), with a good response de®ned as reduction in score of 50% and/or a ®nal score of 10 or less.
Physical history was extracted from all available medical case notes, with physical examination, results of laboratory tests or other investigations and concomitant medication also recorded. Physical illnesses were rated as mild, moderate or severe, acute or chronic (Burvill, 1990). Ratings were done on entry to the study by one author (ME), relapse or new illness was recorded as it occurred as an adverse event by another (MH).
Subjects were seen at weeks 1, 3, 5 and 8 after entry into the study. Depressive symptoms were evaluated and scored using the HAMD. Pulse and blood pressure, concomitant medication and contact with medical professionals were also recorded together with details of any adverse events.
Ecacy analyses were carried out on those completing 3 or 5 weeks of treatment. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify subgroups reaching at least a trend (p < 0.10) in the interactions, and thus which groups would be valid for separate analysis. Further analysis of the subgroups used Fishers exact test as sample size was small. All tests were two-tailed.
Data from patients reaching at least 3 weeks of treatment were entered into the ecacy analysis, and then subgroup analyses were performed

according to diagnosed physical problems and concomitant medication. The main subgroup, those with a serious physical illness de®ned as cardiac or respiratory disease rated moderate or severe, or diagnosis of neoplasm known to the patient, is discussed elsewhere (Evans et al., 1997). Further analysis of disease by system involvement was performed, looking at respiratory, cardiac, bone and joint problems and cerebrovascular disease. Level of cognitive impairment was also considered, using MMSE score of 23 or less as indicative of impairment in this age group (Folstein et al., 1975).
Analyses were then carried out based on the types of medication each patient was receiving as this meant the illness was at least severe enough to warrant treatment. Inhalers used were bronchodilators or steroids for the treatment of chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD). Cardiac medication was de®ned as digoxin, loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors and/or nitrates. The majority of patients were taking analgesics such as paracetamol, with some also using mild opiates such as coproxamol or dihydrocodeine. Painful conditions warranting chronic treatment varied from recurrent headaches or arthritis to abdominal pains.
RESULTS
82 subjects entered the study, 20 men and 62 women, mean age 80.4 years (SD 6.6); 51 completed ®ve weeks of treatment and 42 the full eight

weeks of the study. Exclusion criteria and reasons for withdrawl have been reported elsewhere (Evans et al., 1997). Eect of treatment on the groups as a whole did not reach signi®cance, although at eight weeks nearly twice as many patients in the ¯uoxetine group had responded to treatment, compared with the placebo group (67% vs 38%).
From the data of those reaching at least 5 weeks of treatment, the subgroups showing a trend in the interaction of the regression analysis were: serious physical illness, cerebrovascular disease, MMSE < 24, and those patients using paracetamol. Analysing data from those reaching at least 3 weeks of treatment (i.e. larger numbers), a trend in the interaction was also seen in those patients using inhalers and those using night sedation.
No trend was seen in those groups with cardiac disease, respiratory disease or neoplasm when analysed separately, nor in those using cardiac medication or laxatives. The group using painkillers stronger than paracetamol was analysed despite a trend not being shown on logistic regression, as the authors wished to see if antidepressants showed any eect in this group with more severe pain.
Results of the subgroup analysis can be seen in Table 1.
DISCUSSION
It is important that depressive illness is treated when appropriate as it is well established that

depression increases morbidity and mortality in the elderly (Baldwin and Jolley, 1986; Evans et al., 1991; Mayou et al., 1988; Murphy, 1983). It is, however, of equal importance that ineective or unnecessary treatment is not given, both because of the risk of drug interactions or adverse reactions and also because of the ®nancial cost.
The group of patients entered into this study were heterogeneous, with diering physical problems. Recruitment of such a group was considered valid as this is the reality of clinical practice. Our results have shown that there are subgroups within this population with diering response to treatment, or perhaps with dierent types of depressive illness, which present similar signs and symptoms. The depression diagnosed on entry to the study should not be seen as reactive to admission as both the screening process and diagnostic criteria for entry to this trial referred to mental state in the previous 4 weeks.
All illnesses except the very trivial involve an element of psychological adjustment. Serious physical illness is likely to be a potent psychological stressor aecting body image, self-esteem, sense of identity, capacity to live independently and to maintain social and family relationships (Rodin and Voshart, 1986). Three-quarters of the patients in our study met the criteria for life-threatening illness and showed a signi®cant dierence in response to active or placebo treatment. Conversely, the smaller group with less severe physical problems showed no dierence in treatment response and were perhaps suering from senile dysphoria as described by Baldwin and Jolley (1986), where the mood disorder appears to be precipitated by chronic physical illness, and is not responsive to pharmacotherapy but does respond to psychosocial intervention.
Cerebrovascular disease was de®ned as those patients with diagnosed transient ischaemic attacks and/or stroke, either currently or in the past. As long ago as 1962, Kay reported that arteriosclerotic brain disease may play a role in precipitating depression in approximately 10% of cases of late onset aective disorder. Magni et al. (1985) showed by regression analysis of their sample of 178 acute medical inpatients that CNS disease and depression were linked. However, the mechanism for this linkage is not clear. After a stroke, physical disability and social handicap can be understood as mediating factors; site of lesion and amount of brain involved may be important, but current knowledge is contradictory. Robinson et al.

(1983) have postulated destruction of speci®c catecholamine pathways as an aetiological factor. In the subgroup discussed in this article, ischaemic damage of at least a subclinical level is likely to have been occurring in the majority, although the site and extent of damage are not known. Damage to catecholamine pathways may explain the signi®cant response to ¯uoxetine ( p < 0.02), a medication which would potentiate the serotonin available.
Analysis of the subgroup by cognitive level found those who were cognitively intact (N  21) showed a highly signi®cant response to active medication (p  0.008) whereas those with cognitive impairment (N  30) did not.
Brain damage with cognitive loss probably impairs the coping ability of the personality and may also damage those areas or pathways in the brain that encourage natural amine production. Follow-up treatment during this trial included the development of a close supportive relationship with the researcher and this was considered to have been a factor in producing the placebo response rate in the whole group of 38%. Supportive therapy probably works through emotionally mediated responses, which may be impaired by the hopelessness of depression felt by those with intact cognition. Supportive relationships can be seen to be important in those with cognitive impairment; perceived or real lack of these may perhaps be a factor in the high incidence of depression found in residential care (Evans et al., 1995; Ames, 1990).
Respiratory disease likely to produce dyspnoea is uncomfortable and frightening. It enforces limitations to physical activity, and when severe can lead to feelings of impending death. In their community study, Evans et al. (1991) found a direct relationship between the severity of the dyspnoea and the presence of depressive illness. In the present study, the group diagnosed with respiratory disease did not show dierences in interaction to warrant being analysed as a separate subgroup, but when those actually on treatment for these problems (perhaps an indication of subjective severity) were analysed, a signi®cant dierence in response to treatment was shown.
The relationship of depression to pain is complex. Pain is a subjective experience; it can vary within the same person depending on time and circumstances. Elderly patients, often with some social and perceptual isolation and inward focus for their thoughts and perceptions, frequently

suer from chronic pain. Depression aects pain awareness. A depressed chronically sick patient is often intolerant of pain which is accepted without complaint when the mood is elevated. It can therefore be suggested that the need for analgesia in the elderly with chronic conditions may be linked to the development of a depressive illness needing treatment. Alternatively, it is well known in pain clinics that addition of antidepressants in subtherapeutic doses to analgesics can help in cases of intractable pain. Various mechanisms have been described for this action, from increasing serotonin availability (Stimmel and Escobar, 1986) to the inhibition of encephalin degradation (Hendler, 1984). Improvement with active treatment was not seen in the group taking paracetamol, perhaps because many elderly patients take paracetamol for various reasons other than analgesia, for instance as night sedation.
Depression has been found in 20±50% of acute cardiac patients and 70% or more of these will remain depressed 3 months later (Stern et al., 1976; Schleifer et al., 1989). In our sample over 70% were receiving cardiac medication of some kind, but regression analysis using this subgroup did not warrant its inclusion as a separate group. This can be understood by the fact that myocardial infarction, mild congestive cardiac failure or peripheral vascular disease were all classi®ed as `cardiovascular'. Separate diagnoses had been recorded for each patient, together with an estimate of severity of mild, moderate or severe, but the numbers of patients with each individual diagnosis were too few to make individual analyses possible.
This study has shown a positive response to the treatment of depression by medication in the presence of serious physical illness or cerebrovascular disease. It has also shown the importance of a supportive relationship in the resolution of depression in those with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. General physicians must not be led to believe that the answer to depressive illness lies in pharmacological intervention; equally to be discouraged is the belief that the risk±bene®t ratio of such treatment where indicated is too high. The pharmacological treatment given, ¯uoxetine 20 mg mane, was well tolerated by all patients in the trial (Evans et al., 1997), and showed a very low risk± bene®t ratio, as would be expected from the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The SSRIs should now be accepted as the antidepressants of choice in the physically ill elderly.

Further work is required to determine the speci®c eect of various physical illnesses on the prevalence of depression in elderly patients and its response to treatment.
