What is an Agent ?

External Definition : a real or virtual entity that
evolves in an environment, that is able to  perceive
this environment, that is able to act in this
environment, that is able to  communicate with other
agents, and that exhibits an autonomous behaviour
---> the autonomy principle
Internal Definition : a real or virtual entity that
encompasses some local control in some of its
perception , communication , knowledge
acquisition , reasoning , decision , execution,
action processes.
---> the delegation principle

But there is no agent without multi-agent systems !

CNRS Leibniz IMAG

Yves DEMAZEAU

What is a Multi-Agent System ?

A set of possibly organized agents which interact
in a  common environment
---> the distribution principle

MAS main interests :

---> To extend classical
mono-agent AI models
and tools (A-centered)

---> To study specific
multi-agent models
and tools (MAS-centered)

MAS Micro and Macro Issues

Micro issues (Agent oriented)

n how do we design and build an agent that is capable of

acting autonomously

n are oriented towards mental and environmental issues
n are typical of agent theories (Cohen & Levesque, Rao &

Georgeff, Shoham, Singh, Wooldridge & Jennings,  ...)

Macro issues (MAS oriented)

n how do we get a society of agents to cooperate

effectively?

issues

n are oriented towards interactions and organisations

n are typical of multi-agent theories (Durfee, Ferber,

Gasser, Hewitt, Lesser...)

How to bridge between Micro and Macro Issues

Which applications are better handled by MAS ?

MAS methods cater for distributed intelligence
applications : Network based, Human involved,
Physically distributed, Decentralized controlled, ...

It suits when only local computational models are
available whilst global ones are unknown

n Telecommunications, Internet Applications, Vision, NLP,

...

It is adequate for application domains and kinds of
problem as soon as non-provability is acceptable

Qualification criteria and selected platforms

Four qualities for each stages:
n Completeness: quantity & quality
n Applicability:  scope, restrictions
n Complexity: competence required, workload
n Reusability: reuse of previous work

—> 16 criteria + availability & support

Platforms requirements

n based on a strong academic model
n high quality software, well maintained
n cover as many aspects as possible of MAS
n cover the four methodological stages

—> AgentBuilder, Jack, Madkit, Zeus

n As of first semester 2000

CNRS Leibniz IMAG

Yves DEMAZEAU

Pitfalls of current MAS offers

Completeness

n Much on development… nothing about analysis/design
n Much focus on approach… but poor technical aspects
n Nothing about deployment
Ł Every stage must be developed in the platform !

Applicability

n An agent platform…but not a multi-agent platform
n A generalisation of a specific multi-agent system

…multi-domain, but single-problem platform

n Fixed models, and no way to escape
Ł The platform must be as versatile as possible !

Complexity

n The documentation is sparse
n You have to code a lot
n The user interface is unfriendly
Ł Understanding, (re)using the platform must be facilitated !

MAS Approach : Decomposing into Entities

A new approach to analyze and design SS

1. MAS are situated, and the real environment
differs from the perceived environment
2. The methods are mainly process-centered, but
non-only task-based
3. The methods involve both declarative and
computational specifications
4. The control is mainly decentralized, highly
modular, it is distributed among entities and partly
in an emergence engine
5. The entry point of the design is not unique nor
imposed, even usually focused on Agents first
6. VOWELS decomposes the MAS into A, E, I, O
7. ...

CNRS Leibniz IMAG

Yves DEMAZEAU

MAS Models : Modelling these Entities

New models supported by existing formalisms

1. At higher abstraction level than other existing
methods, closer to natural human way of thinking
and reasoning about systems, not only devoted to
computer scientists
2. It does not supply any new formalism currently,
but entities are formalized using existing
formalisms like traditional logics, Petri nets,
algebraic languages, design patterns,...
3. VOWELS As range from reactive to cognitive
4. VOWELS Es range from spatial to topological
5. VOWELS Is range from forces to speech acts
6. VOWELS Os range from groups to markets
7. ...

CNRS Leibniz IMAG

Yves DEMAZEAU

MAS Tools : Developing these Entities

New tools integrating existing paradigms

1. MAS is not (yet?) an implementation model and
MAS oriented tools are usually not specific
2. Agents themselves just begin to have their own
languages
3. MAS Development relies on existing languages
and programming paradigms
4. The trend of the work is towards Multi-Agent
Oriented Programming, meaning programming
MAS with MAS tools
5. The closest related tools for VOWELS seems be
frameworks but are still under investigation from
the computational point of view
6. ...

Yves DEMAZEAU

How MAS Methodology is specific ?

Method = Approach + Model + Tools + Application

It provides a new analysis and design approach

It is supported by existing formalisms,

It integrates existing programming paradigms,

It is striving towards industrial quality,

It caters for distributed intelligence applications,

It will always imply difficulties in provability.

Vowels Oriented Programming

We defend an instance of MAOP, the VOWELS
method in which on should :

n 1/ to express the problem to solve independently of the

domain

and recursion

n 2/ to "vowellify" the problem in terms of A E I O, ...
n 3/ to choose understood frames of A, E, I, O, dynamics,

n 4/ to leave VOWELS "emergence engine" complete the
missing bricks by itself and build the appropriate MAS...

n 5/ ... to be deployed as self on a distributed settling...
n 6/ ... to be settled and used interactively
