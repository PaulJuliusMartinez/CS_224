2005-06 OUTLOOK

The Old Dominion University Monarch golf squad returns four lettermen from last year's squad that had six top ten finishes in the spring season. The Monarch returnees include seniors Nick Kenney and Greg Sampson, sophomores Stan Guerrero, Kyle Hartlaub, and newcomers Christopher Barach, Kevin Bryce, Jeffrey Long, Matthew Rendell and Matthew Watson.

In the fall of 2005, the Monarchs finished strong. ODU had four top five finishes, highlighted by the first place title at its own ODU/ Seascape Collegiate in Kitty Hawk, NC. The Monarchs had two third place finishes at the Joe Agee and Mission Inn Collegiate tournaments and a fifth place finish at the Raines tournament.

"We were in the top five in four fall tournaments, including a come-from-behind victory at the ODU/Seascape event," said head coach Murray Rudisill. "The team stroke average was 289.5 for the 14 rounds in the Fall. This is a tremendous improvement over the past two years and should elevate the national ranking of the Monarchs squad. The senior leadership of Greg Sampson and Nick Kenney has also helped the young squad improve dramatically during the fall season. Everyone is very enthusiastic about the spring season which begins in February."

Greg Sampson picked up where he left off last year as ODU's top golfer in three of the fall events. Nick Kenney was ODU's top performer in one and freshman Matthew Watson led the Monarchs 2 in three events.
Last Year, Sampson led ODU in five tournaments which included an eighth place at Wofford and a sixth at Mission Inn, while Kenney took seventh at Matlock and Guerrero was 11th at the CAA Championships.

Nick Kenney

Monarch newcomers have some outstanding credentials and are already showing promise for the future. Matthew Watson, the two-time Virginia AAA state runner-up placed third at the ODU/ Seascape and eighth at Mission Inn. Jeffrey Long, a first team All-State selection from Centreville VA. was 15th at the ODU/ Seascape. Matthew Rendell comes to ODU from Reading England, the same town that produced one of ODU's top golfers in two-time CAA Player of the Year Geoff Harris ('03). Rendell has already broken many of Harris' records in England. He will red shirt this season. Christopher Barach placed in the top four of the New York State Championships the last two seasons at Niskayuna High School, while Kevin Bryce was the Toronto Star's top private school athlete and Canadian Independent School's Champion.

Once again, the Monarchs will be playing some of the toughest competition in the Southeast this season as they look to continue the proud tradition of success that has become a staple of the Old Dominion golf program. The City of Norfolk opened the new ninewhole golf course in Lambert's Point next to the ODU campus which provides the Monarchs with state of the art locker room, facilities, office space, and practice facilities.

"The Monarchs are a fairly young squad this year with seven of the nine golfers being freshmen or sophomores," notes Rudisill. "Two outstanding freshmen Jeff Long and Matt Watson have jumped into the starting line-up and have made an immediate impact. Matt Watson's stroke average for the fall was 71.8 which is very good for any college player and especially a freshman. Stan Guerrero played great in the fall as well."

Dr.MurrayRudisill

Head Coach

A five-time conference and four-time Virginia State Coach of the Year, Dr. Murray Rudisill has been the head coach at Old Dominion University for 30 years. During his tenure,

the Monarch program has grown into one of the top rated teams in

the Southeast.

In 2004, the Monarchs took second at the Colonial Athletic

Association Championships, and Rudisill was named Virginia

College Coach of the Year. In 2003, ODU captured their first ever

CAA championship with a sudden death playoff win over UNC

Wilmington. That earned the Monarchs their first ever NCAA team

tournament appearance. The Monarchs tied for 15th at the West

Regionals. Geoffrey Harris was named CAA Player of the Year for

the second straight time and also earned All-Region honors.

Harris was also one of five finalists for the prestigious Byron Nelson

Award.

Rudisill earned CAA Coach of the Year honors in 2003 which

adds to his previous honors in 1999 and 2000 along with Coach of

the Year honors in the Sun Belt in 1984 and 1989. He was selected

Virginia College Coach of the Year by the Portsmouth Sports Club

in 1988, and his fellow coaches in the State of Virginia have selected him Coach of the Year in the

state in 1988, 2000, 2003 and 2004.

Rudisill has served on the board of Directors for

the Virginia State Golf Association, and is serving

his fourth, five-year term as chairman of the Virginia

State Golf Coaches Association. Additionally, he has

served as chairman for the selection committee for

the NCAA Golf District III. Rudisill is a member of

the board of trustees of College Golf Fellowship.

Two of Rudisill's former golfers, Jim McGovern

and Joe Daley qualified for the PGA tour in 1998. In

1991, Jon Hurst became the first Monarch to qualify

at the NCAA Division I Championships in

Monterey, CA., and earned All-American honors.

Hurst along with Alan Schulte, a two-time Sun Belt

Conference champion are both in the ODU Sports

Hall of Fame.

Rudisill has coached back-to-back CAA Rookie's of the Year in Michael Hospodar in 1999 and

Geoffrey Harris in 2000. The 1999 Monarch squad ranked first in the nation in par three scoring at

3.11. The 2000 squad lost the CAA Championships by one stroke and ranked in the top ten in the

district and the nation's top 50.

In 2002, Geoffrey Harris ranked as high as second nationally with a stroke average at 70.0 after

the fall season, and later competed in the

prestigious Palmer Cup for native Great

Britain against team USA. Strengthening his reputation as an excellent
golfer with top performances in regional and amateur events, Rudisill has teamed with Old Dominion Hall of Fame golfer J.P.Leigh to win over 50 tournaments in the area.
A native of Gastonia, NC, Rudisill is a 1960 graduate of North Carolina State University where he was a member of the golf team.
