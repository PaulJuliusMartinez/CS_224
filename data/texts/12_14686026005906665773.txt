In moving further into the age of machine intelligence and automated reasoning, we have reached a point where we can speak, without exaggeration, of systems which have a high machine IQ (MIQ). The Web and especially search engines -with Google at the top -- fall into this category. In the context of the Web, MIQ becomes Web IQ, or WIQ, for short.

PREAMBLE
In moving further into the age of machine intelligence and automated reasoning, we have reached a point where we can speak, without exaggeration, of systems which have a high machine IQ (MIQ). The Web and especially search engines -- with Google at the top -- fall into this category. In the context of the Web, MIQ becomes Web IQ, or WIQ, for short.

WEB INTELLIGENCE
l Existing search engines have many remarkable capabilities. However, what is not among them is the deduction capability -- the capability to synthesize an answer to a query by drawing on bodies of information which reside in various parts of the knowledge base.
5 LAZ 10/7/2003

CONTINUED
l A question-answering system is by definition a system which has deduction capability. One of the principal goals of Web intelligence is that of evolving search engines into question-answering systems. Achievement of this goal requires a quantum jump in the WIQ of existing search engines.

QUANTUM JUMP IN WIQ
l Can a quantum jump in WIQ be achieved through the use of existing tools such as the Semantic Web and ontology-centered systems--tools which are based on bivalent logic and bivalent-logic-based probability theory?
8 LAZ 10/7/2003

CONTINUED
l It is beyond question that, in recent years, very impressive progress has been made through the use of such tools. But, a view which is advanced in the following is that bivalent-logicbased methods have intrinsically limited capability to address complex problems which arise in deduction from information which is pervasively illstructured, uncertain and imprecise.

WORLD KNOWLEDGE
The major problem is World Knowledge
10 LAZ 10/7/2003

WHAT IS WORLD KNOWLEDGE?
l world knowledge is acquired through experience and education
examples l usually it is hard to find parking near the
campus between 9 and 5 l big cars are safer than small cars l few professors are rich
11 LAZ 10/7/2003

WORLD KNOWLEDGE AND THE WEB KEY POINTS
l world knowledge plays a pivotal role in human cognition

l in particular, world knowledge forms the basis for disambiguation, decision-making, deduction and search

l specific: Helsinki is the capital of Finland

l general: Icy roads are slippery

WORLD KNOWLEDGE: EXAMPLES
specific: l if Robert works in Berkeley then it is likely that
Robert lives in or near Berkeley l if Robert lives in Berkeley then it is likely that
Robert works in or near Berkeley generalized:
if A/Person works in B/City then it is likely that A lives in or near B precisiated: Distance (Location (Residence (A/Person), Location (Work (A/Person) isu near
protoform: F (A (B (C)), A (D (C))) isu R
13 LAZ 10/7/2003

CONTINUED
l the Web is, in the main, a repository of specific world knowledge
l Semantic Web and related systems serve to enhance the performance of search engines by adding to the web a collection of relevant fragments of world knowledge
l the problem is that much of world knowledge, and especially general world knowledge, consists of perceptions
14 LAZ 10/7/2003

CONTINUED
l perceptions are intrinsically imprecise l imprecision of perceptions stands in the way
of representing the meaning of perceptions through the use of conventional bivalentlogic-based languages l to deal with perceptions and world knowledge, new tools are needed l of particular relevance to enhancement of web intelligence are Precisiated Natural Language (PNL) and Protoform Theory (PFT)

PROTOFORMAL DEDUCTION THE ROBERT EXAMPLE
l The Robert example is intended to serve as an illustration of protoformal deduction. In addition, it is intended to serve as a test of ability of standard probability theory, PT, to operate on perception-based information
IDS: Usually Robert returns from work at about 6 pm
TDS: What is the probability that Robert is home at about t pm?
80 LAZ 10/7/2003

CONCLUSION
l addition of significant question-answering capability to search engines is a complex, open-ended problem
l incremental progress, but not much more, is achievable through the use of bivalent-logicbased methods
l to achieve significant progress, it is imperative to develop and employ techniques based on computing with words, protoform theory, precisiated natural language and computational theory of perceptions
