Abstract: Flight testing of a fully-instrumented model-scale unmanned helicopter (Yamaha R-50 with 10ft. diameter rotor) was conducted for the purpose of dynamic model identification. This paper describes the application of CIFER® system identification techniques, which have been developed for full size helicopters, to this aircraft. An accurate, high-bandwidth, linear state-space model was derived for the hover condition. The model structure includes the explicit representation of regressive rotor-flap dynamics, rigid-body fuselage dynamics, and the yaw damper. The R-50 configuration and identified dynamics are compared with those of a dynamically scaled UH-1H. The identified model shows excellent predictive capability and is well suited for flight control design and simulation applications.

helicopters in light of what is known about full-size helicopters. Dynamic scaling rules are used to compare the configuration and identified dynamics of the small-size R50 with the full-size UH-1H helicopter. This is especially interesting here because the comparison takes place within the specific framework of system identification, thereby allowing for simple and explicit analyses ranging from questions about the model structure to more precise aspects such as the modal characteristics or even physical parameters.

Once again, this close agreement is somewhat better than what is usually achieved in full-size helicopters. This can be attributed to the dynamics of the small-size helicopter being dominated by the rotor dynamics and the absence of complex aerodynamic effects.
Time Domain Verification
Time domain verification was conducted by driving the identified models with flight data not used in the identification process. The results, which are presented in Figure 4 and 5 in the Appendix, show an excellent agreement between the model predictions and the flight data for all control axes and outputs except the yaw response, where a small amount of mismatch is present. This is accounted for by the presence of the active yaw damping system and the mixing between the pedal and collective input. Better results could be obtained if both systems were disabled during the flight experiments or if the actual actuator inputs were measured.
