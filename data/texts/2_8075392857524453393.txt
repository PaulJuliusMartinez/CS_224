IP Addressing
 Identify each node on the IP network  A common addressing scheme
 Independent from the data link layer
 IP address
 addressing on network level  unique 32-bit number

IP Address Notation
10000010 11101101 11010100 00011001
130.237.212.25
 Written as four decimal numbers with dots '.' between
 Each decimal number represents the binary value of one byte
 Dotted-decimal notation
 "dot address", "dotted quad address", ... 7

IP Address Structure

Network

Host

 An address has two purposes: 1. Uniquely identify a host (identifier) 2. Give the location of the host (locator)
 For that purpose, an address has two parts  Network (prefix, netid)  Host (suffix, hostid)
 Network identifies a network
 Host identifies a node on that network
 Network and Host together identify a node on the Internet

Reserved for future use

0.0.0.0-127.0.0.0 128.0.0.0-191.0.0.0 192.0.0.0-223.0.0.0 224.0.0.0-239.0.0.0 240.0.0.0-255.0.0.0

 The address class is identified by the first few bits
 Boundary between network and host parts is at a fixed location (for each class)

9

IP Addressing Example

 Size of cloud ~ number of hosts; determines the class of address

10

Classful Addressing Allocation

A 128 networks with 16 777 216 hosts each

B 16 384 networks with 64536 hosts each
C 2 097 152 networks with 256 hosts each D E 268 435 456 multicast groups

11

Address Space Depletion
 Class A too large for most organizations  No address class suitable for mid-size
organisations
 C too small  B too large
 Fear to run out of Class B addresses in early 90's
 Still only using about 5% of the total address space!
13

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
 No fixed boundaries between network and host
 IP network addresses represented as a prefix
 Address and a prefix length  Written as 192.16.30.0/20  Prefix length can take any value
o Between 0 and 32
 More flexibility in network size
15

Address Mask
 A network address can be specified as address and a bit mask
o For example 192.16.30.0/20 : -- 192.16.30.0 mask 255.255.240.0 (or mask FFFFF000)
 The network address can be computed by applying the mask to any address within the subnet (bitwise AND)

Next-hop Routing
 Routing table gives next node on the path to destination
18

IP and MAC Addresses

 In order to forward a packet, a router needs data link layer address (MAC address) of next hop
 At a router:  Next hop IP address determined from the routing table  Next hop IP address translated to next hop MAC address  Packet transferred using next hop MAC address

19

Address Resolution
 Mapping between an IP and a MAC address
 within the same physical network
 Different alternatives
 table lookup o all mappings stored in a table in memory o e.g. X.25 network
 closed form computation o translation using simple Boolean operations o e.g. token ring
 message exchange o e.g. Ethernet: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
20

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
21

ARP (cont'd)
 Address mappings are stored in a cache
 Reduces ARP message exchanges
o oldest one out o not used out  A node answering an ARP request can store the sender's addresses in the cache
 Mappings are removed after a certain period of time  Needs to be refreshed
22

IP Datagram Forwarding
 Datagram transmission
 Connectionless
 Non-confirmed delivery
 No acknowledgement that the packet has been received
 Best-effort service
 no dedicated transmission capacity
 Responsibility of higher layer to guarantee delivery
23

IP Header

 Version (VER) = 4
 Header length (HLEN) (32-bit units)  Header is 20-60 bytes  Typically HLEN=5 (20 bytes, no options)
 Service type (DS)  Quality of service purposes
 Total length (bytes)  Header + data, max 65 536 bytes
 Identification, flags, offset  For fragmentation
 Time to live  Max number of routers to pass  Decremented at each router hop
o Dropped if zero  Prevent errors due to loops
 Protocol  TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc
 Header checksum  16-bit checksum of all fields in header  Recomputed at each hop

4-bit 4-bit 8-bit type of VER HLEN service

16-bit total length (bytes)

16-bit identification

3-bit 13-bit fragmentation

flags

offset

8-bit time to live (TTL)

8-bit protocol

16-bit header checksum

32-bit source IP address

32-bit destination IP address

Options

25

Fragmentation
 MTU--Maximum Transmission Unit  Any router may fragment a packet  Packet is reassemblied at the receiver
26

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

 Indicated by protocol type "ICMP" in IP header
 Error messages  Destination unreachable
o No route, fragmentation needed, port does not exists, ...  Time exceeded
o TTL, Packet reassembly  Parameter problem
o Bad IP header  Redirect
o Use other router  (Source quench--flow/congestion control)
 Query messages  Echo request/reply (Ping)  (Time stamp, address mask, router solicitation)

27

Structure of the Internet
 Internet Service Provider
 Provide Internet access
 Carriers
 Interconnect ISPs  Peering agreements
between carriers

Autonomous Systems
 Group of networks and routers under same administrative control
 Interior routing protocol--within an autonomous system  Exterior routing protocol--between autonomous
systems

Next router 172.12.33.1 212.23.97.4 221.2.1.17

 Bellman-Ford algorithm  Router keeps list of minimum hop counts (or costs)
 List is sent to all neighbor routers  Periodical updates  Routing Information Protocol (RIP)  Internal routing

30

RIP Updates

31

Link State Routing
 Dijkstra's algorithm  Link state information
 State of neighborhood  Flooding
 Each router sends link information to its neighbors  The neighbors forward the information to their neighbors,
and so on  Interior routing protocols
 Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)  Intermediate System-Intermediate System (IS-IS)
32

OSPF Areas
 Routers inside an area flood the area  Area border routers summarize to other
areas
33

Exterior Routing

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
 Path vector routing  Routing based on policies
 Administrative rules  Shortest path not always sufficient
o Some autonomous systems may be preferred to others
o Security, reliability, etc o Internal structure kept private
 Receives routing information from interior routing protocols
