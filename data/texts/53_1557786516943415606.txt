Dedicated to T. Rivlin on the occasion of his 70th birthday

Lower and upper bounds are given for the trace of the inverse tr(A?1) and the

determinant det(A) of a symmetric positive de nite matrix A. They are derived

by

applying Gaussian quadrature and related theory.
The bounds for det(A) appears to be new. For the

bounds

of

tr(A?1),

the

Kantorovich inequality is available for providing such bounds. In a number of

examples, our bounds are found to be tighter when simple trial vectors are used in

Kantorovich's bound. The new bounds are equivalent to Robinson and Wathen's

variational bounds. But our of the summation of bounds

Two other types of bounds for (A?1)ii are also presented in 13], but more information

is required.

The third approach is to use Gaussian quadrature and related theory. As discussed

in 4, 5, 1], one rst bounds the quantity xTf(A)x for a given vector x, then probabilistic

bounds and estimates can be obtained for tr(f(A)) by using Monte Carlo simulation. We

refer to 1] for details.

The new bounds derived in this paper also use Gaussian quadrature and related

theory. But they are exact lower and upper bounds for tr(f(A)) instead of probabilistic

bounds as given in 1]. The new bounds are derived by directly considering the quantity

tr(f(A)) instead of each diagonal entry of f(A). They are very cheap to compute. In a

number of examples our bounds are found to be tighter than Kantorovich's upper bound,

and are equivalent to the Robinson and Wathen's bounds, which is computationally more

expensive. Our experiences indicate that the probabilistic bounds presented in 1] are the

most accurate, but they are also the most expensive ones in terms of computational costs

and memory requirement. In section 2 we present

number of examples, coming from the di erent applications, and comparisons with the

Kantorovich's upper bound, Robinson and Wathen's bounds and the estimates using

Monte Carlo simulation are given in section 3. We give concluding remarks in section 4.

To determine the coe cients c and d, by using (7) with the fact r = r for r = 0; 1; 2, and the prescribed node t0 being the root of the characteristic polynomial (8), we have

c 2 + d 1 ? 0 = 0; ct20 + dt0 ? 1 = 0:

3 Examples

In this section, we use four examples to show the tightness of the bounds given in (9) and (10). We will also compare with the Kantorovich's upper bound (2), Robinson and Wathen's bounds (3) and the approach using Monte Carlo simulation (henceforth the MC estimation) described in 1].
Numerical experiments are carried out in Matlab environment on a SUN Sparcstation 10. The so-called \exact" value of tr(A?1) is computed by analytic formulas if available, or by rst computing the inverse using function inv in Matlab, and then calculating the trace. For the \exact" value of tr(ln(A)) = ln(det(A)), we use the analytic formula if available, or rst compute the Cholesky decomposition of A using Matlab function chol and then compute the natural logarithm of the product of diagonals of Cholesky factor.
Example 1 (Pei matrix): Consider the so-called n-by-n Pei matrix A = I +uuT, where
u = (1; 1; : : :; 1)T 8]. It is easy to see that A has two distinct eigenvalues and n + . The eigenvalue has multiplicity n ? 1. If > 0, A is symmetric positive de nite. By the Sherman-Morrison formula 6], the inverse of A can be written as

A?1 = 1 I ?

Then tr(A?1) = n ? ( n+n) and tr(ln(A)) = (n ? 1) ln + ln( + n). It is easy to compute

= n2 + ( +2)n. If let parameters = and calculation, both lower and upper bounds for Similarly, one can also easily show that both

lower and upper bounds for tr(ln(A)) in (10) are also equal to the exact value. For this

example, the bounds (9) and (10) are perfect! Of course, one can also verify that for this

example, there are no intergration errors (the remainders are zero) in the Gauss-Radau

quadrature rule.

For this example, Robinson and Wathen's bounds for tr(A?1) are also equal to the

exact value.

Example 2 (Poisson matrix): The matrix of order m2 is a block tridiagonal matrix from

the 5-point central di erence discretization of the 2-D Poisson's equation on a m m

square mesh 8]. It can be shown that the parameters and for the bounds of the

Note that the estimates from the Monte Carlo simulation for tr(A?1) and tr(ln(A)) are only at 2% and 0.4% of relative errors of the actual values, respectively 1].

But it is generally poorer than the probablistic bounds and estimations for and ln(det(A)) derived by using Gaussian quadrature and Monte Carlo simulation

1]. The latter costs signi cantly more arithmetic operations and memory. But a fully

parallelism scheme can be developed for the simulation 1].

We point out that using Gaussian quadrature and related theory, we have the ad-

vantage of easily extending the approach for tr(A?1) to tr(ln(A)), while the approaches

based on Kantorovich inequality and variational inequality do not enjoy. If the traces of

higher orders of the matrix power Ar, r 3, are available, then bounds can be further

tightened by using the same technique. Moreover, one could use modi ed moments to

get improved estimates of the quadrature rule.
