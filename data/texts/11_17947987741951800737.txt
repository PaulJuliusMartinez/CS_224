There are a variety of stimuli which

Dr. Bitterman:

I n recent years, one of the most publicized

environ-

mental hazards has been occupational

exposure

to

asbestos (ASB) and ASB-containing

products.

Although

epidemiologic

evidence

has been accumulated

to sup-

port an association

between ASB exposure

and in-

creased incidence of pulmonary

diseases,1 the mecha-

nisms by which ASB exerts its harmful biologic effects

on cells of the human respiratory

tract have not been

delineated,

Pulmonary

alveolar macrophages

(PAMs), phagocy-

tic cells located in the lower respiratory

tract, ingest

various types of foreign particulates

such as dust, bac-

teria and cigarette smoke particles which enter the distal

tracheobronchial

tree. PAMs also represent a primary

pathway

for initial processing

and clearing

of ASB

fibers which have been inhaled into the lung.23 Since

it is virtually indestructible,

ASB poses a unique prob-

lem for PAM detoxification

of these fibers. There is

evidence that these cells convert ASB to a less harmful

form via phagocytosis

and coating of the particles with

cell membrane

components,

acid mucopolysaccarides

and hemosiderin.-6

These coated ASB fibers (ASB

bodies) can readily be found in the sputum and lung

tissues of ASB workers and other individuals

occupa-

tionally exposed to ASB, and also, in fewer numbers, in

CULTURE TIME (HOURS)

Ficunx 1. Effect of uncoated asbestos (ASB) or ASB bodies on viability of cultured human

pulmonary

alveolar macrophages

(PAMs).

Cells were cultured

24-72 hours with 0-300

,g/ml naked ainosite ASB or 0-250 g/ml ASB bodies. Viability was then determined

by

the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Uncoated ASB (n = 5): No cytotoxicity

was observed

following culture of cells with

100 Lg/ml ASB for 24 hours. (P ) 0.05 in all instances;

paired, 2-tailed Student's t-test). Significant

cytotoxicity

was observed for all other con-

centrations

or longer culture intervals with naked ASB (P .( 0.006 in all instances).

ASB

bodies (N = 7): Decreased PAM viability was observed following 24 hours of culture with

ASB bodies (P < 0.032). All other values were not significant (P > 0.05 in all instances).

from

PAMs were obtained from 15 normal healthy, non-smok-

ing volunteers,

21-29 years of age, who had no previous

history of cigarette smoking or occupational

exposure to

ASB or other particulates.

ASB bodies were obtained from

necropsy lung tissue from three ASB insulation workers,

62-78 years of age.

Preparation of PAMs

PAMS were obtained employing

saline lavage with 250

ml sterile 0.15 M NaC1 through a flexible fiberoptic bron-

choscope and prepared as previously described.

Incubation of PAMs with ASB Particles

PAMs were incubated

at 370 C in a CO2 incubator for

24-72 hours with naked amosite ASB (5-100 m in length)

at final concentrations

ranging from 0-300 g/ml or ASB

bodies obtained as previously

described,#{176} at a final con-

centration of 250 ,Lg/ml. Viability of PAMs was determined

by the tiypan blue dye exclusion method.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Procedures

For SEM studies, PAMs were incubated

for the appro-

priate time interval on glass cover slips and processed as

previously

described.

Cells were then examined

with

a JOEL 100 CX electron microscope

equipped

with ASID

RESULTS

PAMs obtained

from healthy nonsmoking

volunteers

were cultured for 24-72 hours with varying concentra-

tions of amosite ASB (0-300 lLg/ml),

then evaluated

by light microscopy

to document

viability

as deter-

mined by trypan blue dye exclusion.

Using this tech-

nique, ASB cytotoxicity

to PAMs was shown to be

both time and dose dependent

(Fig 1). At lower ASB

concentrations,

( 100 ,Lg/ml),

no signfficant

cyto-

toxicity occurred

during the first 24 hours of culture.

However,

cell viability

significanfly

decreased

follow-

ing incubation

for 48

or 72 hours (P < 0.005, paired, 2-tailed t-test). At

higher concentrations

of ASB (>100

ig/ml),

PAM

viability

proportionately

decreased

and significant

cytotoxicity

was observed

after the initial 24 hours of

culture (P < 0.005 in all instances).

When PAMs were incubated

with 250 ,ig/nil ASB

bodies for 24-72 hours (Fig 1), a slight decrease

in

cell viability

(as determined

by the trypan blue dye

exclusion

method)

was demonstrated

after the initial

24 hours of culture (P = 0.032). No further cytotoxicity

was demonstrated,

however,

when PAMs were incu-

bated for the longer time periods of 48 and 72 hours

(P> 0.05 in all instances).

These studies demonstrate

that in contrast

to naked ASB, ASB bodies are only

To further document

that both uncoated

with human

PAMs, SEM

studies were performed

to document

particle phagocy-

tosis. Various stages of phagocytosis

of a large and a

small naked ASB fiber can be seen in this stereo SEM

(Fig 2a). The larger fiber has become completely

en-

shrouded

by the PAM cytoplasmic

membranes.

In

contrast, the smaller ASB fiber is in a much earlier phase

of PAM phagocytosis

and can be seen protruding

hori-

zontally from the apex of the cell. Notice how the

PAM rises vertically

above the glass cover slip sub-

strate.

DISCUSSION

The current

study demonstrates

that while ASB

bodies are ingested

by human

less toxic to PAMs than similar

PAMs, they are much

concentrations

of naked

(uncoated)

ASB fibers. These data thus support the

theory that ASB bodies are less harmful to human lung

cells than uncoated

ASB fibers and agree with a recent

report by Churg and Warnocks

who concluded

that

quantitation

of naked as well as coated ASB fibers in

human tissue and sputum might be essential

for de-

termining

the amount of occupational

exposure as well

as the degree of risk of ASB-related

lung disease to a

given individual.

By utilizing this in vitro experimental

model, it may

be possible to define the interactions

between

human

PAMs and other environmental

particulates

such as

silica and other forms of ASB in future studies. The

information

gained

from such investigations

could

prove beneficial

in delineating

the pathologic

mecha-

nisms of ASB-induced

and other occupationally-related

pulmonary

diseases.

correlation

between

occupational

exposure

of persons to as-

bestos and the increased

incidence

of cancers of several

types, including

those of the respiratory

tract.1'2 Up to

20% of all deaths among workers in some of the asbestos-

using industries

may be related to bronchogenic

car-

cinoma.2 While cigarette

smoking has been definitively

linked to the occurrence

of bronchogenic

carcinoma,

the correlation

between cancer occurrence

and exposure

to asbestos alone does not present as clear a story.3 The

risks inherent

in exposure

to cigarette

smoke residues

and asbestos individually

are not additive;

rather, the

two xenobiotics

act in concert to produce a risk of can-

cer occurrence

exceeding

the sum of the separate risks.

The apparent

synergistic

effects reported between cigar-

rette smoking

and asbestos

exposure

may reflect an

enhancement

by asbestos

of cellular

responses

to the

potentially

carcinogenic

components

of cigarette smoke.

Since cigarette

smoke residues adsorb to the fibers of

asbestos,

providing

a reservoir

of potential

carcinogens

both intracellularly

and in the extracellular

spaces, a

possible mechanism

of asbestos potentiation

of the in

vivo action of cigarette

smoke components

may be

through alteration

of the enzyme systems that metabo-

lize these carcinogens

to their reactive forms.
