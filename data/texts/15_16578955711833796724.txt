A lthough

the characteristic

feature of byssinosis

in

workers exposed to cotton dust is the symptom

of chest tightness

occurring

on the first day back to

work after an absence,

changes in objective

measure-

ments of pulmonary

function

also have been demon-

strated.

Not all byssinotic

patients

show objective

changes,

but as a group they tend to have greater re-

ductions

in the FEy1 over the workshift

than asymp-

tomatic workers and those not exposed to cotton dust.1

The prevalence

of symptoms

and decrements

in pul-

monary

function

increase

with increasing

dust ex-

posure,2 but even high dust levels may be associated

with a low prevalence

of byssinosis if the dust is of low

"biologic

activity."

Reduction

of the biologic activity

of the dust may be important,

since extrapolation

of

dose-response

curves suggests

that even low levels of

dust may be associated

with symptoms

of byssinosis

in

some workers.2

The US Department

of Agriculture

recently

har-

vested a small quantity

of cotton before the opening

of the boils to minimize

the amount of contamination

of the fiber with other materials. We exposed healthy

volunteers

to dust generated

when this cotton was

carded in a model cardroom

and measured

pulmonary

function

before and after exposure

to determine

if

closed boll harvested

cotton dust produced

less biologic

reaction

than dust from standard

harvested

cotton.

MATERIALS

AND METHODS

Volunteers were screened to exclude those with a history

of asthma, use of medications

affecting airway response,

recent acute respiratory

illness, significant heart disease, or

any other medical condition precluding

safe participation

in an exposure study. Baseline spirometry

was performed

on an Ohio 840* waterless spirometer

with flow volume

curves recorded on FM analog tape. At least three accep-

table maneuvers

were obtained

with the difference

be-

tween the two largest values for FEY1 less than 5 percent.

Those with a baseline FEy1 less than 80 percent of pre-

dicted were excluded from participation.

Those subjects not excluded by the screening procedure

were next exposed to a concentration

of approximately

1 mg/m3 of respirable dust from standard cotton for six

hours in the model cardroom at the US Department

of

Agriculture

Cotton Quality Research Station in Clemson,

SC. Spirometry

was performed

before and after the ex-

posure. These subjects also performed

spirometry

before

and after six hours of sitting in the model cardroom with-

out exposure to cotton dust (designated

"background"

exposure).

Subjects who demonstrated

at least a 5 percent

decrement

in FEy1 after six hours of exposure to stan-

dard cotton relative to the change in FEy, with background

exposure were selected for participation.

Those selected

also completed

a modified

Medical

Research

Council

Questionnaire

for occupational

and smoking history and

respiratory symptoms.

On exposure days, each subject performed spirometric tests

and then immediately

entered the model cardroom. Sub-

jects sat in chairs placed around the carding machine and

were moved each 30 minutes, so that they had made a

complete circuit during the exposure period. Subjects were

allowed to leave the cardroom only for restroom breaks

and were not allowed to smoke at any time during the

study. After six hours of exposure, spmrometric testing was re-

peated using the same spirometer

and technician

as in

the pre-exposure

testing. The participants

also answered

the questions "Do you feel different from when the ex-

posure began?" and "If yes, how?"

Respirable

dust sampling was performed

continuously

with four vertical elutriators

(flow rate, 7.4 L/min) around

the card. Dust concentrations

were maintained

at the de-

sired level by varying the card exhaust ventilation.

Four types of closed boll harvested cotton were used for

sat in the cardroom,

but no material

was processed through

the card, labeled

"background"

on the table. The final

group of 26 selected for participation

was then exposed to

the various types of closed boll harvested

cotton and

Stoneville standard cotton in the order shown. Closed boll

harvested

cotton generated

much less dust when carded

at the same production

rate as Stoneville standard cotton,

so the carding rate was increased respirable dust levels comparable

in an attempt to produce to that during the S tone-

vile standard exposure days. Days without exposure were always interposed

between

any two exposures to cotton dust. On days in which no

exposure function

was performed, was measured

the subjects' baseline pulmonary at the same time of day as that

on exposure days to determine

if recovery

and to see if any trend of baseline pulmonary

had occurred function was

occurring.

RESULTS

As shown in Table 2, mean preexposure

FEY1 values

did not change significantly

during the study. Table

3 shows the pulmonary

function

results on the days

in which the subjects were exposed to dust from

Stoneville

standard

cotton. Although

the decrement

in

FEy, showed some variability,

only the decrement

on

August 18 (on which the dust level was 0.75 mg/m')

was significantly

smaller than the others. To simplify

comparisons

in the tables, the decrements

in FEY1 for

the four days on which the subjects were exposed to

Stoneville

standard

cotton dust were combined

to give

an average

combined

decrement

of 5.1 percent,

or

171 ml. However, the actual decrements and variability

of decrements for all days on which a given subject was

exposed to standard

cotton were used in the statistical

comparisons

to responses

from the other types of

exposures.

Table 4 shows that the average change in FEY, on

the day in which the subjects sat in the cardroom,

but

no material

was processed

through

the card (back-

ground exposure),

was a rise of 60 ml, or +1.8 per-

cent. This was not likely a learning

effect, since the

background

exposure

day was actually

the third or

fourth study day for a given subject,

and thus the

subjects had performed

spirometry

at least four times

previously.

Exposure

to dust from rayon produced

a

small but signfficant

decrement

in FEy,

compared

with the background

exposure

day. The SCBR, SCBI,

CHEST, 79: 4, APRIL, 1981 SUPPLEMENT

and LCBR cotton dust exposures

produced

decrements

of FEy1 not significantly

different from that of rayon

but significantly

smaller than that produced

by Stoneville

standard

cotton dust exposures.

The LCBR cotton dust

exposure produced

a significantly

greater decrement

in

FEY, than Stonevifie

standard

cotton dust.

Table 5 shows the results for participants

separated

into smokers and nonsmokers.

The smokers had greater

decrements

in FEY1 for each exposure

type, but the

biologic activity relative to Stoneville

standard

cotton

was different

between

smokers and nonsmokers

only

for LCBR cotton.

On most exposure

days, only one or two subjects

complained

of respiratory

tract symptoms,

usually

coughing,

when questioned

after exposure.

Only one

subject

complained

of the classic cotton exposure

complaint,

chest tightness,

during the experiment.

On

the LCBI exposure

day, however,

13 of the 25 subjects

complained

of coughing.

This is consistent

with the

biologic activity of this dust as measured

by the aver-

age decrement

in FEy1, which also was most pro-

nounced

for the group on this exposure.

However,

as

shown in Table 6, symptomatic

subjects

had only a

slightly greater decrement

in FEY, than asymptomatic

subjects.

Endotoxin

content of the different cottons has been

completed

only on bulk samples (Table 7). LCBI cot-

ton, which had the highest

endotoxin

content,

also

produced overall

the greatest

decrement

in FEY1, but the

correlation

between

endotoxin

content

and

decrement

in FEY1 was not significant.

DIscussIoN

The nature,

source,

and mechanisms

of action of

the substances

in cotton dust that cause the physiologic

response

during exposure

are still not known. Cotton

fibers which

have been

thoroughly

washed

and

bleached

for medical use have low biologic activity.3

Water washing

pears to decrease the bronchoconstricting

properties

of

the dust,'1 but difficulties

in processing

washed cotton

into yarn have so far prevented

this method of control

from use in the textile industry.

Harvesting

of cotton before the natural

opening

of the boll allows better control over contamination

of

the fibers with material from outside the boll. Carding

of closed boll harvested

cotton produced

much less

dust than standard

cotton, and even with reductions

in ventilation,

a carding rate of three to five times

that for standard

cotton had to be used to attain

roughly

equivalent

respirabie

dust concentrations.

Thus, it appears

that significant

reductions

in dust

concentration

could be achieved

in textile mills and

other phases of cotton processing

without

any change

in air-cleaning

equipment

if closed boll harvested

cot-

ton could be successfully

adapted

for commercial

use.

Decrements

in FEY, after six hours of exposure were

significantly

less for Stoneville

during the study, and

the largest decrement

in FEY1 was seen on the next

to last exposure day. Return to the baseline preexposure

value of FEy, had occurred

by the following

morning

after all exposures.

Smokers consistently

showed greater decrements

in

FEY1 than nonsmokers,

but, except for the LCBR

cotton, the relative biologic activity of the cottons was

the same in smokers

and nonsmokers.

to

The difference

noted

for the LCBR cotton could have been a chance cc-

currence

among the multiple

comparisons,

but the

Lubbock

cotton may also have been different

from the

Stoneville

cotton in some fundamental

way. Both

Lubbock

cottons had greater endotoxin

content than

any of the Stoneville

cottons,

including

the standard

type, and the methods

for drying the unopened

boils

were quite different

for Stonevilie

and Lubbock

cot-

tons. Further studies in a second group of subjects to

be reported

separately

have continued

to show differ-

ences in response

to Lubbock

and Stonevilie

closed

boil cottons at equivalent

dust concentrations.

In these

latter studies, constant

carding speed was maintained

for all cottons to preclude

qualitative

differences

in

the dust generated,

as might have occurred

in the

present study.

study may have been due to the differences

in dust

concentrations

for the different

cottons. An accurate

adjustment

for these differences

cannot be made be-

cause only two closely spaced points on the dose-

response

curve for standard

cotton dust were obtained,

and it may not be accurate

to assume a similar slope

for the dose-response

to closed boll cotton dust even

if the slope for standard

cotton dust were known pre-

cisely. However,

using a simple extrapolation

based

on the observed

dose-response

slope for standard

cot-

ton dust, response

to SCBI and LCBR cotton dusts

remained

significantly

lower than the response

to

standard

cotton dust. The same adjustment

applied to

the response

to rayon, results in a larger decline in

FEy, than observed

with standard

cotton exposure.

Whether bract removal is important

in reducing the bio-

logic activity of closed boll cotton cannot be determined

from this study. Likewise,

although

the correlation

of

endotoxin

content and pulmonary

function response was

not significant,

the inhaled dose of endotoxin

may not be

accurately

reflected

in measurements

on random bulk

samples.

Analysis

of airborne

endotoxin

from this and

future studies may allow more definite conclusions

to be

made.

Finally, whether

the acute pulmonary

function

re-

sponse to a six-hour

exposure

in nonbyssinotic

sub-

jects is a valid predictor

of the potential

of a given

type of cotton dust to produce

byssinosis

or permanent

pulmonary

impairment

after long-term

exposure

can

only be determined

from carefully

controlled

prospec-

tive studies.

However,

short-term

exposure

studies

seem to be useful and safe in rapidly estimating

the

relative

effectiveness

of various

experimental

treat-

ments in decreasing

the biologic activity of cotton dust.
