The Early History P. McCorduck
Though our discussion is e n t i t l e d "The History of Artificial Intelligence", in f a c t we are focusing here on one b r i e f but h i g h l y s i g n i f i c a n t moment in t h a t h i s t o r y , the moment when a r t metamorphosed i t s e l f i n t o science, from wish and dream to something l i k e r e a l i t y . As you w i l l learn from each of the discussants, t h i s metamorphosis took place at several locations during the early to mid-1950s, and i t s c a t a l y s t was the r e c o g n i t i o n that the computer was the most promising medium yet in which to r e a l i z e what had been a human dream since e a r l i e s t times, the c r e a t i o n of man-made, rather than begotten intelligence.
Let me remind you of some of the f i r s t manifestations of that dream. A great many a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e s , or automat a , appear in Greek mythology, put t o gether to be useful or to carry out some task t h a t the gods themselves f i n d burdensome.
Around 850 B.C., Homer t e l l s us about poor old ugly Hephaestus, the god of f i r e and the d i v i n e smith, who, because he is c r i p p l e d , has to fashion attendants to help him walk and a s s i s t him in his f o r g e i
These are golden, and in appearance l i k e l i v i n g young women.
There is i n t e l l i g e n c e in t h e i r hearts, and there is speech in them
and s t r e n g t h , and from the immortal gods they have learned how to do things.
From the immortal gods they have learned how to do t h i n g s . There's a phrase so fraught with implications it takes your breath away. For humans to behave l i k e gods--because godlike i t i s t o imbue the inanimate with animation--is hubris i n deed, and no opponent of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e has f a i l e d to express shock at the blasphemous behavior of humans who aspire to divinity.
These opponents themselves, p e r s i s t e n t and a r t i c u l a t e as nearly everyone in the

f i e l d must know from personal experience, represent a tradition as ancient as the urge to create a r t i f i c i a l intelligences.
S l i g h t l y before Homer was c o d i f y i n g what were surely already ancient t r a d i t i o n s , another set of codes was brought down from Mt. Sinai by an u n w i l l i n g prophet named Moses. We know these codes as the Ten Commandments, and i t ' s the second one which is germane here: "Thou s h a l t not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any t h i n g that is in heaven above or t h a t is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the e a r t h j Thou s h a l t not bow down t h y s e l f to them nor serve them, f o r I the Lord thy God am a jealous G o d . . . "
Indeed. No matter that the Lawgiver promptly v i o l a t e s t h a t very commandment in the instructions for building the Ark of the Covenant; the message is c l e a r . If you dabble in that sort of t h i n g , you v i o l a t e the t e r r i t o r y of gods, and we a l l know who rushes in where angels fear to tread.
I l i k e to t h i n k of these two a t t i t u d e s as the Hellenic and the Hebraic. The Hellenic is curious, enthusiastic (a word which i t s e l f means f i l l e d w i t h the breath of the d i v i n e ) and generally at ease w i t h the idea of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e . The Hebraic, on the contrary, holds that the idea of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence is fraudu l e n t , wicked, and even blasphemous.
This is an arbitrary d i s t i n c t i o n when it comes to the a c t u a l business of doing a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e . Past and present, there are devout Jews and Christians untroubled by the idea. For example, among the ardent Christians in the past who f i g ure in t h i s h i s t o r y is Ramon L u l l , a 13th century Spanish mystic who renounced the d i s s o l u t e ways of h i s youth and went o f f to convert the Muslims (Cohen, 1966). It i s n ' t recorded t h a t he had much e f f e c t on them, but they had a profound e f f e c t on him: they introduced him to an Arabic t h i n k i n g machine c a l l e d a z a i r j a . and he rushed back to Christendom with the idea of c o n s t r u c t i n g a t h i n k i n g machine of h i s own c a l l e d , more grandly, the Ars Magna. (This t r a n s l a t e s to The Great Work of A r t ; L u l l was r i g h t at home in a f i e l d not known f o r i t s h u m i l i t y . ) The aim of the Ars Magna was to b r i n g reason to bear on a l l subjects, and thereby a r r i v e a t t r u t h without the trouble of thinking. Be that as it may, L u l l ' s scheme seems to me r e markable not f o r i t s grandiose claims, but because without h e s i t a t i o n it presupposed t h a t human thought could be mechanized.

Other well-known Christians were said to own brazen heads, t h a t i s , automata they had made themselves which were not only proof of t h e i r wisdom in being able to construct such things, but which then went on as consultants to amplify the wisdom of t h e i r c r e a t o r s . My f a v o r i t e story is about the brazen head Albertus Magnus was said to own. "A l o v e l y woman who could speak," says one source, and she so offended A l b e r t u s ' s p u p i l , the young Thomas Aquinas, t h a t he burned it upon the death of his teacher (von Boehn, undated). What on earth did she say? Alas, the story loses some of i t s p i quancy w i t h the f a c t that Albertus outl i v e d h i s celebrated p u p i l by some s i x years.
The s t o r y of Rabbi Loew of Prague and his c r e a t i o n Joseph Golem is so f a m i l i a r that i t ' 8 hardly worth repeating: I merely want to remind you that the legend e x i s t s , and is a l l the more charming f o r the fact that several of the scientists associated w i t h cybernetics and a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e have family t r a d i t i o n s that trace t h e i r genealogy back to the Rabbi.
In s h o r t , my d i v i s i o n between the Hellenic, or positive, or progressive, or irresponsible attitude (depending on your i n c l i n a t i o n ) and the Hebraic, or negative, or backward, or responsible attitude (again, depending on your i n c l i n a t i o n ) is merely a convenient way of i l l u s t r a t i n g t h a t the two a t t i t u d e s have coexisted w i t h equal duration and i n t e n s i t y , which show no sign of abating.
In imaginative l i t e r a t u r e , the Hebraic a t t i t u d e seems usually to have p r e v a i l e d . Dr. Frankenstein found out to his chag r i n what creating an a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i gence w i l l get you, though the r e a l s t o r y is more complicated than t h a t , as are the issues. Later w r i t e r s have been mostly pessimistic f o r the f u t u r e of the human race side by side with a r t i f i c i a l i n telligences, by definition smarter, fast e r , and immune to human f r a i l t i e s . I d o n ' t know whether I count as pessimistic or optimistic Asimov's f i n a l story in his robot series, which gives us a patern a l i s t i c intelligence doing things for our own good and even making us l i k e t h a t state of a f f a i r s (Asimov, 1950).
You may begin to suspect t h a t u n t i l the early 1950s, a l l the media in which a r t i f i c i a l intelligences appear belonged to the realm of make-believei legend, fantasy, novel, play. If you c l a s s i f y s c i entific speculation as fantasy, this is probably true, but if by s c i e n t i f i c specu l a t i o n we mean not only a dream to be pursued but a possible means by which it can be accomplished, then we are in

different t e r r i t o r y . In that case, f i r s t p r i z e goes to Charles Babbage and his colleague the Countess Lovelace.
In 1843, Lady Lovelace published a long and d e t a i l e d d e s c r i p t i o n of Babbage's A n a l y t i c a l Engine, and contrary to the implications of her widely quoted remark t h a t machines can do only what we t e l l them to do, she added t h a t the question of whether such an engine could be said to t h i n k would have to remain open u n t i l they a c t u a l l y constructed one and t r i e d it out (Morrison and Morrison, 1961).
In any event, Babbage and Lady Lovelace considered b u i l d i n g a quick chess machine in order to finance the building of the l a r g e r A n a l y t i c a l Engine, and were only dissuaded when they discovered t h a t Tom Thumb was what the p u b l i c was w i l l i n g to pay to see, and not an automatic chess machine.
Later on, in 1915, two chess machines which played the endgame were constructed by Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, a g i f t e d Spanish inventor. While he declined to claim that his automata were a c t u a l l y thinking, he suggested that we'd better refine our definitions of that process, and t h a t his automata could c e r t a i n l y do many things which were popularly c l a s s i fied as thinking (Randell, 1973).
But the most passionate champion of machine i n t e l l i g e n c e was a man of breathtaking intelligence himself, Alan Turing. An i n t e l l i g e n t machine might only be imp l i c i t in his famous proposal of the Turing machine in 1937, but nobody was more eager than he to make those i m p l i cations e x p l i c i t . He endured a l o t of condescending derision for his dream, but he continued to pursue i t , though the archives give the impression that except f o r one year, he was never able to pursue it as more than a serious hobby.
At the same time that Turing was at work, there was on the opposite side of enemy l i n e s - - t h i s was by now World War I I - - a young engineer who had b u i l t the world's f i r s t up-and-running d i g i t a l computer, installed in his parents' Berlin p a r l o r . His name was Konrad Zuse, and he too was fascinated by the n o t i o n of i n t e l l i g e n t machines. The p o s s i b i l i t i e s of his machine's i n t e l l i g e n c e were clear in h i s mind: by 1943 he was wondering whether it could play a master in chess, and by 1945 he had developed a programming language called the Plankalkul which, he f e l t c e r t a i n , could be used not only for mathematical problem solving but also f o r programming a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i gence problems of many k i n d s , though he believed that real artificial intelligence

was one or two generations away. I s o l a ted by Germany's defeat and post-war proh i b i t i o n s against electronic development, it came as a great shock to him to d i s cover the mid-50s work of some of the people here.
In other words, the i n t e l l i g e n t machine was an idea whose time had come, and it was not only t h a t the computer presented a medium w i t h which such a dream could be r e a l i z e d . There was a c o n s t e l l a t i o n of events, most notably the s h i f t from one dominant paradigm, the physicist's notion of energy, to a new paradigm, the cybern e t i c i s t ' s n o t i o n of i n f o r m a t i o n , and there were the continuing e f f o r t s to describe psychological and b i o l o g i c a l phenomena in mathematical terms.
Because of these convergences, a young assistant professor of mathematics at Dartmouth College named John McCarthy, who himself had been fascinated by these issues for quite a while, suggested to h i s f r i e n d s t h a t some r e a l progress could be made if only a l l of the people at work on these problems--all ten of them--spent the summer of 1956 together, helping each other. These three f r i e n d s , who were Marvin Minsky, another young scholar who was a Harvard Junior Fellow in mathematics and neurology, Nathaniel Rochester, manager of information research at IBM's research center in Poughkeepsie, N, Y., and Claude Shannon, then a mathematician at B e l l Laboratories who had much indeed to do with the paradigm s h i f t from energy to information, agreed that it might not be a bad idea, and joined McCarthy in submitting a proposal to the Rockefeller Foundation f o r "a two-month ten man study of a r t i f i c i a l intelligence to be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of i n t e l l i g e n c e can in p r i n c i p l e be so precisely described t h a t a machine can be made to simulate it."
This was the f i r s t time the term a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e had been used o f f i c i a l l y . John McCarthy won't swear he hadn't heard it before, but he was the f i r s t to apply it to the kind of work which was going on in t h i s f i e l d , he promoted the term, and despite some other proposals and c e r t a i n grumbling, a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e has stuck.
Rockefeller provided $7500 and the i n i t i a l four i n v i t e d others who shared t h e i r f a i t h . Among them were Trenchard More, Arthur Samuel of IBM, O l i v e r S e l f r i d g e and Ray Solomonoff of MIT, and two vaguely known persons from the RAND Corpora-

t i o n and Carnegie-Tech in Pittsburgh named A l l e n Newell and Herbert Simon.
A f t e r a l l t h i s time, no one is q u i t e c e r t a i n how the Cambridge people got in touch w i t h the Carnegie-RAND group, though there are several p o s s i b i l i t i e s : Oliver S e l f r i d g e had given a t a l k at RAND the previous f a l l , and had m i g h t i l y impressed A l l e n Newell, indeed, had turned his s c i e n t i f i c l i f e around. Marvin Minsky was a consultant at RAND and might have known about the work of Newell and Simon that way.
In a d d i t i o n , others oame f o r short v i s i t s to t a l k about related work. Among these v i s i t o r s was Alex Bernstein, then a programmer f o r IBM in New York C i t y , who was i n v i t e d to t a l k about the chess playing program he was working on, a program which was to receive a l o t of subsequent p u b l i c i t y , to the horror of IBM, which feared that the idea of i n t e l l i g e n t machines would be so threatening it would keep customers from buying computers.
If I were to share some of the things the Dartmouth Conference was supposed to accomplish, you might be tempted to laugh. John McCarthy r e c e n t l y took a look at the old proposal and he laughed, and suggested t h a t by changing a few names and d o l l a r amounts, the proposal might well be submitted today, more than twenty years l a t e r , and get a serious reading. He j e s t s . Nobody r e a l l y expected to accomp l i s h a l l the things on the agenda f o r t h a t summer, but n e i t h e r did anyone i n tend to map out his professional l i f e f o r the next twenty years, which in some cases is what happened.
This must be a very parsimonious version of the early history of a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e , and I have hardly attended to those who held--and s t i l l h o l d - - t h a t a r t i f i c i a l intelligence is impossible, undesirable, and not worth the energy spent on i t . The opposition i s n ' t composed e n t i r e l y of cranks --among the skept i c s was John von Neumann--and only time w i l l t e l l who i s r i g h t .
But it seems to me a f i n e thing t h a t some of the greatest v i s i o n a r i e s , g e n i uses and crackpots of the western world have put t h e i r hand to the task of manmade i n t e l l i g e n c e . We sometimes f o r g e t t h a t most s c i e n t i f i c f i e l d s began w i t h ideas t h a t seem a b i t loony to us now, and as a f i e l d takes on r e s p e c t a b i l i t y , it would prefer to forget i t s disreputable antecedents. If we detect lunacy among the e a r l i e s t forerunners, we had b e t t e r admit t h a t it is our very own, and here to stay. It is a l l of us humans who harbor t h a t mysterious but ancient

A r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e comes blessed w i t h one of the r i c h e s t and most d i v e r t i n g h i s t o r i e s i n science because i t addresses i t s e l f t o something so profound and pervasive in the human s p i r i t .
Meanwhile, my s t o r y has come to the place where you can have eyewitness r e ports. To aid us a l l in understanding, I've asked these distinguished eyewitnesses to address some of the f o l l o w i n g questions:
F i r s t , when did the paradigm s h i f t happen f o r you? Put another way, what did you think you were doing before a r t i f i c i a l i n t e l l i g e n c e ? What did t h a t f i e l d look l i k e ? Why wasn't it s u f f i c i e n t ?
Second, what is it t h a t made the comput e r the instrument of choice? Were you looking f o r i t , o r did i t pop u p j u s t i n time?
T h i r d , what made one p r o j e c t or problem more a t t r a c t i v e than another at the time? Why did c e r t a i n kinds of projects seem more appropriate at c e r t a i n times? What were the canons of taste?
F i n a l l y , what should have been the strategy f o r AI in the f i r s t few years a f t e r the Dartmouth Conference in 1956?
Transcripts of the panelists' remarks w i l l be published later in an appropriate journal.
