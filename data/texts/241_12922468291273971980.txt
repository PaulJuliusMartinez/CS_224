Received 27 October 2010; accepted 15 November 2010; published online 6 December 2010 We demonstrate over 1  1010 open-loop switching cycles from a simple memristive device stack of Pt/ TaOx / Ta. We compare this system to a similar device stack based on titanium oxides to obtain insight into the solid-state thermodynamic and kinetic factors that influence endurance in metal-oxide memristors. © 2010 American Institute of Physics. doi:10.1063/1.3524521

Memristive devices have attracted significant attention
because of their great potential for next generation nonvolatile memory,1,2 stateful logic operations via material implication,3 neuromorphic computing,4 and a variety of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor CMOS/ memristor hybrid circuits.5,6 Accordingly, significant
progress has been made in understanding the physical
operating mechanisms as well as in improving the device performance,7­22 leading to the demonstration of nonvolatility, fast switching 10 ns, low energy 1 pJ/ operation, multiple-state operation, scalability,
stackability, and CMOS compatibility for these devices.
However, one of the major challenges for memristors to be used in a universal memory e.g., replacing DRAM as well as Flash or as a Boolean computing device is endurance,1,7 i.e., how many cycles the devices can reversibly and reliably
switch. The endurance values reported in the literature range from 10 to 1  106 cycles and the endurance record has been 1  109 cycles so far.19 Here we demonstrate that the endurance limit of metal-oxide memristive devices has not yet been reached. We have achieved over 1  1010 switching cycles see Fig. 1a in a very simple Pt/ TaOx / Ta device stack while using fixed switching parameters in an open cir-
cuit without any feedback mechanism. The device remains functional even after 15 109 cycles. We have compared TiOx- and TaOx-based memristors with a similar device structure and observed a significantly better endurance in the
latter. Based on these observations and the known phase dia-
grams for the Ti­O and Ta­O systems, we discuss some cri-
teria for material selection to achieve high endurance.
The structure of the Ta oxide devices is schematically shown in the inset to Fig. 1b. The TaOx film was sputterdeposited from a tantalum oxide target with an Ar working
gas pressure of about 3 mTorr. The resulting film had a com-
position of TaO1.7 based on Rutherford backscattering spectrometry characterizations, whereas the nominal composition
of the target was TaO2.0. The substrate was Si with a 200 nm thermal SiO2 film and the device stack typically included a blanket Pt bottom electrode of 100­400 nm, a blanket TaOx layer of about 7­18 nm, and a Ta metal top electrode of 100­400 nm. A very thin 1 nm Ti layer was used between the Pt bottom electrode and the substrate for adhesion pur-
pose. The Ta top electrode had a disk shape with a diameter

of 100 m, defining the device area. This simple device
stack was designed to meet the main structural requirements for a high endurance device: 1 the Ta metal electrode serves as a large reservoir of mobile dopant species O vacancies or possibly Ta interstitials for the electronic switching, 2 the asymmetry of the two interfaces defines a stable switching polarity, 3 the thick metal electrodes serve as
heat sinks and also provide low electrode series resistance, 4 the built-in oxygen deficiency protects the device from gas eruption damage,12 5 the planar structure mitigates the edge effects of a crossbar structure, and 6 the blanket oxide layer effectively isolates the key junction for switching the chemically inert TaOx / Pt interface from air.
The typical switching current-voltage I-V loops of the
TaOx devices are shown in linear and also semilog scales in Fig. 1b. The devices switch at a relatively low voltage,
which is highly desirable for sub-20 nm CMOS drive circuitry. The switching current is less than 100 A even though the device area is very large. The voltage for the first set operation green I-V in Fig. 1b is only slightly larger than the subsequent normal set i.e., device off to device on

switching, suggesting that no dramatic electroforming is required for the device operation. Over 1  1010 switching cycles are shown in Fig. 1a the first 1  109 cycles are shown in Fig. 3b for which fixed voltage pulses of 1 s with about +1.9 V voltage drop across the devices for set and 2.2 V for reset were used for the endurance test in Fig. 1a. The voltages were applied on the Ta top electrode and the Pt bottom electrode was grounded in all the measure-
ments. Because of the parasitic capacitance from the wires and cables, 1 s pulses were used in the experiments reported here, although we have observed sub-10 ns switching
using a high bandwidth fixture and cabling. The devices re-
tained their resistance state after three months at room tem-
perature without significant degradation and are still under-
going endurance and lifetime experiments.
We utilized pressure modulated conductance microscopy12,23 to locate the localized active switching re-
gion within the device area and then prepared a crosssectional sample for transmission electron microcopy TEM through this active region using focused ion beam. The energy-filtered TEM EFTEM zero-loss images and oxygen map of the switching region are shown in Figs. 2a and 2b, respectively. The result from Fig. 2 is that the Ta oxide film
thickness in the switching region was significantly reduced
after the electrical operations. The original thickness of the
TaOx film was about 7 nm, but within the active region of the device, this thickness is reduced by half as shown in Fig. 2a. Additionally, it can be seen from Fig. 2b that the oxygen content in the reduced region is almost as low as that
in the deposited Ta top electrode.
The equilibrium solid-phase diagram for the Ta­O sys-
tem is quite simple; there are only two stable phases for temperatures under 1000 ° C:24 the single-metal-valence
compound Ta2O5 and Ta metal, which can have a few percent of dissolved O and is denoted by TaO. However, there are a large number of metastable phases, including one with
the stoichiometry TaO2 that has the rutile structure. The Ta oxide material deposited by sputtering was electrically insu-
lating and had an overall stoichiometry of TaO1.7, and from our TEM analyses was primarily amorphous with some
nanocrystal inclusions of Ta2O5. The thin conducting region found in the film was likely formed by phase separation of
the metastable deposited material into a thin Ta2O5-x layer and TaO by joule heating, although there is some possibility of solid-state electrochemical reduction during the first
set pulse.
In order to further explore the role of the switching ma-
terial system in the endurance performance of memristive
devices, we prepared Ti oxide devices with a similar device stack to the schematic in Fig. 1b. A pure Ti metal top electrode was found to result in an almost electrically short de-
vice using TiO2 as the switching material because of the

significant reaction to yield more Ti rich stable phases. Therefore, a Ti4O7 metallic film was used as the top electrode, and a thicker TiO2 active layer was used compared to the TaOx device because there are many stable oxides the Magnéli phases25 with a higher O content than Ti4O7, so it is still possible for the TiO2 to be reduced by this metallic oxide electrode layer. Typical endurance results from the TiOx and TaOx devices are presented in Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively. Large fluctuations were observed in both the on and off resistance states of the TiOx device, where the window between on and off states quickly collapsed. The device was not shorted after the collapse and it could be refreshed to reset resistance window again by applying a larger voltage pulse than that used for the endurance test. In contrast, the TaOx device exhibited fairly stable on and off states for over 1  109 switching cycles using fixed amplitude voltage pulses, as shown in Fig. 3b.
The endurance performance difference between these two samples is most likely related to the thermodynamic differences in these two oxide systems, only two stable phases in the Ta­O system24 but a large number, especially an entire series of Magnéli phases, in the Ti­O system.25 For the Ti oxide system, the mechanism of memristive switching involves the drift of positively charged oxygen vacancies VOs into and out of an insulating interfacial region under the applied electric field.26,27 The growth and retraction of a conductive channels in the insulating matrix result in the low and high resistance states.27,28 The conductance channel is a suboxide phase, e.g., Ti4O7 Refs. 8 and 14 that acts as a source/sink of vacancies for an insulating TiO2 matrix, which is where the switching actually occurs. The asprepared sputtered film in the Ta oxide device was amorphous with a nominal composition of TaO1.7, which is an inhomogeneous metastable insulating material.

Working by analogy to the much better understood Ti oxide system, it is likely that the active region of the Ta oxide device phase separates and forms regions of the two stable phases of the Ta­O system under joule heating during the device burn-in stage of the first set operation. The Ta2O5 can serve as the insulating matrix and the TaO solid solution can serve as the conductance channel and the effective source of mobile dopant species. These two phases are nominally in thermodynamic equilibrium, meaning they will not react with each other even under an elevated temperature caused by joule heating in the devices. As a result, the device can sustain a large voltage amplitude without any significant chemical changes.
This is demonstrated in Figs. 3c and 3d, showing the resistance changes of the devices under accumulating voltage pulses of different amplitudes. Each blue data point represents a 1 s electrical pulse, with the bottom scale of the plots representing the voltages applied external voltages, which are larger than the internal voltage drops across the devices. Starting from a high resistance off state, the devices were first set by positive voltage pulses with an increasing voltage magnitude. At an apparent voltage threshold of +1 V for the TaOx device in Fig. 3d which since these are dynamical devices, will be different for different pulse widths, the device was quickly set to a low resistance on state. Then the pulses were inverted in polarity to negative voltages, and starting from the on state, the resistance increased at 2 V and then remained in a fairly stable off state despite a large overdrive with negative voltage pulses. In sharp contrast, the TiOx device exhibited an unstable reset switching behavior under increasing negative voltage pulses, as can be seen in Fig. 3c, where the resistance of the device first decreased, then increased to the off state, but decreased again under overdrive conditions. We attribute this unstable behavior to the fact that the conductive channel material is not in equilibrium with the insulating matrix material in the TiOx device and complicated chemical reactions continue to be activated by joule heating when overdriven. However, a slight overdrive is necessary in endurance tests in order to compensate for the variance in the effective write threshold voltage from cycle to cycle and avoid bit errors during writing, which thus has a negative impact on the endurance for the TiOx device.
It is notable that in the literature, the two cases where 1  109 switching cycles have been reported in oxide switches are in the Ta­O Ref. 19 and Hf­O Refs. 22 systems. These two binary systems share the same features, namely, only two stable solid phases in bulk equilibrium with each other, one of which is insulating and the other is a conducting phase the metal with a large oxygen solubility, which can act as the source/sink of mobile ions for switching in the insulating phase. For oxide systems without these features, such as WOx and TiOx, a sophisticated feedback mechanism to avoid overdriving29 or an additional step of refreshing of the devices with stronger voltage pulses30 were needed in order to obtain a lower record endurance in the range of 10 106 switching cycles.
