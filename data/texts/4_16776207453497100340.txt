ABSTRACT: 

Mapping and monitoring the intricate cropping pattern of Egypt 's 'old agricultural lands ' constitutes an enormous challenge 
for government ministries tasked with their annual inventory.  Having a year-round favorable climate with several cropping 
seasons,  fertile  alluvial soils,  and a dependable high-quality water supply for irrigation, Egypt has  some of the richest 
agricultural resources in the world.  Millions of acres of the Nile Delta and Valley have been under continuous cultivation 
for several millennia.  Land division over time has resulted in seventy percent of farms being one acre or less in size.  The 
cropping pattern is dynamic due  to the  small size of individual fields  and the intensive,  year-round crop rotation.  The 
acquisition of accurateand timely crop data is essential for efficient management of Egypt 's complex agricultural production 
system and vast irrigation and drainage networks.  This paper will present an overview of how the Government of Egypt 
has conducted agricultural inventories in the past and at present.  Recent applications of photographic and non-photographic 
remote sensing technologies for crop survey in Egypt will be  described.  Capabilities and limitations of satellite image 
classification and aerial photo interpretation will  be compared and contrasted for practical use in monitoring change in 
Egypt's old agricultural lands.

INTRODUCTION 

AGRICULTURAL LANDS  IN EGYPT 

A prolonged drought in  the  mid  1970s  to  1980s in  East 
Central Africa resulted in alarmingly low water levels in 
Egypt's  High  Aswan Dam.  This alerted the Government 
of Egypt of the necessity to conserve and more efficiently 
manage  its  limited  water resources.  At  the  same  time, 
Egypt's rapidly increasing population - which more than 
doubled between  1960 and  1990 -
is placing increased 
demands  on  the country's limited  supply of agricultural 
land which is being lost to expansion of urban areas.  At the 
same time  new  agricultural lands are increasingly being 
reclaimed from deserts and wetlands. 

Accurate water requirement data for agricultural lands is a 
key element needed for efficient management of irrigation 
and drainage systems.  Water needs, irrigation scheduling 
and drainage requirements are highly dependent on crop(cid:173)
ping throughout an irrigation system. 

Remote  sensing  can  provide  agricultural  inventory  data 
required by irrigation system managers to more efficiently 
manage the finite water resources of Egypt.  The focus of 
this paper is practical - what has  actually  been accom(cid:173)
plished by interpretation/classification of remote sensing 
data - versus theoretical- what might be accomplished 
by  interpretation/classification of data from a particular 
sensor. 

Over  the  past  several  decades  there  has  been  increased 
discussion in Egypt over the size of the total area of land 
under cultivation and the area occupied by the main crop 
varieties.  Agricultural data is generated by different gov(cid:173)
ernment  ministries- at  times  with  conflicting  results. 
Table  1 summarizes area estimates of cultivated land in 
Egypt over the past ninety years.  Of particular interest is 
a large unexplained apparent increase in total area under 
cultivation  by  approximately  500,000 feddans  between 
1981  and  1982.  All of the cultivated land data listed in 
Table  1  was  collected  by  direct  field  observation  and 
annotation of large scale cadastral maps or aerial photo(cid:173)
graphs except for the  1976 data which was obtained from 
classification  of satellite  imagery.  Field  annotation  of 
large scale maps is the predominant method of crop data 
collection by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Egyptian 
Survey Authority.  The Ministry of Agriculture  collects 
data  on  up  to  22  crop  types  on  an  annual  basis.  The 
Egyptian Survey Authority collects data on wheat, rice and 
cotton annually.  Field observations are made at the village 
level and data are condensed to the agricultural district and 
larger administrative levels. The accuracy and consistency 
of data collected in this manner is frequently questioned. 
This  is  why  remote  sensing  solutions  for  annual  crop 
inventory are currently being explored.

AGRICULTURAL REMOTE SENSING 

Agricultural scientists in Egypt need to develop a sustain(cid:173)
able,  efficient and cost effective method of meeting  the 
annual agricultural data needs for the country.  Some form 
of remote sensing will likely be part of the strategy.  The 
essence of agricultural remote sensing is the collection and 
measurement  of electromagnetic  radiation  reflected  by 
vegetation,  soil,  water  and  other features  of the  earth's 
surface.  A knowledge of actual ground conditions makes 
it possible to interpret remote sensing data which encom(cid:173)
passes  both photographic and non photographic  sensors. 
All  remote  sensing  data  types  have  their  limitations, 
however.  What needs to be done is to match the data needs 
of the user with the appropriate technology that has dem(cid:173)
onstrated that it can meet those needs given the constraints 
presented by the intricate cropping environment of the old 
agricultural lands of Egypt. 

Satellite Sensors 

images  are  composed  of discrete  picture  ele(cid:173)

ments,  or pixels.  Pixel  sizes  vary  for  different  satellite 
sensors.  Early (1972) Landsat 1-5  Multi .s.pectral.s.canner 
(MSS)  images have a  pixel  size of 57m by  79m.  Later 
(1982)  Landsat  multi  spectral  Thematic  Mapper  (TM) 
images  have  a  smaller pixel  size  of 30m by  30m.  The 
French  Satellite  Probatoire  d'Observation  de  la  Terre 
(SPOT), in operation since 1986, has the smallest currently 
available  spatial 
resolution  in  both  the  multi-spectral 
(20m)  and  panchromatic  modes  (10m).  SPOT  sensors 
were  designed  primarily  for  mapping  applications  and 
include a stereoscopic coverage capability. 

Image resolution is an important factor in feature identifi-

aI., 1981). Table 2 summarizes pixel size and approximate 
resolution of multi-spectral satellite data currently avail(cid:173)

Resolution 

Throughout remote sensing literature,  diversity exists in 
discussion of image processing and classification as related 
to sensor measurement resolution.  Itis generally accepted, 
however, that resolution strongly influences the accuracy 
of interpretations that may be obtained (Lintz and Simonett, 
1976). 

Four types of resolution are generally recognized; spatial, 
spectral, radiometric and temporal (American Society of 
Photogramrnetry, 1983).  The two types most important in 
remote sensing agricultural inventories (spatial and spec(cid:173)
tral) are discussed in the following sections. 

Spatial Resolution 

Spatial resolution refers to the fineness of detail depicted in 
an image.  It describes the minimum size of objects on the 
ground that can be separately distinguished or measured. 
In satellite scanner systems this is expressed as the instan(cid:173)
taneous field of view (IFOY) which is an angular measure 
In  photographic  systems  spatial 
expressed  in  radians. 
resolution is expressed as line pairs per millimeter that can 
be resolved on the film.  Spatial resolution combined with 
complexity  of  the  landscape  place  practical  limits  on 
interpretation capability and classification accuracy. 

Previous researchers  conducting agricultural  inventories 
using non photographic sensors have developed guidelines 
relating  spatial  resolution  as  expressed  by  the  ground(cid:173)
projected instantaneous-field-of-view (IFOY) of satellite 
sensors to an ability to discriminate crop types.  In North 
America and the USSR, field sizes are such that Landsat 
MSS data, with a ground-projected IFOY of about  80m x 
80m, has  been  shown  to  be marginally adequate in crop 
discrimination studies (American Society of Photo gram(cid:173)
metry,  1983).  Other research  (Harmage and Landgrebe, 
1975) has  shown that identification and analysis become 
acceptable when fields  are greater than 64 pixels in  size 
(Slater,  1980).  When applied to TM and SPOT imagery 
this relationship gives approximate minimum field sizes 
needed for identification and analysis to  be  13.7 feddans 
for TM and 5.7  feddans for SPOT.  In the old agricultural 
lands of Egypt approximately seventy percent of all farms 
are one feddan or smaller in size.  It is clear that the spatial 
resolution  of current  satellite  sensors  presents  a  severe 
limitation in the effective use of these  sensors for agricul(cid:173)
tural inventories. 

Spectral Resolution 

Spectral resolution refers to the width of the regions in  the 
electromagnetic spectrum that are sensed and the number 
of channels used (Lintz and Simonett, 1976).  The number 
and widths of spectral bands available forprocessing are an 
important  factor  in  image  classification  potential.  The 
Landsat Thematic Mapper sensor operates in seven wave(cid:173)
bands  in  the  visible,  near infrared,  middle  infrared  and 
thermal infrared regions of the spectrum (Table 3).

For agricultural mapping applications Landsat Thematic 
Mapper data  has  better  spectral  resolution  available  for 
processing and classification.  SPOT data, however, have 
greater spatial resolution.  Actual  results  of agricultural 
classifications in Egypt with each of these sensors follow. 

Satellite Image Classification 

In a conventional spectral classification of an image each 
pixel is assigned to a certain class, e.g. crop, urban, natural 
vegetation,  desert.  Every  pixel  in  an  image  contains 
spectral information averaged over the area covered by the 
picture element.  Because a pixel grid is  arbitrarily  over(cid:173)
lain on a landscape, not every pixel belongs to one distinct 
class.  If a pixel comprises more than one class, e.g. rice, 
cotton  and  fallow,  the  spectral  information  from  these 
classes is recorded as an mixture of all three.  Such a pixel 
is  called  a  boundary  or  mixed  pixel.  The  number  of 
boundary  pixels  in  any  given  image  is  dependent  on 
resolution of the  sensor and the complexity of the  land(cid:173)
scape. In the case of agricultural inventories, average field 
size, variability  of the crop planting calender and image 
acquisition date influence the level of detail and accuracy 

possible.  Small fields and a dynamic crop calender com(cid:173)
bine to increase the number of boundary pixels in an image. 
A high percentage of boundary pixels in an image restricts 
both the number of discrete land-use classes that can be 
identified and  the  overall  accuracy of the  classification. 
Factors  affecting classification  accuracy for crop  inven(cid:173)
tory in Egypt's old agricultural lands are detailed below. 

§  Complexity of the landscape 
•  Number of crops planted 
•  Average field or plot size 
•  Variability of crop planting dates 
•  Stressed crop conditions 
•  Degree of intercropping 
•  Uniformity of soil conditions 

§  Number of classes to be distinguished

Figure I  illustrates how pixel grids when overlaid on small 
fields  can  result  in  many  pixels  having  mixed  spectral 
signatures  (boundary  pixels).  In  this  figure  pixel  grids 
representative of Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, SPOT multi 
spectral and CIR aerial photography (1:20,000  scale) are 
compared. 

Previous Satellite Agricultural Remote Sensing 
Studies in Egypt 

Processing of satellite imagery for use in agricultural in(cid:173)
ventories has been attempted in Egypt since 1983 when the 
Remote  Sensing  Center  of  the  Academy  of  Scientific 
Research conducted the first estimation of irrigated agri(cid:173)
cultural areas in Egypt using digital processing of Landsat 
multi-spectral  scanner data.  This study determined that 
the total area of irrigated agricultural land in Egypt during 
the  1976  winter season was  5.84 million feddans.  Re(cid:173)
searchers  concluded that Landsat MSS image resolution 
was  not satisfactory for crop differentiation in Egypt be(cid:173)
cause of the small field sizes involved (Hady et ai,  1983). 

In 1986, IWACO, Consultants of Water and Environment, 
Rotterdam, The Netherlands in cooperation with the Egyp(cid:173)
tian Survey Authority used Landsat TM images (February 
and July, 1985) ofthe Fayoum, Egypt to determine the total 
area of cultivated land, waterlogged and saline areas and to 
document the growth of urban areas (Wolters et aI., 1989). 
The authors concluded that "in the Fayoum,  satellite re(cid:173)
mote sensing probably cannot help in making a detailed 
crop map  because of the small field size and fragmented 
land use."  The authors observed that in irrigated areas of 
the world with  small average field  sizes classification of 
any accuracy is impossible if the land use is complex, with 
many different crops in different stages of growth next to 
each other (Wolters et aI.,  1989). 

In 1988, the Institute Oeographique National (ION), Paris, 
France and  the Egyptian  Survey Authority,  produced a 
1: 100,000 scale thematic map of the Fayoum, Egypt using 
SPOT imagery  (Bakir et aI.,  1989).  The goal of this study 
was to obtain an accurate assessment of the cultivated area 
of the Fayoum.  The researchers used a supervised  classi-

differentiation  of  these  four  classes  were  found  to  be 
problematical.  IGN and Bakir concluded that classifica(cid:173)
tion of the SPOT image yielded data on arable land area 
which  correlated  closely  with  data  obtained  by  photo 
interpretation. 

In 1989, the International Institute for Land Reclamation 
and Improvement (IW ACO), Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 
classified Landsat Thematic  Mapper images  of the  Nile 
delta and Nile Valley for the Ministry of Public Works and 
Water  Resources  (MPWWR).  A  supervised  maximum 
likelihood classification  (bands  2,  3,  4  and 7)  of a July, 
1987 Landsat Thematic Mapper scene of the Nile Valley

Aerial Photographic Interpretation 

Aerial photography has  been  widely  used in the United 
States since the  1930s for crop inventories.  Determining 
the amount ofland planted to specific crops has historically 
been  an  important  activity  of the  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture, and aerial photography has long provided that 
agency with a cost -effective and timely means of obtaining 
such data (Rundquist et aI.,  1988).  Traditionally,  black(cid:173)
and-white  (or  "panchromatic")  aerial  photography  has 
been the most common information source.  With this type 
of film, the various colors and patterns of the land surface 
are depicted as a series of gray tones ranging from white to 
black.  Panchromatic  film  is  still  widely  used for  many 
agricultural  applications  despite  the  fact  that,  in  some 
cases, it is difficult to distinguish between different types 
of crops. 

Color infrared  (CIR)  film  is  a  relatively recent develop(cid:173)
ment  and  is  widely  used  in  the  United  States  for  crop 
inventory and analysis.  CIR film has the advantage that it 
is sensitive to near infrared radiation which is part of the 
light spectrumjust beyond the sensitivity of the human eye. 
Vegetation exhibits a much higher sensitivity in the near(cid:173)
infrared wavelengths than in the visible wavelengths. Near 
infrared  sensitive  films  record  an  entire  range  of tone 
gradations  in  vegetation  which cannot be recorded with 
standard color  and panchromatic  films.  Crop  types  are 
delineated  by  classical  photo  interpretation  techniques 
involving human interpretation of photo tone  and color, 
texture, size, shape, pattern and site association.  CIR film 
offers the greatest reliability for single-date crop discrimi(cid:173)
nation (A very, 1985).  Where interpretation is based solely 
on panchromatic photography,  crop  identification  is  ex(cid:173)
tremely difficult unless  multi-date photography is  avail(cid:173)
able.  As  with spaceborne sensor data,  the date of photo 
acquisition in relationship to the crop calender is a critical 
factor for classification accuracy. 

Photographic Agricultural Inventories in Egypt 
Currently the USAID funded Survey and Mapping (S&M) 
Project is  conducting  a  crop  and  soil  mapping program 
interpreting 1 :20,000 CIR film transparencies of the Nile 
Delta  to  produce  digital  crop  and  soil  overlays  for  the 
Winter 90-91 and Summer91 crop seasons. This is the first 
time that CIR film has been used for crop classification in 
Egypt.  Detailed crop inventory is possible with 1 :20,000 
scale CIR film transparencies because of their high spatial 
resolution  (greater  than  one  meter)  and  unique  spectral 
properties.  The minimum mapping unit size of the current 
project is 0.6 feddans.  Photo polygons will be transferred 
to 1: 10,000 orthophoto base maps. Resultant crop overlays 
will be scan digitized into a geographic information sys(cid:173)
tem.  The crop and soil classification legend for the Winter 
90-91  season is listed in Table 10. 

CIR aerial photography has an added advantage for crop 
studies in Egypt that it can be used to interpret and map 
stressed crop areas. In Egypt, stressed crops are commonly 
associated with soil salinity and water-logging caused by 
over irrigation  and/or inadequate drainage.  A  secondary 
goal of the CIR mapping program of the S 8: M Project is to 
delineate  areas  where  crop  growth  is  being  adversely

an  excellent remote  sensing  medium for  this  kind  of an 
inventory. 

One major  disadvantage of aerial photography is its high 
cost  per  unit  area.  Table  11  lists  a  cost  comparison  of 
different  remote  sensing  coverages  available  in  Egypt.

SUMMARY 

Accurate  measurements  of Egypt's  agricultural  areas  is 
needed for development, calibration and maintenance of 
complex water allocation,  irrigation and agro-economic 
models  used  by  ministries of the Government of Egypt. 
The selection of an appropriate remote sensing technology 
for  agricultural inventory  should be  based on what will 
most efficiently and cost effectively  meet the users agri(cid:173)
cultural data requirements. 

As  can  be  seen  by  the  project  summaries  outlined  in 
previous sections, satellite remote sensing has proven to be 
able to provide accurate data on total area of cultivated land 
in Egypt and areas of two crops in the summer season (rice 
and cotton) and one crop in the winter season (wheat).  The 
current problem with  satellite image classification is the 
complex nature of the landscape of Egypt's old agricultural 
lands with small field sizes and non uniform planting dates. 
These  conditions  have  resulted  in  image  classifications 
which, to date, have demonstrated only limited capability 
for obtainment of detailed crop information. 

If five  or more crop classes are required by  the user and 
crop  areas  need  to  be  spatially  located the  only  proven 
techniques to accomplish this level of classification detail 
are; 

1.  Photo interpretation of color infrared aerial photogra(cid:173)

2.  Refinement and automation of the current field map an-

notation approach. 

is  adequate  a 

If  a  non-spatial  estimate  of crop  areas 
stratified  statistical  sampling  (area  sampling frame)  ap(cid:173)
proach  may  be  a  solution  (Hassan  and  Wigton,  1990; 
Spiers,  1977).  This  technique  uses  multiple  layers  of 
remote sensing data at different scales to  yield crop area 
estimates with only  one to two per cent of the survey area 
requiring aerial photography (Wigton,  1977). 

Ultimately, the end data user must determine the level of 
detail required for the agricultural data needed.  Appropri(cid:173)
ate remote sensing technology can then be applied-either 
photographic  or  non-photographic-to  satisfy  the  data 
needs of the user.

Remote sensing is a dynamic technology. Future advances 
in  satellite  scanners  and  image  processing  software  re(cid:173)
quires continued research in classification capabilities of 
satellite remote sensing data.  At some point in the future, 
detailed crop inventories using satellite data may be pos(cid:173)
sible,  even  with  the complex cropping pattern dynamics 
present in Egypt's old agricultural lands.
