WHAT IS COMPUTING WITH WORDS (CW or CWW)?
z Computing with Words is a system of computation which offers an important capability that traditional systems do not have--a capability to compute with information described in natural language.

z Computing with Words opens the door to a wide-ranging enlargement of the role of natural languages in scientific theories.

LAZ 2/4/2010

NUMBERS ARE RESPECTED--WORDS ARE NOT
z In science and engineering there is a deep-seated tradition of according much more respect to numbers than to words. The essence of this tradition was stated succinctly by Lord Kelvin in 1883.

4 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

z "In physical science the first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it.

5 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

z I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the state of science, whatever the matter may be."

6 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

KEY POINT
z In Computing with Words, words are precisiated. Through precisiation words in a natural language can serve as objects of computation and precise reasoning.
z It is this possibility that Lord Kelvin did not anticipate.
z Surprisingly, the concept of precisiation, in the sense in which it is used in CW, does not exist within linguistics or computational linguistics.

7 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED

z The importance of Computing with Words derives from the fact that much of human knowledge--and especially world knowledge--is based on perceptions.

z In large measure, a natural language is a system for describing perceptions.
8 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

z The point of departure in CW is a question, q, of the form: What is the

value of a variable, X. Associated with q

is a question-relevant information set, I,

expressed as X is I, meaning that an

answer to q, Ans(q/I) is to be deduced

(computed) from I. Typically, I consists

of a collection of propositions, p1, ..., pn, in which some or all of the pi, i=1, ..., n, are expressed in a natural

language. The pi are carriers of information about X.
9 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED

z Furthermore, some of the pi may be drawn from external sources of information, typically from world knowledge. A pi drawn from an external source is identified as +pi.
z Computation of Ans(q/I) is described in part by an aggregation function, f.
z Following is a very simple example of a problem which follows within the province of CW.

EVOLUTION OF CW

Level 0. Computing with Numbers (CN)
Carriers of information are numbers.
Example: Age(Vera) is 55
Level 1. Computing with Words (CW)
Carriers of information are numbers + words. Typically, it includes a collection of fuzzy if-then rules.
Primary paper: Zadeh 1973 "Outline of a new approach to the analysis of complex systems and decision processes."

15 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED
This paper introduces the concepts of a linguistic variable and fuzzy if-then rule. Today, most applications of fuzzy logic are centered on these concepts.
Example: Age(Vera) is middle-aged
Level 2. Computing with Words (CW)
Carriers of information are numbers + words + propositions.
Primary paper: Zadeh 1999 "From computing with numbers to computing with words--from manipulation of measurements to manipulation of perceptions.

This paper opens the door to a wideranging enlargement of the role of natural languages in scientific theories. What is called CW today is Level 2 CW. However, much of the literature is still focused on Level 1 CW.

Example: Age(Vera) is I(p1; p2; +p3)

WHAT ARE THE RATIONALES FOR STATING PROBLEMS IN A NATURAL
LANGUAGE?
Point of departure: z Words are less precise than numbers z Precision carries a cost

z Rationale A. Numbers are not known. Use words when for one reason or another it is infeasible to use numbers. Imprecision is forced.

26 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED

z Rationale B. Numbers are not needed. (Good enough rationale)

There is a tolerance for imprecision. Exploit the tolerance for imprecision by employing words in place of numbers, aiming at reduction in cost and achieving simplicity. Imprecision is deliberate.

27 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED
z Today, most of the applications of fuzzy logic, especially in the realm of consumer products, are based on Rationale B. A key role is played by linguistic summarization.

EPILOGUE
z In large measure, CW is rooted in my 1973 paper in which the concepts of a linguistic variable and fuzzy if-then rule were introduced. In retrospect, these concepts may be viewed as a first step toward moving from computing with numbers to computing with words.

42 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED
z The countertraditional spirit of moving from the use of numbers to the use of words evoked criticism and derision rather than approbation. What was not recognized is that the deliberate sacrifice of precision was a gambit--a gambit which opened the door to important applications.
z A typical reaction was that of Rudolf Kalman, a brilliant system scientist and a good friend.

(Kalman 1972)
"I would like to comment briefly on Professor Zadeh's presentation. His proposals could be severely, ferociously, even brutally criticized from a technical point of view. This would be out of place here. But a blunt question remains: Is Professor Zadeh presenting important ideas or is he indulging in wishful thinking?

BASIC STRUCTURE OF CW
z As was stated earlier, the point of departure in CW is twofold. (a) A question of the form: What is the value of a variable, X? and (b) a question-relevant information set, I, expressed as X is I, from which an answer to q, Ans(q/I) is to be deduced.

46 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

BASIC STRUCTURE OF CW
z Typically, I consists of a collection of propositions, p1, ..., pn, in which some or all of the pi, i=1, ..., n, are expressed in a natural language. The pi are carriers of information about X. It is open if inclusion of propositions drawn from external sources of information is allowed. It is close if inclusion is not allowed.

47 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

z An aggregation function, f, serves as a means of computation of Ans(q/I) given q and I.
z The principal components of CW are q, I and f.

48 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

BASIC STRUCTURE OF CW

z Computation of Ans(q/I) is carried out in two phases.

z Phase 1, called Precisiation, involves precisiation of q and I, leading to precisiated q, q*, and precisiated I, I*.

z Phase 2, called Computation, involves computation with q* and I*, leading to Ans(q/I).

z The point of departure in fuzzy logic is the concept of a fuzzy set. Informally, a fuzzy set is a class with unsharp boundary.

LAZ 2/4/2010

KEY POINTS

z fuzziness = unsharpness of class boundaries
z In the real world, fuzziness is a pervasive phenomenon.
z To construct better models of reality it's necessary to develop a better understanding of how to deal precisely with unsharpness of class boundaries. In large measure, fuzzy logic is motivated by this need.

52 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED

z A fuzzy set, A, in a space, U, is

precisiated through graduation,

that is, association with a

membership function, A, which assigns to each object, u, in U its

grade of membership, A(u), in U. Usually A(u) is a number in the [0,1], in which case A is a fuzzy set

of type 1. A is a fuzzy set of type 2

if A(u) is a fuzzy set of type 1.

GRADUATION--ELICITATION
z Humans have a remarkable capability to graduate perceptions, that is, to associate perceptions with degrees on a scale. It is this capability that is exploited for elicitation of membership functions.

Example

z Robert tells me that Vera is middle-aged. What does Robert mean by middle-aged? More specifically, what is the membership function that Robert associates with middleaged? I elicit the membership function from Robert by asking a series of questions.

59 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

GRADUATION--ELICITATION

Procedure
z Typical question: What is the degree to which a particular age, say 43, fits your perception of middle-aged? Please mark the degree on a scale from 0 to 1 using a ballpoint pen. Repetition of this question leads to membership function of type 1. Use of a spray pen (Z-mouse) leads to a membership function of type 2.

60 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

THE CONCEPT OF GRANULATION
z The concept of granulation is unique to fuzzy logic and plays a pivotal role in its applications. The concept of granulation is inspired by the way in which humans deal with imprecision, uncertainty and complexity.

z Granulation serves as a means of imprecisiation (coarsening of information).

PREAMBLE
z In one form or another, precisiation of meaning has always played an important role in science. Mathematics is a quintessential example of what may be called a meaning precisiation language system.

75 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

KEY POINTS

z In CW, the concept of precisiation has a special meaning. First, unless stated to the contrary, precisiation should be interpreted as precisiation of meaning rather than precisiation of value. More specifically, if p is a semantic entity-- typically a proposition--then precisiation of p involves a conversion of p into a semantic entity p* which is required to be mathematically welldefined and computation-ready.

76 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

KEY POINTS
z What this means is that p* should qualify to serve as an object of computation.
z In CW, precisiation is aimed at conversion of p into a generalized assignment statement or, equivalently, a generalized constraint. A generalized constraint may be viewed as a model of p.
p precisiation X isr R

77 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED
z Second, a desiderato of precisiation is high cointension. Informally, cointension is a qualitative measure of proximity of the meanings of p and p*, with the object of precisiation, p, and the result of precisiation, p*, referred to as the precisiend and precisiand, respectively.

COINTENSION PRINCIPLE

z A precisiand has a multiplicity of precisiends.
z Achievement of cointension precisiation necessitates that if the precisiend is fuzzy so must be the precisiand.
z Crisp definitions of fuzzy concepts is the norm in science. What is widely unrecognized is that crisp definitions of fuzzy concepts are generally not cointensive.
z In fuzzy logic the drawing instrument is a spray pen (Z-mouse) which has an adjustable precisiated spray pattern.

z The predicate p: most tall Swedes, may be reworded in two different ways: most of tall Swedes, and mostly tall Swedes. In this case, the precisiend is ambiguous, and rewording involves its disambiguation. Another example: the news is not very good, is reworded as: the news is very (not good).

LAZ 2/4/2010

PRECISIATION--PHASE 2
z Phase 2 involves graduation of fuzzy words in p, that is, association of such words with their membership functions. For example, graduation of p: most Swedes are tall, involves association of most and tall with their respective membership functions.

LAZ 2/4/2010

PHASE 3--PRECISIATION OF

PROPOSITIONS

z Phase 3 is the principal component of

precisiation and is what differentiates

Level 2 CW from Level 1 CW. In a

general setting, composition is carried

out through the use of fuzzy-logic-

based test score semantics (Zadeh

1981, 1983, 1986). For the simple

examples which we are considering,

composition may be carried out by

inspection.

87 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED
z In CW, a proposition, p, is viewed as an answer to a question, q, of the form, q: What is the value of a variable, X, which is explicit or implicit in p? What this implies is that given p there exists a variable, X, such that p may be viewed as an answer to the question: What is the value of X?

88 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

Example:

CONTINUED

Vera is middle-aged is an answer to the question: What is Vera's age?

z As an answer to a question, q, a proposition, p, may be viewed as a carrier of information about X.

z More concretely, p, may be viewed as a generalized assignment statement (Zadeh 1986) which assigns a value, R, to X. R may be explicit or implicit in p.

89 /149

LAZ 2/4/2010

CONTINUED

z Equivalently, a proposition, p, may be viewed as a generalized constraint, with X and R being the constrained variable and the constraining relation, respectively. The meaning of p may be represented as a generalized constraint.

X isr R

where r defines the modality of the constraint, that is, the way in which R constrains X.

KEY POINT
z In summary, in CW, the meaning of a proposition, p, is represented as a generalized assignment statement or, equivalently, as a generalized constraint.
The meaning of p is defined by procedures which compute the constrained variable, X, the constraining relation, R, and the modality, r.

LAZ 2/4/2010

NOTE
z It is important to note that X need not be a scalar variable. X may be vectorvalued or, more generally, have the structure of a semantic network. For example, in the case of the proposition, p: Robert gave a ring to Anne, X may be the three-tuple (Giver, Recipient, Object), with the corresponding constraining relation, R, being (Robert, Anne, Ring).

THE CONCEPT OF LINGUISTIC VALUATION
z When it is desirable to underscore that a proposition, p, is represented as a generalized constraint, it is referred to as a valuation. When a proposition drawn from a natural language is represented as a generalized constraint, it is referred to as a linguistic valuation.

96 /149
